Create a new Alarm.\n2. Choose either one song or create a playlist of songs to shuffle.\n3. Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

      "label": "Undulator is Eventide’s classic modulated tremolo effect from the iconic H3000 effects processor. This unique, rhythmic effect combines ethereal feedback and detuned echos, run through an AM / FM modulated tremolo. Whether used for manipulating samples or adding movement to strings, pads, guitars, and keys, Undulator is a muse for creative musicians. Add Undulator into your plug-ins collection for the most playable tremolo-style effect on your DAW or iOS device.\n\nUndulator excels at evolving pads, sync’d chops, and time-lapsing dreamy soundscapes. Combined with a multi-tap delay and powerful tremolo, Undulator’s controls give any sound sustain and shape. This is perfect for transforming ordinary synths, keys, guitars, and even vocals into evolving pads, tempo synced production elements, or ethereal and fluctuant delays. Simply put, Undulator can make shorter sounds into longer layered effects, and give sustaining sounds shape and rhythmic character.\n\nUse the Ribbon to morph tremolo patterns into vacillating and varying rhythmic territories. This can be effective for calling attention to synth pads and creating a state of flux or rarity which is otherwise arduous to achieve.\n\n- Turn up the MIX to increase the dry/effect ratio\n- Utilize multiple modulation waveform shapes and sources to alter the rhythmic feel\n- Subtly finesse detuning of delays by using SPREAD\n- Add FEEDBACK to accentuate delays or create infinite loops\n- The Secondary LFO determines how fast the depth and speed modulation “wiggle” their targets\n- Lock the tremolo to tempo using SYNC\n- RETRIG at the top of the waveform for a more predictable effect\n- RIBBON lets you ‘play’ the effect in real-time and provides dynamic and fluid control to morph back and forth between the settings of your choice\n- SLOW/FAST button toggles on a “Slow LFO” mode. Holding it down to “BRAKE” temporarily slows down the LFOs at a constant rate until released\n- Update the tremolo speed in real time using the TAP button\n- Available as an AUv3 plug-in and Standalone App"

Featuring Tony Lakatos (tenor sax), Alex Sipiagin (trumpet), Danny Grissett (piano), Hans Glawischnig (bass), Bruno Castellucci (drums), permitting you to enjoy the full experience and discover all the features the app has to offer.\n\nJazz Master Tracks is dedicated to producing albums aimed at musicians to study and learn jazz. We present top-tier contemporary musicians bringing their decades of experience as bandleaders and top sidemen to the table as they play canonical jazz repertoire. Releasing each session as an “Album in an app” gives these recordings added value, thanks to the generosity of the players, which allows us to participate through an engaging practice tool. Its simple, intuitive, user-friendly stem player interface can benefit all players, whether soloing or comping. What Jazz Master Tracks offers is not simply a backing track, but a real performance with a soul and a direction to work with.\n\nLearning from the masters has always been essential to understanding the language of jazz. Internalizing repertoire, understanding the harmony, listening to the individual players and transcribing the masters is a time-honored way to learn the jazz language.\nBeing able to listen to each instrument in solo mode allows you to hear every detail, every breath. Easy navigation and bookmarks help you learn the phrases by ear — by far the most efficient way. The benefits of transcription cannot be overemphasized: Your ears, technique, and memory are trained simultaneously.\n\nThe app also allows you to interact with the recordings, either as a soloist or as part of the rhythm section. You get the chance to participate in the exciting performance of a great band.\n \nJazz Master Tracks promotes a fair ecosystem honouring the rights of musicians and original composers. By purchasing the Album in an App, you are contributing to a fair musical ecosystem."

      "label": "Chord! is a chord and scale reference that works with any fretted instrument like guitar, basses, ukulele, banjos,… It computes and analyses all the possible fingerings for chords, scales, and arpeggios.\n\nWith Chord!, you can also write a song by simply dragging and dropping chords, transpose it in any key, compute the fingerings with any tuning and generate a beautiful print-ready PDF, etc.\n\nYou can also import your existing songs in text format (please note that the app does not ship with songs). You can also link audio tracks from your music library and play them at the same time while adjusting their pitch and/or speed.\n\nYou don't even have to know music theory to use it: behind its brute force, the app knows how to handle by itself some subtleties of music to give meaningful results.\n\nIf you don't have to be an advanced player to use the app, you can however take a look under the hood and tweak the parameters if you like! Whatever is your level or your instrument, Chord! will adapt and give you the most precise answer.\n\nYou can search for any chord, split (like D/F#), or not. If you're a beginner, you can choose the chord from a list, but you can also use the intelligent keyboard to enter the chord as it is written. If this keyboard is a great way to enter chords, it is also very useful to discover and understand how the chords are formed. You can also enter some notes on a neck to find which chords it can be. You can hear how each fingering sounds. Chord arpeggios are also supported, as well as drop voicings (drop 2, drop3, etc.).\n\nThe app also ships with the biggest list of named scales (and you can create your own scales). It analyses and presents them with nice interactive views (scale, score, and keyboard). Of course, it can also lay down these scales on a neck (with sound) and compute their fingerings. Like for chords, you can even search for a scale from its fingering!\n\nEach scale can be harmonized (decomposed into chords). You can also enter a sequence of chords to find which scale you can use to improvise onto.\n\nYou can use one of the hundred tunings that ship with the app, or you can add your own ones, for any instrument, with or without a capo, even with broken strings if you want!\n\nThe app uses custom and unique algorithms to generate charts, easily input complex harmonic structures, extract chords from fingerings, determine finger positions, compute keys of scales, generate chords from scales and find scales that go well with some chords.\n\nFor example, Chord! is the right tool in these situations:\n• You want to have your songbook available at any time, in your pocket;\n• You're a beginner and you want to know how to play easily a D/F# chord;\n• One gave you a ukulele and you want to know how to tune it and how to play the G Hawaiian scale;\n• You want to know on what scale you can improvise for some chord sequence (and the answer can be different than the Pentatonic minor!);\n• You want to print your song and share it with your band.\n• You want to experiment with this nice open tuning, moreover with a bottleneck;\n• Your little sister can't make bar chords and you want to show her how she can do without bars, with three (little) fingers only;\n• You want to impress your little sister by showing her how you can play the same chords with two bars!\n• You want to understand how this fingering for C13 is actually a fingering for C13;\n• You broke a string and want to know how to play some chords without;\n• You want to know how Django managed to play with two and a half fingers.\n\nThe app fully supports left-handed instruments.\n\nMain functions of the app:\n- Write, transpose, fingerize, print, and share songs;\n- Search chord fingerings (or chord charts);\n- Search chords from fingerings;\n- Search scale fingerings;\n- Search scales from fingerings;\n- Search chords from scale;\n- Search scales from chords."

It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

This instrument featured an advanced vector synthesis system which created new sounds by combining and connecting multiple waveforms; it provided a mix/morphing function that let you use a joystick to change the balance of four oscillators, and a distinctive wave sequence function that allowed you to place waveforms in a desired sequence to create sequence patterns. To this day, it continues to be considered a legendary and still-unique instrument.\n\nNow in 2016, the WAVESTATION has been reborn as \"KORG iWAVESTATION,\" an app for iPad/iPhone. In addition to completely reproducing the programs, it also features a renewed design that lets everyone experience the stupendous sound-shaping potential of the WAVESTATION. It features touch-based operation that's distinctive of iOS, in conjunction with a new graphic interface that allows you to visualize and edit the time-varying timbral changes that are distinctive of the WAVESTATION. \n\n[ Features ]\n\n- A faithful reproduction of the original WAVESTATION sound: In addition to providing the sounds from all PCM memories of the WAVESTATION, the new iWAVESTATION also reproduces in software every detail of the parameters, based on an analysis of the original hardware circuit diagram.\n\n- A new wave sequence view that can be graphically controlled: The iWAVESTATION, we advance another step with a graphical user interface that takes advantage of the touch operations that are a characteristic of iOS. Even more than ever, we've updated the screen design with an emphasis on creating sequences.\n\n- 1,500 sounds, more than 700 waveforms, 55 effects, and a powerful random sequence engine: This new instrument includes a stupendous number of presets and waveforms, covering all models of the series. iWAVESTATION also provides a new random sequence function which will give you different perspectives to inspire new sounds.\n\n- Produce music together with KORG Gadget integration: iWAVESTATION can be used in conjunction with the \"KORG Gadget\" music production DAW app that has won numerous awards around the world. If both apps are installed, it can be used as the \"Milpitas\" gadget inside the KORG Gadget app.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

Extreme Expressivity and Realism delivered in a package of only 46 MB\nThese instruments are NOT sample libraries. Unlike sampling, which uses recordings to replicate the sound of an instrument, physical modeling doesn’t generate a sound as such but creates the conditions for the system to create it according to an external input (like someone playing on a keyboard).\n\nWith our SWAM Tenor Sax for iOS, you now have the unique ability to express yourself with all the emotions  and subtleties of a natural string instrument sound as played by a real player, in any style — from classical to film scoring and even microtonal music.\n\nSWAM Tenor Sax for iOS can be used as a standalone instrument for playing in real-time, or as a plug-in for mobile music production. Play with your favorite external controller or directly from your iOS device through our intuitive interface.\n\nWith SWAM Tenor Sax for iOS you can:\n- Explore our collection of presets, create your own, or import them from your Desktop\n- Play in real-time using the standalone version of the app\n- Play with different instrument bodies\n- Play in a variety of styles like a real player\nControl the instrument’s expressivity in real-time directly through the touch control interface on your iPhone or iPad  including the exclusive virtual bowing touch surface!\n- Play and control the instrument’s expressivity in real-time using your favorite external controller (ROLI Seaboard, Akai EWI, breath controllers, regular keyboards, and more)\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version to produce music with a mobile setup\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version in combination with Camelot PRO for live performances\n- Adjust every aspect of the instrument’s sound (timbre, vibrato, amount of air, etc.) through an easy-to-use control panel\n- Micro-tune the instrument through the Pitch Manager (note: MAQAM device is supported with direct integration)\n- Add built-in effects such as Reverb, EQ, and Compressor\n- Have access to easy MIDI control configurations\n\nThe SWAM Tenor Sax for iOS is for you if:\n- You’re a wind controller player looking for a mobile setup to perform live without needing a computer while still having an incredible sound.\n- You’re a keyboard player and feeling frustrated by the limited expressive capabilities normal sample-based plugins give you.\n- You’re a music producer looking for a mobile setup to produce music from anywhere without having to carry around expensive gear.\n- You’re looking for a virtual instrument that allows you to express the full range of your musicality easily  on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you choose to play using an external controller, please note that a controller with the ability to continuously control the expression (like an expression pedal, breath controller, MPE device, wind controller, …) is REQUIRED. The same way real players need a bow to express themself on their instrument, SWAM Tenor Sax needs something to control its expressivity. SWAM instruments do not work with just note-on velocity."

Unlike sampling, which uses recordings to replicate the sound of an instrument, physical modeling doesn’t generate a sound as such but creates the conditions for the system to create it according to an external input (like someone playing on a keyboard).\n\nWith our SWAM Trumpet for iOS, you now have the unique ability to express yourself with all the emotions  and subtleties of a natural string instrument sound as played by a real player, in any style — from classical to film scoring and even microtonal music.\n\nSWAM Trumpet for iOS can be used as a standalone instrument for playing in real-time, or as a plug-in for mobile music production. Play with your favorite external controller or directly from your iOS device through our intuitive interface.\n\nWith SWAM Trumpet for iOS you can:\n- Explore our collection of presets, create your own, or import them from your Desktop\n- Play in real-time using the standalone version of the app\n- Play with different instrument bodies\n- Play in a variety of styles like a real player\nControl the instrument’s expressivity in real-time directly through the touch control interface on your iPhone or iPad  including the exclusive virtual bowing touch surface!\n- Play and control the instrument’s expressivity in real-time using your favorite external controller (ROLI Seaboard, Akai EWI, breath controllers, regular keyboards, and more)\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version to produce music with a mobile setup\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version in combination with Camelot PRO for live performances\n- Adjust every aspect of the instrument’s sound (timbre, vibrato, amount of air, etc.) through an easy-to-use control panel\n- Micro-tune the instrument through the Pitch Manager (note: MAQAM device is supported with direct integration)\n- Add built-in effects such as Reverb, EQ, and Compressor\n- Have access to easy MIDI control configurations\n\nThe SWAM Trumpet for iOS is for you if:\n- You’re a wind controller player looking for a mobile setup to perform live without needing a computer while still having an incredible sound.\n- You’re a keyboard player and feeling frustrated by the limited expressive capabilities normal sample-based plugins give you.\n- You’re a music producer looking for a mobile setup to produce music from anywhere without having to carry around expensive gear.\n- You’re looking for a virtual instrument that allows you to express the full range of your musicality easily  on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you choose to play using an external controller, please note that a controller with the ability to continuously control the expression (like an expression pedal, breath controller, MPE device, wind controller, …) is REQUIRED. The same way real players need a bow to express themself on their instrument, SWAM Trumpet needs something to control its expressivity. SWAM instruments do not work with just note-on velocity."

      "label": "Songzap is The World’s First Pre-Production App for Songwriters, Musicians, Singers and MCs!\n\nSongzap simplifies drum programming, multitrack recording, song arrangement and mixing, and brings these capabilities literally to a musician’s fingertips. It helps take the guesswork out of song development and enables artists to capture and expand their musical ideas. Songzap focuses on the creative aspects of songcraft and pre-production, helping songwriters to design and interact with beats, experiment with song structures, refine performance approaches, develop and reflect on recordings, and mix a high-quality demo that can be shared with others. You don’t need any technical knowledge to use Songzap – just a passion for making music! \n\nDespite being so simple and intuitive, Songzap is also designed for helping experienced musicians, songwriters and MCs to become more prolific in creating and signing-off songs, harnessing creative inspiration and capturing ideas on the go. So if music is your thing, Songzap is for you!\n\nONE-TIME PURCHASE!\n\nSongzap is a one-time purchase app, there is no recurring subscription charge for using this app. You buy it, you own it. Our goal is to help people make more and better music and we aim to keep our app prices as low as possible to ensure all musicians can benefit!\n\nSongzap is developed by musicians for musicians. You can learn more about the app developers and their creative work, and see examples of the app being put through its paces, over at the Songzap website.\n\nSONGZAP FEATURES\n\n• Capture your vocals and instruments with Songzap’s multi-channel Tracking feature.\n• Use Songzap’s AI-powered Groove Designer for instant, expressive drum programming\n• Structure and finalise your songs with Songzap’s intuitive Arrange tool\n• Get creative and make your songs shine with Songzap’s powerful Mixer engine\n• Export your mixes, MIDI data and individual audio files to share with the world!\n\nFURTHER FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Powerful Drum Notation: allowing you to learn, generate and edit grooves.\n• Original Drum Kits sample library\n• Beat Pattern Presets: start with classic patterns to power your performance and jamming\n• Bounce and Import tracks: for unlimited tracking, jamming, collaboration and layering!\n\nSONGWRITING AND PRE-PRODUCTION\n\nFor many songwriters, singers, MCs, instrumentalists, and musicians there is a discernible gap between ideas (inception) and the route to final production. The professional studio can seem an intimidating place, and the technology used to capture and create recordings impenetrable. We have developed Songzap with the intention of narrowing this gap.\n\nUsing our app you can approach song-making directly, from a variety of tried and tested starting points: by recording your voice and instruments using your phone’s onboard microphone; by putting a groove down first to guide your performance and develop ideas; by experimenting with different song structures and looping sections of a song; and by balancing your recordings and rhythmic elements with intuitive mixer functions. Then, you can export your song to share with the world, or export a folder with all your project assets (full-resolution mix, individual tracks, arrangement markers, lyrics, notes, and drum MIDI data) to bring into the studio for further development. You can also import recordings and bounce down tracks, for unlimited layering!\n\nGET SUPPORT AT THE SONGZAP WEBSITE\n\nThe Songzap website (www.songzap.app) is a one-stop-shop for everything you need to be inspired about music making and getting the best results from Songzap, including:\n\n• Tutorials and extensive videos on all aspects of using Songzap\n• Advice on the art of songwriting and pre-production\n• Demo movie of how Songzap’s developers use the app in creating their own music \n• Blogs and guest articles on songcraft and musical creativity\n\nGet your songs into shape with Songzap!"

Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

      "label": "SynthMaster One iOS is KV331 Audio's first full blown universal synth app on iOS platform. It's a powerful wavetable synth with an intuitive workflow. With its simple layout, rich wavetable/waveform content and inspiring factory presets library, designing new sounds with SynthMaster One iOS is a joy.\n\nSynthMaster One iOS is feature wise identical to the desktop version except the following:\n\n* 16 voice polyphony (32 for the desktop version)\n* Comes with 650 presets (1250 for the desktop version)\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Universal App: SynthMaster One is now a universal standalone/AUv3 synth app running on iPhone 7 and above.\n\n* 650 Factory Presets: SynthMaster One iOS comes with inspiring factory presets from a world class team of sound designers: Arksun, Aiyn Zahev, BigTone Studios, Brian Transeau, Bluffmunkey, Bulent Biyikoglu, Gercek Dorman, Dejavu Sound, Fragment Audio, Kurt Ader, Mirko Ruta, Nori Ubukata, Rob Lee, Ufuk Kevser, Selcuk Ergen, The Machine, Vandalism Sound, Venus Theory, Vorpalsound and Xenos Soundworks\n\n* AUv3: SynthMaster One iOS supports AudioUnits V3, allowing multiple instances to run under supporting DAW apps like GarageBand, Cubasis or Beat Maker. \n\n* Files App Integration: Easily import/export presets, waveforms or scales using the common file browser UI (requires iOS 11+).\n\n* Real-time Modulation Feedback: See in real-time how modulation sources and targets change. This is a very helpful feature when designing sounds!\n\n* Cross Platform Cloud Synchronization: Easily synchronize your SynthMaster One related data across multiple platforms (Windows, MacOS, iPad, iPhone)\n\n* Semi-Modular Architecture: For each SynthMaster One instance, there are 2 oscillators with 2 sub oscillators, 2 Filters,  4 ADSR Envelopes, 3 LFOs, a powerful 16 step arpeggiator/sequencer and also 11 different effects that can be inserted on to 6 FX insert slots. The sub oscillators can be connected to the oscillators in 5 different modes which let you use it as a regular sub oscillator or do complex modulations such as ring modulation, amplitude modulation, phase modulation or frequency modulation.\n\n* 32 Step Arpeggiator/Sequencer: The arpeggiator in SynthMaster One features classic arpeggiator modes such as Up, Down, UpDown, DownUp, UpDown2, DownUp2, AsPlayed as well as Sequence, Chord and Arpeggiate modes. \n\n* Wavetable Synthesis: SynthMaster One implements true wavetable synthesis which opens up new possibilities for sound design. It comes with a rich content library with hundreds of waveforms and wavetables.\n\n* Stereo Oscillators with up to 16 voices Unison: Each of the 2 oscillators in SynthMaster One have stereo output, and can have up to 16 voices \"unison\". Using the \"voices\", \"voices mix\", \"detune curve\", \"detune spread\", \"pan stread\", \"tone spread\" and \"phase spread\" parameters, each oscillator can generate a rich \"supersaw\" type sound.\n\n* Zero Delay Feedback Filters: All of the 4 filter categories in SynthMaster One are developed using the zero delay feedback filter technology. With advanced filter parameters like input gain, drive, acid, filter nonlinearities and up to 4 times oversampling you can get that \"analog\" sound from the filters!\n\n* Rich Set of Effects: SynthMaster One features 11 different effect types: Distortion, LoFi, Ensemble, Phaser, 6 Band EQ, Compressor, Vocoder, Delay, Chorus, Tremolo, Reverb.\n\n* Microtuning: SynthMaster One supports Scala tuning, so tuning can be set either for each preset or globally by loading from a Scala tuning file. SynthMaster One comes with 300+ scales ranging from 5 note equal tempered scales to 12 note alternate tuning scales.\n\n* Preset Browser: SynthMaster One features a comprehensive preset browser with separate search criterias for instrument type, preset attributes, music style or preset author.\n\nSUPPORTS\n\n* All 64-bit iPad devices\n* AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions\n* Note-per-channel MIDI controllers (MPE)\n* Ableton Link\n* Interapp Audio and AudioBus\n* Bluetooth LE MIDI Controllers\n* AirDrop"

      "label": "This is an AUv3 compatible effect plugin which is intended for use inside your favourite DAW such as Cubasis, Auria, Meteor, AUM or GarageBand etc. \n\nThe Vocal Soloist plugin was specifically designed for adding harmonies and basic auto tuning frunctionality to recorded vocal lines. It is specifically tuned to the frequency range of the human voice and tracks the incoming vocal frequency attempting to tune to the desired musical key and mode of your song.\n\nThis effect works in real-time and is able to track a monophonic input creating a convincing harmony at either a specified number of semitones or a key/scale offset. The auto tune allows you to snap to the nearest semitone in chromatic mode, or scale note when a key / mode is selected.\n\nWe have also included our very popular vocal doubler and reverb to give added presence and thickness to your vocal lines.\n\nThe effect includes MIDI control over pitch. If your DAW (such as AUM) supports sending key on/off information to the effect you can directly control the pitch of the harmony. For those DAW's that do not support this you are able to route MIDI from one instance of Vocal Soloist to another instance listening on the same bus. \n\nThe effect also includes controls for defining your own scales as well as controlling vibrato.\n\nFeatures:\n\n○ Real-time processing.\n○ Allows fixed 3rd, 5th, 7th harmonies etc.\n○ Basic Auto-tune (snap to nearest note).\n○ Specify a musical key and mode.\n○ Ability to snap harmonies to selected key.\n○ Built in Vocal Doubler.\n○ Built in Reverb Effect.\n○ MIDI control for harmony note.\n○ Built in MIDI routing.\n\nNote: You can now load this plugin using the internal name 'SoloistFX' or 'HarmonizerFX'."

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store.

      "label": "The ELECTRIBE reborn in an even smaller form A full-fledged rhythm machine for iPhone\n\n● Featured in \"Best Music Apps\"\n● Featured in \"Best New Apps\"\n\nThis app’s intuitive operation allows anyone to easily create powerful beats on the ELECTRIBE series. The enormously popular ELECTRIBE-R instantly became a must-have item for track-makers around the world, and now it’s been reborn as an app for iPhone.\n\nWith this app, we’ve effectively “put the original hardware chassis into your iPhone,” by faithfully reproducing the sound engine and design of the ELECTRIBE-R. We’ve also included the latest preset patterns and many new functions that are currently featured on the “iELECTRIBE for iPad”, released in 2010. , taking a further evolutionary step in technology. Taking advantage of the ease of use that you expect on iPhone, we have maximized the intuitive nature of the ELECTRIBE to make this new product worthy of its name: the iELECTRIBE mkII.\n\nIt won’t take long for you to enjoy the ultimate experience of the Electribe series. This apps intuitive nature and familiar interface make it easy to create beats with an analog feel that’s like nothing else.\n\n● Amazing rhythm machine that generates powerful grooves\nWe’ve perfectly replicated the thick-sounding synth engine of the ELECTRIBE-R and its intuitive step sequencer. Now you can instantly obtain extreme tonal changes and powerful rhythms with just one touch\nNot only can iELECTRIBE for iPhone be easily enjoyed by anyone, but it also allows detailed beat-making that transcends iPhone specs. In addition to playing back the provided audio data, you can also freely synthesize sounds from a single waveform and combine those sounds into your own original beats. This allows for the true experience of music production that connects all musicians.\n\n● Three hundred built-in rhythm patterns that only this app can produce\nWith 64 of the latest preset patterns, 192 from the first-generation ELECTRIBE-R, and 32 template patterns for various genres, this app successfully draws out the full potential of the thick sounding analog beats. There are approximately 300 inimitable rhythm patterns that you’ll hear only from iELECTRIBE for iPhone. Electro, house, techno, drum'n'bass, dubstep, hip hop, techno pop, and IDM are some of the wide range of electronic music genres that are provided.\n\n● An ELECTRIBE that you can put in your pocket and take anywhere\nWhether you’re on the train or bus while commuting to school or to work, at a coffee shop, or in your bedroom, you can enjoy beat-making anywhere and anytime you like. Your completed beats can be transferred to your DAW software via the audio export function. You can also use the WIST function to play wirelessly with a friend using two devices simultaneously.\n\n● Powerful functions that bring infinite possibilities to your grooves\nWe’ve packed maximum potential into this machine with eight types of powerful master effects featured on the upper-level models of the ELECTRIBE. This includes the ring modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R and the cross-modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R mkII. This app allows you to switch back and forth to choose between the two. It also includes the BEAT FLUTTER function that uses a proprietary randomizer to create fresh rhythms and the motion sequence function that remembers your knob movements. In addition, you can use an external USB-MIDI device such as the nanoPAD or nanoKONTROL for performance and control. There’s also support for the latest iOS technologies such as Inter-App Audio, Audiobus, Virtual MIDI, and iCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

      "label": "Spring Reverb models the sound and character of popular spring reverbs found in guitar amplifiers, popularized by Surf, Garage and Rockabilly music. Spring takes this a step further by allowing manipulation of physical parameters not normally available in a real spring tank. The results vary from faithful recreations of real springs to distinctive new sounds that push the physical boundaries of reverb. Guitarists love the revered surfer vibe but all creative musicians will find that Spring makes any synthesizer, drum, or vocal stand out in a mix. \n\nThis vintage reverb sound originally derived from the reflections of sound waves traveling through springs has been given an overhaul for the 21st century and beyond. Eventide Spring contains two different sized ‘spring tanks’ along with the ability to morph between one and three springs. Easily program The Ribbon to seamlessly transition between any two settings in real-time! The added tube-amp-style tremolo can be routed before or after the spring resulting in an unrivaled ability to craft your own unique reverb sound. Alter the intensity by changing the tremolo depth and adjust the tremolo rate in Hz, or note value when tempo-synced to your project.\n\nFeatures:\n- Artist presets by Matt Lange, Nick Hook, and Nu-Trix.\n- Tempo Sync reverb decay to your DAW\n- Craft original sounds by changing the number of springs and damping frequency\n- Alter overall resonance by selecting the size of the spring tank \n- Tube-amp-style tremolo that can be routed pre- or post-reverb\n- Create chorus-like effects by altering Modulation Level\n- The Ribbon controller allows for dynamic modification of several knobs at once to easily morph between settings\n- Programmable Hotswitch provides the ability to jump instantly to an alternate sound at the push of a button\n- iOS version works as a standalone app, AudioUnit v3 effect, or Inter-App Audio effect"

      "label": "XAir Monitor Mixer is a personal monitor mixer for select Behringer and Midas digital mixers. It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

      "label": "NanoStudio 2 is a powerful music production environment for synthesis, sampling, arranging, editing and mixing. It’s the successor to the original NanoStudio, an app held in high regard by musicians for many years for its usability, quality and productivity.  \n\nNanoStudio 2 builds upon the same design principles as its predecessor and introduces a huge range of extra features.  An all-new audio engine delivers truly professional sound quality, highly optimized to handle complex projects with large numbers of instruments and effects.\n\nNanoStudio 2 hosts external Audio Unit (AUv3) instruments and audio/MIDI effects.  A library of all your AU instruments and presets is maintained so they’re tagged, searchable and just as accessible as NanoStudio’s own internal instruments.\n\nObsidian is NanoStudio’s built-in synth.  It has 3 oscillators with 32 note polyphony and 7 different synthesis methods including analogue, wavetable, FM, multi-saw and phase distortion.  It also supports samples and multisamples which may be split by note or velocity. Obsidian has 18 different filter types, including resonant analogue, super clean digital, formant, comb and waveshaping. Nearly every parameter can be modulated via the synth’s 5 envelopes, 5 LFOs and 10 configurable macro controllers, and modulation connections can be assigned with just a few taps.  300 factory patches are supplied with macros set up and ready to go.  It’s easy to create your own patches and there are many more professionally produced patches available as IAP.\n\nSlate is NanoStudio’s second built-in instrument, a sample/synthesis-based performance pad which makes it easy to tap out drum beats.  Slate comes with 500 quality factory samples ranging from multisampled acoustic drums with natural variations through to cutting-edge electronic percussion and effects. 50 factory kits are include, and it’s easy to construct your own drum kits using the factory samples or your own. Slate can also be used with samples of just about anything: vocals, guitar riffs, synth pads – you name it.\n\nThere are powerful editors for song arrangement, MIDI, automation and samples.  All share a consistent user interface so you’ll be up to speed with them and making music in no time.\n\nA fully-featured sequencer supports tempo and time signature tracks (including tempo ramps) and Ableton Link.\n\nEverything’s brought together by a mixer with unlimited tracks, track grouping and audio/MIDI sends.  Tracks may have an unlimited number of insert effects with 11 built-in effects to choose from including reverb, sidechain compressor/expander, EQ with spectrum analysis, look-ahead limiter, delay, exciter, chorus, flanger and phaser.  You can add AU audio/MIDI effects to the chain and use them just like an internal effect.\n\nThere are many mixdown options available with quality settings up to 32 bit/96kHz and support for file formats including wav, aiff, ogg and M4A.  You can mixdown track stems in a single operation or select just a region of the song - great for resampling.\n\nNanoStudio supports Audiobus and has many options for file sharing via the iOS Files app, Dropbox, AudioShare, iTunes File Sharing, AirDrop, email, WebDAV and importing music from your iTunes library.\n\nDevelop your initial musical ideas through to a final master with an intuitive workflow designed to get things done."

      "label": "WOOTT is an Audio Unit plugin (AUv3 audio effect) inspired by the infamous OTT sound. \n\nWOOTT uses a triple band dynamics algorithm with simultaneous downwards AND upwards compression, and adds a dedicated limiter to each band. So what's all that techno mumbojumbo good for?\n\n1. First, it slams all the loud, dominant aspects of your sound\n2. Next it blows up all the subtle quiet bits that were hiding below\n\nAs a result, it's perfect for:\n- Blowing up average sounds to massive proportions\n- Giving an aggressive sharp edge to synthesizer filters\n- Bringing out subtle details and movement that would otherwise get lost in the mix (in a hamfisted way, though)\n- Dusting off old breakbeat samples and loops\n- Hyping specific aspects of your synth lines\n- Making generally boring things more interesting\n\nWOOTT features:\n- AUv3 audio unit effect plugin\n- Universal (all iPads and iPhones supported), iOS11+\n- Runs in all your favorite plugin hosts: Cubasis, AUM, Beatmaker 3, Nanostudio 2, Garageband, etc.\n- Multi-output (requires compatible host) for post-processing the individual bands\n- Low-resource, so stack as many of them as you like - \"[WO]OTT all the things!\"\n- Downwards *and* upwards compressors (a rare feature on conventional dynamics plugins)\n- Smart soft limiter per band, adapts to its own band's specific settings\n- Mono switch makes low-band signal monaural for an extra tight bass\n\nNote: this is not a subtle effect. If subtle and minimal are what you're after, this is not the droid you're looking for :-)\n\nUser manual on ruismaker.com"

      "label": "Helium is a lightweight AUv3 MIDI sequencer plugin designed specifically for AUM. It supports up to 16 tracks of unlimited length with the ability to direct output to 16 channels on up to 16 MIDI output ports.\n\nOne of the great features is the ability to import and maintain libraries of MIDI clips using Helium's 'Media Bay'. These clips are freely available all over the internet and may contain individual chord sets, chord progressions or drum tracks. You can quickly build a song by dragging and dropping your MIDI clips from the media bay onto your timeline. You can also save your own clips directly to the media bay to create your own personal MIDI clips libraries. Long press on a clip to preview its contents using the currently selected MIDI device.\n\nHelium now ships with a library of over 7000 MIDI clips, consisting of every chord and chord progression you could ever need.\n\nHelium allows many different ways to import additional MIDI clip libraries. Simply drag and drop your ZIP collections directly to your PC/MAC web browser and they are automatically unpacked into the clips library folder. You can also drag and drop files between the Media Bay and the iOS Files app.\n\nHelium supports a sync mode called 'Remote Looping'. This was something we recently introduced into our MultiTrack Recorder plugin and is very useful for breaking down the timeline into sections.  You can define up to 12 loops which can be used to specify the locations of say the intro, verse, chorus, and outro within your song, then trigger these loops seemlessly in sync with the host tempo. Once captured, these loops can then be triggered by incoming MIDI notes.\n\nA new addition to Helium is the ability to piece together loops into songs, so you just concentrate on creating a single verse, chorus, bridge etc. and piece everything together without the headache of having to re-arrange your timeline.\n\nFeatures\n\n○ 16 Tracks per instance.\n○ Includes a library of over 7000 MIDI clips.\n○ Assignable MIDI channel and Bus per track.\n○ Full editing of CC controllers using the controller lane.\n○ Independent vertical and horizontal zooming.\n○ Import & Export MIDI tracks.\n○ Media Bay, organize your MIDI flips libraries.\n○ Clip Preview from Media Bay\n○ Drag and Drop from the Media Bay directly to the timeline.\n○ Drag and Drop to Files App.\n○ Remote Control with Looping advanced functionality.\n○ Step Recording.\n○ Build in Mixer to adjust relative track levels with Mute/Solo.\n○ Sync to Host.\n○ Up to 16 outputs (configurable).\n○ MIDI Clip Preview\n○ Ghost Note Feature\n○ Multi level undo and redo.\n○ Song Mode\n○ Multi-Take Record\n\nPlease checkout the help manual for details on where to find my tutorial videos on Helium and where to download some fully featured and free MIDI clip libraries.\n\nThis is not recommended to use on small iPhone screen sizes such as the SE models. You can adjust the screen scaling to suite your iPhone model by long pressing the MENU button and changing the scale."

      "label": "Drambo is an innovative modular groovebox and audio processing environment. Modular components are used to build synthesized and sample based instruments or audio effects using high-quality DSP and audio-rate modulation. Tied to a powerful sequencer, it’s an optimal music creation tool for sound design, composition, performance and experimentation.\n\nAt the heart of Drambo lies an entirely new concept that makes modular creations easy, fun and affordable. Modules are connected automatically, with no cables as you add or rearrange them. A dynamic interface creates modulation knobs when you need them. Modules may house other modules, so you can keep your patch well organized. Of course, automatic connections can be overridden. In Drambo you can focus on playing with sound and signal structure without getting lost in wires.\n\nUse a deep and innovative sequencer to compose patterns and whole tracks, for production or live performance. Go beyond simple looping sequences with parameter locking, conditional step components, parameters automation and powerful scene morphing. Drambo works equally well as a self-contained standalone app or audio unit plugin with audio and MIDI connectivity as an AUV3 instrument, audio effect and MIDI effect. No modular experience necessary to get started playing with preset sounds and effects.\n\nYou can use Drambo as\n\n• A complete music production and performance environment\n\n• Endless modular playground, that allows you to build, modify and store custom instruments and effects. For instance: build a custom synth, sample and resample, build a Theremin using a gyroscope module, or turn your table into a playable surface, by processing microphone input with physical modelling modules. Get weird or make functional instruments and tools.\n\n• MIDI sequencer, that works with hardware and AUv3 instruments (e.g. Drambo sequences other instruments in an AU host app). Moreover Drambo can generate custom MIDI CC messages or modulation signals to control modular synths via DC coupled interfaces.\n\n• AUv3 synthesizer, effect or sequencer in other DAWs. Drambo can replace a lot of audio plugins. For instance: you may use it as a chorus, phaser, reverb, filter, equalizer, complex modular delay, decimator, frequency shifter, MIDI effect or complex modulator for other synths. You may combine, modulate and sequence them in no time.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Polyphonic, stereo processing and audio-rate modulation. All signals are equal. Up to 8 voices per modular instrument rack.\n\n• Unique modular concept: cable-less, drag'n'drop, color coding dynamic interface, automatic connections, and customizable compact, rack views.\n \n• Directional flow makes Drambo routing and patching straightforward. Signal flows only left to right, so there are no instant feedback routings in Drambo. Delayed feedback is possible using certain modules.\n \n• Simple and clean interface, that scales to every size and device orientation\n  \n• Custom modular racks that can be nested, with presets at the track, rack, and module level.\n\n• Clip launcher / song arrager. \n\n• 16-tracks, polyphonic sequencer with parameter locks, automation and step components. 8 dedicated step sequence editor types, piano-roll, powerful automation designer with drawing modes and cubic Bezier curves.\n\n• Audio Units hosting ( standalone app only )\n\n• Over 120 modules available, such as: oscillators, samplers, physical modelling modules, LFOs, envelope generators, filters, audio effects, mixers, MIDI processors, sequencers and math functions.\n\n• Morph groups: you can morph many parameters using a single slider.\n\n• Available as a standalone app, AUv3 instrument, effect and MIDI effect.\n\n• MIDI, MPE and Ableton Link support\n\nWith Drambo, you are in charge. Create the music from your vision to reality.\n\n\"Drambo changes the face of iOS music apps.\" Cult of Mac\n\nVisit https://patchstorage.com/platform/drambo/ for community content."

      "label": "Thick basses, buttery leads, feathery pads — Trooper is a total synth explosion that crams it all and more in a neat little package. It sounds HUGE, yet tweaks easy. It’s coated in analog “fat,” yet bursts with tonal surprises nestled across its controls. Get ready for an all-out sonic assault, because Trooper is here and it's our meanest, beastliest, user-friendliest synth yet!\n\nMany of Trooper’s parameters are meant to interact and meld together in novel ways. For example, the oscillator volumes —beyond just acting as mere blend knobs— vary the characteristics of the basic signal depending on how far they are “pushed\". The emphasis is on providing warm and round basic tones with lots of variable harmonic content.\n\nThe primary oscillators are backed by an audible LFO that is both a sound source and a wide frequency range modulator. This lets FM-based sounds to combine with traditional waveforms. A pink/white noise generator helps out pads and percussions, and insidiously changes tonality when added in small amounts.\n\nA new filter implementation complements the pugnacity of the signal generators. In its middish settings, the resonance can be characterized as “throaty.” The filter is capable of self-oscillating, and can be controlled via the keyboard. The mated ADSR envelope is shaped to provide tonal ‘immediacy’ and smooth frequency shifts. The amount knob has a wide range that changes the feel and shape of the envelope, especially when pushed above the mid-level.\n\nThe output stage features a virtual VCA that imparts tones colloquially termed as “fat”. Extra modulation is provided by a non-audible LFO and a dedicated envelope. The LFO offers numerous wave shapes, BPM syncing, and key tracking. Its output is controllable via the mod wheel, velocity, or aftertouch. \n\nThe Esprit parameter helps deploy some of the Trooper “special sauce.” Highly interactive with the stages preceding it, Esprit is known to be handy in tightening up bass tones, and in adding the \"je nais se quois” to presets at large. The Get6 parameter is a one-touch ticket to big, mix-filling synth sounds. So whenever you’re lost in an empty mix…it’s got your six.  \n\nThe arpeggiator inspires rhythms with five algorithms, variable note value, octave range, and gate. The “Texturizer\" purveys a wide range of modulation effects that include chorus, flanging, variable comb, resonant delay, and stereo imaging. The BPM-syncable two-tap delay has time and feedback controls per channel, and is tuned a little darker than our usual offerings. Trooper can run in monophonic or polyphonic mode, the latter providing up to 12 voices. Legato is available in either mode. \n\nThe robust MIDI implementation also includes MPE support, and the synth is able to I/O MIDI performance data. The “MagTouch” virtual controller lets you to play and record (in AUv3 hosts so enabled) over the MPE protocol. MIDI learn is made easy via a visual interface, and users can save, patch-link, and share MIDI CC maps. Bluetooth MIDI input is also supported.\n\nThe AUv3 implementation lets you to run multiple instances of Trooper in DAWs. Trooper’s fluid UI accommodates a wide variety of screen sizes and view configurations. Feature navigation is designed to be nonintrusive so that parameters can be accessed easily. The iPad implementation supports portrait layout, so that pretty much all is on one screen.\n\nIncluded are over 250 presets that range from deep basses to weird so-and-so's, stopping by many other sounds along the way. The powerful YPAT2 system helps you save, catalog, and share presets with ease.\n\nThe standalone app provides a “Tapedeck” to record, save, and share your ideas on the quick. It features a built-in looper, and a metronome with configurable time signature. The standalone also features tap tempo, and MIDI clock syncing. DSP is in high resolution 64-bit, with native processing at up to 96kHz."

Import your own sounds via AirDrop or the Files app, or record sounds directly with your device's microphone or a connected iOS interface. As soon as you record a sound it’s available to be played on drum pads as well as being mapped across a keyboard. Sounds can be subtly shaped or entirely transformed using the built-in effects and easy-to-use editing tools.\n\nYou can record a quantized or unquantized performance on the pads or keyboard. There is also a full piano roll where you can enter and edit notes and velocities.\n\nRecord knob movements or draw automation by hand to bring even more life to your sounds. Every automation lane can also have its own independent length, for polymetric and generative music possibilities.\n\nCreate up to 16 different sections for your song and drag and drop them into any order to create your arrangement.\n\nMixing and mastering tools allow you to finish a full track without ever leaving your phone. You can export your full track, or hit the tape icon and record the live output of the app while you tweak anything on the fly. Both options allow you to capture individual track stems as well!\n\nA performance page lets you trigger your patterns live while controlling a global filter, assignable pitch bends and reverb sends, and a random fill generator.\n\nArtist packs are available in-app at $3.99 or less, which include original sounds and projects from Andrew Huang, Cuckoo, Chuck Sutton, Kilamanzego, Pusher, and more on the way all the time.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 9 track sampler\n- 4 effects per track: Delay, Filter, Chorus, Bitcrush\n- Graphic EQ per track\n- Monophonic or up to 16-note polyphonic playback per sample\n- Adjustable pitch, volume, playback direction, sample start and stop points\n- 19 automatable parameters per track\n- Independent lengths for each automation lane\n- Automation can be recorded via knob movements or drawn by hand\n- Drum pad and keyboard input\n- Full piano roll with 10 octaves, note velocity, editing tools\n- Randomization over sample selection for quick inspiration\n- Randomization over note position to create surprising variations\n- Drag-and-drop song arrangement page\n- Global reverb with individual track sends\n- Mixing and mastering tools\n- Powerful performance features for creating instant fills, pitch shifts, reverb sends, and global low or high pass filtering\n- Export full track and stems\n- Live recording of performances\n- Metronome with tap tempo and swing/shuffle\n- Ableton Link integration for easy syncing with other devices over WiFi \n- Share projects and sounds via AirDrop, email, etc.\n- Undo and redo"

      "label": "EōN is a new relationship to \"recorded\" music as we have always known it by immersing the listener in an endless sound (and visual) experience, like an album whose duration would have no fixed limit.\n\nEōN produces an infinite music, in constant evolution, abundant in variations, composed by electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre, accompanied by a constant progression of organic visual elements.\n\nOnce the EōN app is activated, you will listen and watch a new unlimited music experience constantly unfold, designed to be absolutely unique for each listener, always different each time the app is launched.\n\nYou can enjoy a different journey everytime, listening as many times and as long as you want, the only limit being your device’s battery!\n\nIn addition, once downloaded, EōN is fully autonomous requiring no internet connection. Thus it is possible to launch the app anywhere and at any time.\n\nJEAN-MICHEL JARRE ABOUT EōN:\n  \"-Eon- the name of an ancient Greek God associated with unlimited time and eternity.\n\nI named this project EōN as it symbolizes exactly what it is: an infinite musical and visual creation, which offers to everyone a unique experience, which will never happen again: on each device and each activation of the application EōN, you will hear and see an ever-evolving orchestration of music and visuals. EōN is an endless organic work, never repetitive, that will live and grow indefinitely at your fingertip.\n\nLike in life, every moment lived in EōN will never happen again.\n\nPersonally, I truly feel that EōN is probably one of my most exciting creative projects since Oxygene. I always wanted to create a specific music for each listener, able to evolve constantly in terms of rhythms, tones, tempo, melodies and textures. Here it is. EōN is conceived and composed as a different journey for everyone, with no end determined.\n\nI had a clear idea of the organic, living visuals I wanted to accompany my music, and I was very lucky to spend some time in Tokyo at Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL), where I discovered Alexis André and his singular visual world. Sony CSL with Alexis have conceived and developed an algorithm generating an endless flow of ever-evolving graphics, which, like the music, are infinite and never repeatitive.\n\nThe algorithm and audio engine that orchestrates the music of the EōN app have been engineered by Alexis Zbik & Vianney Apreleff from BLEASS after defining the rules of the system together. \"\n\n\nCREDITS\nConceived and composed by Jean-Michel Jarre\nDigital Graphics by Alexis André of Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc.

You can combine and rearrange these bars arbitrarily and edit them in piano roll. Tempo is chosen automatically, however it can be simply changed as well as key. All notes are picked by the algorithm. Currently you can choose from default rap, lo-fi, chiptune, cinematic or dance styles. Each of these styles brings unique music experience. You can also activate chord progression builder to define exactly what chords will Beatly use in the generated bars or create your own bar patterns which will be consequently used by the algorithm when building a new track. To modify already generated chord progression in the track you can change key/base chord of each beat within a bar. All notes of given beat will be transposed appropriately.\n\nRun app, tap the play button. It is that simple. Music will be different each time you hit the reload button. Once you're done editing the tune, simply save it for later, export to MIDI or record your live session to WAV audio file. You can even render separated stems or seamless loop of your entire track. You can also hook up Beatly with your favorite mixer using MIDI output.\n\nDrums too loud? Adjust the volume. Synth annoying? Mute it or try other built-in sounds. Loving the sound of piano? Solo it and make it shine. Mixer got your back! Need variation? Reload any instrument part of your track. Generated part not to your liking? Leverage the piano roll to fix algorithm's mistakes and make it awesome!\n\nCan I import my own samples?\n\nYes! You can attach or record your very own WAV or M4A sound to any instrument track. Just bear in mind, samples tuned in C will sound best! :)\n\nIf you like Beatly Pro, please, support us by rating this app in the App Store or donating via in-app purchase.\nIf you have any idea how to improve Beatly Pro, please, leave us a message! Thank you!"

      "label": "The Minimoog Model D App is a software transmutation of the world’s first portable synthesizer, the Minimoog Model D®. Anyone can jump in and play with over 160 included presets or lay fingers to the controls and begin exploring vast magical realms of creative potential for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and Mac. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App incorporates a number of inspiring sound creation tools and capabilities not present on its analog antecedent. New functions include the ability to play chords with up to four-note polyphony, an easy-to-use arpeggiator for rhythmic pattern creation, a real time looping recorder with unlimited overdubbing capacity, a tempo-synchronizable stereo ping pong delay module, and the Bender -- a wide-range stereo time modulation effect module. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App also supports AUv3 Audio Unit extensions, which allows multiple instances of this powerful instrument to be used simultaneously within compatible iOS apps supporting AUv3.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY \nIntroduced by Moog in 1970, the Minimoog Model D served as the archetype for all electronic keyboards that followed. It gave users the ability to design their own sounds, translating imagination into reality. The Minimoog’s portability, affordability and accessibility made it the go-to instrument for musicians looking to expand beyond the traditional sounds of the time. Bernie Worrell used the Minimoog Model D to establish Parliament Funkadelic’s futuristic funk sound. Kraftwerk employed the Minimoog Model D on the successful concept album Autobahn, sparking an entirely new genre. Gary Numan replaced his live band’s guitars with Minimoog Model Ds, creating the prototype for industrial music. The classic sound of the Minimoog Model D can be heard on Bob Marley’s Catch A Fire, Michael Jackson’s Thriller and Dr. Dre’s The Chronic; Detailed in the mini-doc series “A Brief History Of The Minimoog”. \n\nFEATURES \n• Ships with over 160 presets (hundreds more available in the Minimoog Model D App Store) \n• Up to 4-notes of polyphony \n• Easily share presets and audio recordings with friends \n• Arpeggiator module with note-hold and chord latch capability \n• Stereo ping-pong delay effect \n• Bender time modulation effect \n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing \n• Selectable envelope shapes and triggering behavior \n• Effortless MIDI CC mapping \n• Seamlessly backup presets to iCloud \n• Play mode for easier panel and keyboard interaction \n• A new take on the classic feedback/overload path \n\nSUPPORTS\n• All 64-bit iOS devices\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions (Including GarageBand)\n• MPE Controller Support \n• Ableton Link \n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI \n• MIDI Program Change Support \n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers \n• Share over AirDrop, Mail, or other iOS applications"

      "label": "Unfiltered Audio's Needlepoint is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nUnfiltered Audio raises the bar (and lowers the tonearm) with Needlepoint: a revolution in vinyl simulation. Continuing the retro themes of their smashed-up hit lo-fi-af, Needlepoint presents a full platter of advanced physical modeling to dive deep into the warm, fuzzy sound of turntable noises and artifacts beloved by many. Of course, since this is an Unfiltered Audio plugin, you can push the needle far past realism and dive into some seriously warped sounds.\n\nWhile many vinyl plugins are content to use looping samples of noise, Needlepoint uses physical modeling to achieve its incredible sound. Needlepoint synthesizes all sorts and sizes of detritus and distress on a record: hair, dust mites, scratches, warping, etc. These are not randomly modeled, but rather accurately distributed onto a rotating, algorithmic platter. Changing the speed of the record can greatly change the nature of Needlepoint's impact on your sound. While you may be used to vinyl RPMs like 33 1/3, 45, and 78, have you ever wondered what it would sound like to tempo sync a turntable to your DAW? Now you can!\n\nBeyond noise, ambience, and tone, Needlepoint includes other effects to fully etch out your vibe. A single knob compressor (inspired by lo-fi-af's PRESS knob with six additional algorithms) can be added before or after the signal chain. This compressor can emulate algorithms from famous hardware samplers associated with vinyl, or even mimic the sound of analog distortion introduced by the vinyl pressing process. A BROKEN mode emulates a broken record a broken record a broken record a broken... Where were we? Oh right, a BROKEN mode acts as an unpredictable looper by jumping the grooves on your recent audio. You can automate the mode's toggle to create all sorts of cut-up and glitchy phrases.\n\nNo vinyl plugin would be complete without a SPINDOWN button that creates that classic vinyl stop (and start!) sound. Here you can control the rate of the spindown to better fit the effect into your mixes. Finally, at the end of the processing chain, Needlepoint features a granular pitch shifter to help you achieve that chopped up vibe without needing to manually change the speed of your tracks.\n\nDespite all of these features, Needlepoint is incredibly easy to use. With a beautiful interface and an extensive set of presets, Needlepoint will help you itch that nostalgic scratch that your tracks need.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Needlepoint has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Needlepoint can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with Needlepoint will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

With this section alone, you can place your sound into an entirely different space.\n\nThe Spectral section then splits your sound into thousands of frequencies before reconstructing it with a twist. Here you can reproduce the sound of a pirated MP3 or pitch shift your signal with clean perfection.\n\nYour signal then takes a trip through the digital section. All sorts of hazards are present here, from a skipping CD stutter effect to a multimode bitcrusher.\n\nFinally, the rich, colorful analog section adds that vibe that you crave. A maximizer, a tape saturator, a noise generator, an analog-style filter, a pitch warbler, and a radio demodulator all work together in harmony to toss your sound into the past.\n\nBut wait! That's only one possible signal chain. The Convolution, Spectral, Digital, and Analog sections can be completely rearranged in any order. Dozens of presets will get your started on your sound warping adventure.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, lo-fi-af has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more!

      "label": "Co-designed with Berlin-based electronic musician Hainbach, Gauss brings the oldschool tape-looping art form to mobile devices. This creative field looper works both standalone and as an Audio Unit effect plugin and puts the possibilities of using looped tapes in your hands. Without the need for scissors.\n\nLike real tape loops Gauss takes you off the grid of your DAW: you can adjust tape speed and direction, even during recording. The flow of your loops will drift organically as the tape follows its own cyclical timeline. \n\nUse overdub, or even multiple instances of the Audio Unit plugin, to create multi-layered ever changing sonic palettes. \n\nWe want this app to be a celebration of digital audio technology, so when audio quality is degraded it will do so in a pleasingly crunchy digital way. For example, recording on low tape speeds will give you longer recording time, but at the cost (or pleasure) of a distinctively lower recording quality. So Gauss mimics the behaviour - not the sound - of magnetic tape.\n\nSet the length of the tape, record and overdub your audio, play around with tape speeds; Gauss captures the essence of two ends of tape stuck together in all its unsynchronised, free-running glory. There's even a unique built-in 4-step polyrhythmic sequencer for sequencing tape-speed changes.\n\n- designed as a standalone field recorder and an Audio Unit effect plugin (AUv3) in one package\n- universal app: plugin and standalone work on all iDevices, iOS11 and higher\n- variable tape speed; seamlessly change direction and speed during playback or recording\n- 4-step sequencer lets you trigger (polyrhythmic) tape-speed changes in sync with your host tempo\n- variable inertia for the tape drive motors (from instant to very slow speed changes) \n- built-in multi-mode filter with LFO modulation\n- delay effect with optional host-sync mode\n- “1989” mode uses a special 8 bit/11KHz tape head for a last-century vintage digital sound\n- 45 seconds maximum loop size at 1x speed, proportionally longer at lower speeds (.e.g 90 seconds at half speed, etc.)\n- overdub at any speed or tape direction\n- plugin supports global cross-host preset handling (requires iOS13+, compatible AUv3 host)\n\nFind the user manual at ruismaker.com"

      "label": "Do not buy this app unless you are a professional piano technician.  This is a professional tool that produces a custom piano tuning for any piano.  It is part of the TuneLab line of piano tuning programs for smartphones, tablet computers and laptops that piano technicians have been using sine 2001.\r\n\r\nNotable features:\r\n\r\n* Capable of an accuracy to 0.02 cents.\r\n* Measures and uses inharmonicity of the piano to construct a custom tuning.\r\n* Provides an over-pull mode for more accurate pitch-raises.\r\n* Can store hundreds of tuning files for individual pianos.\r\n* Tuning files can be stored locally and in the Cloud on Dropbox. \r\n* Provides many historical temperaments for period music.\r\n* Switches notes automatically when you play the next note.\r\n* Provides a strobe-like Phase Display for fine-tuning.\r\n* Provides a versatile frequency spectrum display.\r\n\r\nTuneLab lets you customize a tuning by sampling the inharmonicity for a few notes of the particular piano.  You can choose the kind of tuning stretch you want by specifying different intervals for the bass, the treble, and the mid-range of the scale.  These intervals can be octaves, 12ths, double octaves, etc.  Good defaults are in place if you are not sure which settings you prefer.\r\n\r\nAfter a custom tuning has been created from inharmonicity measurements you can store this tuning by name.  The next time you need to tune that piano, or one very much like it, you simply load that same tuning file and start tuning.  There is essentially no limit to the number of tuning files that you can store.  TuneLab comes with some sample tuning files and an \"Average\" tuning file so you can start tuning right away without bothering to measure inharmonicity.\r\n\r\nTuneLab covers the normal piano range from A0 to C8 (88 notes).  The automatic note-switching feature makes it possible to enjoy hands-free operation.  There is also easy one-touch manual note switching.\r\n\r\nTuneLab has two different displays that are visible at the same time.  One is the strobe-like Phase Display.  This is a band where black squares move left or right depending on whether the note is sharp or flat. Tune the note to make the pattern stop moving. The other is the Spectrum Display.  This is a graph of the frequency spectrum around the desired note that shows a peak in the audio frequency spectrum for every pitch present in the sound.  The object in using this display is to tune the note until the peak in the graph is positioned at a central red line.  The Spectrum Display makes it possible to do a rough pitch-raise without mutes since each string of a unison produces its own peak in the graph.  Having both the Phase Display and the Spectrum Display visible at the same time gives you a more complete picture of the tuning than any single spinner-type or needle-type display."

Emphasize your basslines working with waveshaper’s sections blend and color, or increasing the clip’s value (this works great also on drums and acoustic percussive sounds). Blow digital coldness to your synths going wild with S&M and Bits&Samps functions, or increasing wrap or fold values . Add unpredictable dynamic glitches thanks the exclusive gate. Shaper is your digital edge!\n\nShaper 2 is composed by several modules, that you can rearrange as you want:\n- a glitch gate, now with a Smooth parameter\n- a waveshaper with 5 inspiring functions: Muffin, Multistress, Cracker, S&M, Bits&Samps\n- a transform module with Clip, Wrap, Fold, and sFold functions\n- a resonator/short delay, that can act as a comb filter too\n- a lopass/hipass filter lets adjust the processed sound\n\nMODULAR STRUCTURE\nDrag and reorder modules as you prefer and create different chains for different needs.\n\nGRAPHICS\nBeyond classic oscilloscope, two displays show the exact function you are using to process incoming sounds.\n\nI/O\nYou choose how to feed Shaper 2 and how to mix it with Gain and Mix parameters.\n\nGO BY FEEL / PRECISE EDITING\nAs part of encouraging more musical and creative applications of Shaper 2, in addition to using symbols for controls, the controls in Shaper 2 do not have individual readouts.

      "label": "Steel Guitar PRO is a highly advanced guitar processor that combines cutting-edge realtime audio generation with a truly expressive control interface. It provides many unique guitar models, built-in amps & FX processing, MIDI control, AUv3, and wide-ranging customizability.\n\n:: Control Surface ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO features a powerful yet familiar control interface. Simply touch the strings to “pick,” and drag the slide bar to modulate pitch. By enabling enhanced slide control, you can even use multiple touches to tilt the slide bar, or dampen the strings. Fretboard dimension, string spacing, and pick guard size are all configurable. A high level of resolution enables minute pitch control and realistic vibrato. Settings let you vary guitar tone, sustain and release times, touch behavior, slide bar auxiliary control, handedness, and more.\n\n:: Guitars ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO provides you with an arsenal of guitars to choose from: unique examples of humbuckers, single coils, P90s, and more. Instruments include many 6 string guitars, as well as 8- and 10-string steel guitar variants. Each family of instruments comes with many tuning to choose from, but you can also create and save your own. In addition, you have up to seven virtual “pedals” to bend individual or collections of string — much like a pedal steel. The pedals can be actuated by slightly tilting the device, or via MIDI, or even with the fretting touch. All of this is configurable by the user.\n\n:: Built-In FX Processing ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO incorporates a virtual signal chain where you can put amps and FX in any combination. The included dozen amps and 20 FX are all custom tuned to evoke the best tones from the guitar processor. Each amp or effect features multiple parameters to precisely modify its tone and feel. These parameters are MIDI-mappable, so that you can control them via an external device. The amp collection covers a broad spectrum from bell-like cleans to thick overdrive. The FX include many analog inspired “pedals” that range from overdrives, distortions, mods, delays, reverbs, to beyond.\n\n:: AUv3 & MIDI ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO can also be used as an AUv3 MIDI plugin. We developed a custom MIDI sub-protocol so that Steel Guitar PRO and its powerful control interface can run seamlessly inside an AUv3 host. You can also use a traditional MIDI keyboard or device to play Steel Guitar PRO, which readily accommodates MIDI pitch & mod wheels, and key velocity as well. \n\n:: Useful Features ::\n\nSteel Guitar PRO includes a comprehensive preset management system that allows you to save, modify, and share any number of your “rigs.” The standalone app also includes a handy “tape deck” where you can record, play, loop and import/export audio. MIDI learn feature is easy and intuitive to use, but also offers deeper customization. All audio processing is done in the highest resolution, natively and without resampling at rates up to 96kHz. The fluid user interface integrates readily with many different AUv3 hosts."

      "label": "Bit Maestro is an AUv3 bit crusher that goes beyond regular bit rate reduction, allowing you to affect and manipulate your sound at the individual bit level. Taking inspiration from the legendary ‘OTO Biscuit’ it enables you to selectively mute or invert individual bits in your audio signal. As it does this it creates distortions in your waveform, introducing a wide range of harmonics. Bit Maestro pushes this concept even further, allowing you for the first time to even rearrange the order in which the bits are evaluated, reassigning their value and giving rise to waveform distortions not previously seen in any distortion module.\n\nThis sound can be further enhanced in a number of ways. \n- Three filters are available (low pass, low shelf, high shelf) which can be used to tame or enhance the aggressiveness of the sound.\n- A delay line to inject a different groove into a bar or provide a basis for interesting mod effects.\n- A modulation panel to continually evolve your sound and introduce further aliasing effects.\n\nThe end result is a plugin that can introduce huge depth and power to your sound. One that offers you the nuanced control to design your perfect digital distortion, ranging from subtle warbling to huge crushing sounds that can transform any drum or bass line. \n\nSupports:\n- AUv3\n- MIDI control\n- Inter-app Audio\n- Audiobus"

    "summary": {
      "label": "SENODE is an innovative music app based on the idea of finite state machines. It works like a polyphonic modular step sequencer with probabilistic steps. This app is perfect for generative music and complex sequencing setups. Senode syncronizes its clock to Ableton Link or integrates as AUv3 plugin. All actions are MIDI bindable, so the steps can be triggered in real time from drum pads, sensors or other apps – a real live-performance instrument!\n\n\"Senode is something quite different when it comes to sequencing\" - Create Digital Music\n\n\"I highly recommend Senode to everyone who is interested in generative music. It's such a fun app to work with!\" - haQ attaQ\n\n\"A Killer App!\" - A4iRebirth\n\n\nCREATE COMPLEX SEQUENCES WITH RANDOMIZATION\n\nThe core of Senode is a graph of nodes connected by edges. You decide if Senode acts like a simple vending machine or a complex pinball game. Each node triggers a sound when activated, while edges determine the direction of travel. Instruments are controlled by emitters which send their tokens onto the graph and generate MIDI signals. That means, you can compose a generative music piece for a whole orchestra using the graph notation and a couple of emitters! It gets more interesting if you add random directions or emit multiple tokens at different time positions.\n\n\nGRAPHICAL MULTI-TOUCH INTERFACE\n\nCompose and perform your music live using the intuitive multi-touch interface. Create, drag and connect nodes with multiple fingers. The on-screen keyboard helps you to visualize and edit notes easily.\n\n\nINTEGRATED SYNTHESIZER \n\nThe standalone app contains a simple but powerful subtractive synthesizer with main OSC (sine, saw, square, noise), sub OSC (sine), 1-pole lowpass filter, stereo reverb and ADSR envelope. Try the demo patches to get inspired!\n\n\nMIDI CONTROL AND STEP RECORDING\n\nUse the step record function to create new nodes on the fly, from single notes or using the chord detection. Use a drum kit, wearable sensors or any other MIDI device to control the steps of Senode. Enjoy the unique experience of being your own clock!\n\n\nCONTROL MUSIC APPS AND EXTERNAL DEVICES\n\nSenode is the perfect sequencer for all MIDI-capable apps. Play in sync with other apps using Ableton Link. Integrate with your favourite DAW using the AUv3 plugin (in-app purchase required). If you connect a MIDI interface, you can even control your hardware synths with the app.\n\n\nREALTIME CONTROL\n\nSenode is made for live music performance. There are no default \"beats\" or \"bars\" and all actions are performed in real time. Tokens can be quantized to a clock (16th resolution) and support catch-up, which means you can hit all functions like a drummer \"on the spot\" and stay in sync, even if you're too early or a little late. By the way, the really cool stuff will happen if you break free from 4/4 bar schemes, start your sequences on off-beat timings or create crazy polyrhythmic cycles...\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n- innovative non-linear graphical sequencer with draggable multi-touch interface\n- standalone app and AUv3 MIDI plugin (in-app purchase required) for iPad and iPhone\n- unlimited notes or chords per step with velocity, legato or fixed-length notes\n- unlimited number of steps and directions: cycles, randomized, one-shot\n- multi-timbral patches with polyphonic emitters\n- live arpeggiator mode with hold and monophonic option\n- integrated polysynth with sine, square, saw and noise OSC, ADSR, filter, reverb\n- real-time sequencer control with clock sync and catch-up quantization\n- MIDI device input and output\n- velocity-sensitive binding support for all sequencer operations like step, emit, tick, trigger or clear\n- tempo and start/stop synchronization using Ableton Link\n- step recording with chord detection\n- copy and paste functionality\n- transpose and clock divide functions\n- comes with tutorial and example patches that you can instantly play\n\nSee senode.org for more details."

A GPU-powered, fast and advanced integrated editor is part of TouchOSC on all platforms - create the most complex of control layouts with ease and precision.\n\nMIDI, OSC and more...\n\nTouchOSC supports sending and receiving any number of MIDI and OSC messages on many connections simultaneously. On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

      "label": "• 16 Voices Drum Synthesizer and Stereo Sample Player\n• 2 oscillators (16 Waveforms) per voice with filters, Phase and Ring modulation\n• 1 sample player per voice with sample position, filters, phase and stereo control\n• Expressive instrument: velocity amount per Amp and Pitch modulation (MIDI CC)\n• Randomization engine (Drum Synthesizer, Sample Player, Envelopes)\n• Advanced Pitch and Amp envelopes with multi control points and delay\n• Envelope templates, modifiers and copy/paste\n• Mute/Choke groups: reduce overlapping and keep your drums tight\n• Drag and Drop File Support and multi sample loading\n• Mixer: 16 voices (Multi Output - If Supported By HOST)\n• Pad controller: voices triggered by Pad (MIDI OUT and Velocity Sensitive)\n• Includes classic drum machines built in presets for inspiration\n• Library explorer: drums organized by category\n• iOS AuV3 (iPad/iPhone) - Advanced Responsive Design, portrait and landscape views\n\nEveryone agrees that the drums are a very important key element of almost every genre out there, they are the foundation of a song. We are all fans of acoustic drums and drum machines, they each have different characters and strengths. FAC Drumkit combines both worlds, samples and synthesis, in order to provide new exciting and unique sounds. As a rule of thumb, the synthesizer section brings the body of the sound, and the sampler the unique character. Both parts are layered together and contain essential parameters to ensure they won't clash and will sit well together.\n\nOn top of the samples and synthesizer section, FAC Drumkit brings unique Amp and Pitch envelopes with precise control points to modify the curve in a gentle or extreme way. The envelopes play a very important part in the signal path because, thanks to their flexibility, they allow designing very special transition. Indeed, the envelope of a Clap is probably the best one to illustrate the benefit of such envelopes created with points. The burst kind of sound is very hard to replicate with classic ADSR, it's not the case in FAC Drumkit. Needless to say, thanks to the control points the pitch transitions are also more interesting and precise. The value of each control point can also be altered manually, to set the root note of a kick for example.\n\nFAC Drumkit is for everyone, as sound designer you will be able to synthesize your own drums in a fun and creative way. On the other hand, if you are looking for instant results, use the provided presets or load your favourite sample pack in the sample section of the 16 voices.\n\nThe randomization engine makes the creation of new sounds really easy. Define what you want to randomize and you are ready to go. Remember that instrument category plays a role in the randomization process. For example, if you want to design a drum kick set the instrument label to BD (or use the voice index to get a wider sound palette). It's also very interesting to select a sound you like and start the randomization process from there, in a gentle way or not, thanks to the options available in the voice button (page selector).\n\nFAC Drumkit is an expressive instrument, the amount of velocity can be set individually for each amplitude envelope, and the pitch envelopes can be modulated by external MIDI control change messages. The pitch modulation applies on control points or on the whole pitch envelopes.\n\nImportant: The standalone app is a factory version only and you won't be able to save user presets. Use the AuV3.\n\nThe documentation is available at fredantoncorvest.com/FAC_Drumkit.html"

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed!\n\nSupports playing the alarm Bluetooth devices connected to your iOS device.\n\nNotes\n• Click \"Developer Website\" below on this App Store page for the complete FAQ, or email me at iam@willsaid.com\n• A Free Spotify Account works! However, *you need a premium Spotify account to play the entire song in Spotify*\n• The Spotify Mobile App is not needed\n• Internet connectivity is required to find songs and \"set\" an alarm, but not needed when it goes off.\n• Alarms go off for one minute max, but you can always chain multiple alarms together if you are a heavy sleeper. Spotify's API currently only lets the app play 30 seconds of each song, although entire songs are coming soon.\n• As stated above, the app currently plays 30 second snippets of the best parts of songs, which should be more than enough to wake up.\n• Supports Snoozing, Days to Repeat, and the other features you'd expect from an alarm clock\n• The maker of this app is not attached to Spotify in any way. The app simply plays Spotify Content from Spotify's API.\n• Most but not all Spotify songs are currently available on the app. This is outside my control, and up to which artists approve third party app usage of their content. The selection size has improved since Version 1 and is continuing to do so. Artists not on the app include Bob Marley, Ariana Grande, and Frank Ocean. Please email me BEFORE downloading the app if there's a specific song you are looking for and I can quickly check. Email me at iam@willsaid.com and I will get back to you very quickly!"

      "label": "Grand Finale has been given some much needed love and attention resulting in a major face lift and a some extra horse power under the hood - resulting in Grand Finale 2!  The iOS app now has custom interfaces for iPhone and iPad, and it works both as standalone and as an AUv3 plugin.\n\nGrand Finale 2 is a multi effect audio processing application designed for finalizing complete mixes, stems, voice overs, buses and/or individual audio tracks. The plug-in offers several modules in a pre-routed configuration. Each module has parameters to alter, and most modules offer a set of algorithms to select. These features come together to make Grand Finale a powerful tool for quickly finalizing a track, bus or mix.\n\nUsage:\n\nImport audio files, or extract from a video in the camera roll. Audio can also be imported by using the “Open In..” option in any other app that can export audio.\nUse the playback controls to start and stop playing, and alter the module knobs/options to change how the audio is processed. When satisfied with the result, tap Export to render and save the finalized audio file.\n\nIncluded DSP Modules:\n\nMain bus processing\n\n   • High Pass filter\n\n   • Compressor\n\n   • Multiband Compressor\n\n   • MS Stereo Tool\n\n   • Equalizer\n\n   • Limiter\n\nAdditive/parallel processing\n\n   • Compressor\n\n   • Distortion\n\n\nOther features:\n\n   • Accurate RMS and LUFS metering (tap the meters to swap)\n\n   • 37 professionally made factory presets.\n\n   • Load / Save custom user presets\n\n   • Project manager (load / save full state including audio file data)\n\n   • User manual bundled inside app.\n\n   • Parallel processing is phase linear.\n\n   • Exports to WAV/AIFF/AAC at 16, 24 or 32 bits (sample rate is preserved)\n\n\nListening examples (pre/post) available here: https://soundcloud.com/klevgrandproducts/sets/grand-finale-audio-examples\n \nSaid about Grand Finale:\n\n“The magic behind this plugin is the compressor on the bottom portion, the stereo processor and the incredible EQ section. The bass and treble EQ (in default mode) is the best I've heard by far in a plugin.“ - Robbie Soukiasyan (Skrillex, Tiesto, Usher and more..)\n\n“...and Grand Finale is a genuinely impressive processor for not only the master output, but also mix busses and even individual tracks…” - Computer Music Magazine (CM254)\n\n“Overall, we are impressed by Grand Finale. The plug-in is well thought out and has a very modern, sleek user interface that doesn’t compromise on intuitiveness, metering, or other relevant information and features. Such things help with standing out in the crowded mastering/finalization plug-ins market.” - Gearnews.com"

      "label": "Metronome Touch. Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs. Choose between dark and light design as well as chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\n• Retina display\n Metronome Touch comes with a complete set of vector graphics for all display sizes and looks simply perfect on your device.\n\nFor more informations, app videos, faq's and pictures go to » www.cu4uc.com"

      "label": "The next evolution in music software. Powerful wavetable sound. \nThe next generation ELECTRIBE produces state-of-the-art dance music.\n\nThe ELECTRIBE series first appeared in 1999. Since then each generation has inherited the iconic, intuitive operability of the original while incorporating the most up-to-date sounds and styles.\n\nThe ease of use, accessibility, sound and musicality of the ELECTRIBE reach new heights in this latest software version which features a powerful wavetable sound source, a “Quick Input” sequencer and a convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger. Even if you aren't a musical virtuoso, with ELECTRIBE Wave you can create state-of-the-art dance music like EDM, Future Bass, and Trap.\n\n• Powerful wavetable sound suitable for the latest in EDM\nELECTRIBE Wave has a sound wavetable featuring sounds widely used in the latest music creation. Unlike a PCM synth, the wavetable allows you to repeatedly play fragments of short waveforms, and change the waveform position during playback. By combining the wavetable (which features a rich variety of presets) with a powerful filter and two modulation units, you can create an infinite number of innovative and sharp sounds that cannot be produced using standard PCM synths. Even without a deep knowledge of synthesis techniques, the carefully selected parameters make it easy to craft your sound.\n\n• Improved user interface for quick composition\nThe familiar 16-step pad in the ELECTRIBE series enables speedy rhythm production. The ELECTRIBE Wave also features a new keyboard to play chords and scales. Even without musical knowledge, you can have fun making tracks without worrying about wrong notes. The sequencer features Groove, which can be used to breathe life into rhythm parts, as well as a special keyboard to enable smooth step input for synth parts on the graphical user interface.\n\n• Convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger\nELECTRIBE Wave features a chord pad that allows you to play  chords with one finger. If you use the \"Fetch\" function, it will automatically extract the chords from the song that you are in in the middle of creating and assign those chords to the pad for fast and easy song creation. You can also easily assign and save your favorite chords. In addition you can use the arpeggiator to create new phrases!\n\n• Motion Sequence records and plays temporal changes in sounds and effects\nThe ELECTRIBE series introduced a powerful motion sequence function that remembers and reproduces the movements of the knobs. ELECTRIBE Wave now offers this function for the synthesizer/drum parts so you can create a flow of sound overflowing with originality. If you use the built in KAOSS PAD you can change the sound to drastically with a single fingertip, easily storing and reproducing  temporal changes. Remember the wave table POSITION to make real time minute changes to the sound performance.\n\n• Song mode can combine patterns into finished songs\nUse song mode to create a new track by simply arranging the order of existing patterns. Using only the ELECTRIBE Wave, you can take a song all the way from inspiration to completion. With audio file export, you can send a complete song or individual patterns to your favorite DAW, or upload to services like SoundCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

IT IS THOUGHT TO BE FILLED WITH YOUR OWN COLLECTION WHICH CAN BE EASILY CREATED OR IMPORTED.\n\nWith Perfect Guitar Song Book you always have your collection of guitar songs with you.  You can easily transfer songs from your computer or get them from the Internet and organize  them in lists. The app can handle the most common file formats and comes up with Shake2Scroll, a completely new  scrolling experience.  \n\nFeatures:\n▶ Songs from anywhere ◄ \nSongs may be entered or copied from the Internet as plain text or in Chord Pro format. If plain text is entered, PerfectGuitarSongBook automatically converts the song to the Chord Pro format.  Furthermore, the app allows importing various file formats, such  as PDF, DOC, DOCX, PAGES, CHOPRO, CRD and TXT. PerfectGuitarSongBook can convert simple PDF, DOC, DOCX and PAGES files to ChordPro.\n\n▶ Song editor ◄ \nPerfectGuitarSongBook is the only app in the store that offers \"Magical Features\" which help you to complete and format songs in no time.\n\n▶ File Sharing ◄ \nYou can transfer songs from your computer to the device or open them from any other app featuring the \"Open in\"-Dialog.\n\n▶ View songs the way you want ◄ \nPGSongBook features a customizable song viewer.

You just have to touch the table with your foot to scroll. Thanks to the precision of the iPhone/iPod/iPad's sensors, even the slightest touch is enough. We just want you to have both hands free for the most important: your music. \n\n▶ AutoScroll ◄\nThe app also includes an AutoScroll feature that can be set to different speeds for different parts of a song.\n\n  ▶ Various exporting possibitities ◄ \nPrint your songs, send them as PDF or Chord Pro file or open them as PDF on your device to export them to any app that can open PDF files.  Moreover, you can export playlists as PDFs, which allows you to create full PDF song books - even with hyperlinked index.\n\n▶ TV-Out ◄ \nPerfectGuitarSongBook can display songs on TVs or other external displays, so that even your friends don‘t miss out. (appropriate cable is needed)  \n\n▶ Transposing, Formatting ◄\n Transpose your songs with only a few taps or format them with some so-called Chord Pro directives.\n\n▶ Bluetooth foot switch support ◄  \nUsing a MIDI foot switch like the iRig BlueBoard by IK Multimedia, you can navigate through the whole app without having to touch the screen.\nAlso simpler non-midi pedals are supported."

Here's what the reviews say: \n\n\"Perfect for on the move acid sessions, the Trouble Maker app faithfully recreates the sound of the original TB-303\" - DJ Mag\n\n\"Troublemaker is absolutely no trouble at all to heartily recommend\" - SoundOnSound\n\n\"If you want to make the bassline from Josh Wink’s ‘Higher State of Consciousness’ on the bus, this is the app for the job\" - Factmag.com\n\n\"Top-notch stuff from a developer that just keeps getting better\" - Musicappblog.com\n\n\"This app has been consuming all of my time this week! Love it!\" - Discchord.com\n\nIntroducing Troublemaker: this is not a 303\n\nThe legendary TB-303 has magical properties; it is filled to the brim with analog shimmer. Its output jack is a gateway to a parallel universe and when you twiddle the filter knobs an army of highly trained pixies chisel the square waves from freshly harvested unicorn souls. So if you want a TB-303, you should buy a TB-303. But if you're after *that sound* Troublemaker will give you everything you need in spades.\n\nTroublemaker sports a carefully crafted diode filter emulation and among the available oscillators are the typical raspy, nasal sawtooth and rubbery squarewave with its oddball shape and shifting pulsewidth. \n\nIt also has the wow.\n\nTroublemaker is fully Audio Unit (AUv3) compatible, so you can go wild running multiple instances in your favorite DAWs. \n\nIt also has:\n- Ableton Link synchronization, \n-  MIDI CC controllers for all knobs (predefined), \n- Core Midi, Virtual Midi, Bluetooth Midi input, \n- MIDI Clock Sync, MIDI Start / Stop support\n- Realtime Mutation Probability Engine\n- Standalone sequencer supports 1-64 steps\n- Audiobus 3 support (audio + MIDI) \n- Exports MID and WAV files from the standalone sequencer\n- User manual and MIDI charts on ruismaker.com\n- Comes with an extra AUv3 plugin version of a modded Troublemaker unit\n\nAnd unlike the TB-303, it can actually sound like a bass guitar ;-)"

Thanks to a powerful feedback section containing, inter alia, two pitch shifters, the unit is able to deliver the very typical \"Shimmer\" sound kind effect very much prized by musicians that are making ambient music, or any kind of music that needs to be carried by a fabulous angelic evolving choir section.\n\nFAC Alteza is definitely not \"another shimmer reverb...\" effect because it comes with additional parameters that make it very versatile. A particular attention to each part of the signal path was necessary to reach this level of high-end quality.\n\nHere some features that make FAC Alteza an outstanding unit:\n\n• the input signal is not monoized by default, a knob allows to control the width of the input stereo image before reaching the reverb\n• the topology of the effect, based upon a series of All-Pass delays, allows to control the intrasec characteristics of the reverberation\n• the number of All-Pass delays per stage and the echo density are alterable in the main section and in the feedback section\n• two ultra low latency pitch shifters deliver progressive pitch-shifting of the reverberation tail or the input signal\n• the feedback section contains a blend knob to control how much of the original signal is mixed with the feedback reverb\n• the wet signal can be ducked by an external signal provided by the host\n\nNote:\n- AuV3 and Standalone App\n- To use the sidechain and/or to output the additional feedback signal, you need a host able to provide to the AuV3 an input bus and an additional output bus.\n\nThe documentation is available at fredantoncorvest.com/FAC_Alteza.html"

      "label": "Loop-based mangler effect for creating slowly changing rhythmic sound structures in a deep reverb space from any external signal. Great for experimenting and designing ambient and noise backgrounds with rhythmic elements.\n\nThe principle of the application is quite simple. It is based on a loop recorder with two loops. When one loop is recorded, the second is played back. When the loop recording stops, there is a smooth transition between them. Three separate outputs can playback the recorded loop with different pitches (speeds), each with its own effects and two automation generators. The mix of these outputs is fed to the convolution reverb. The reverb is packed with a set of long and deep sound spaces that create a blurry and ambient sound.\n\nBut the main feature of this application is its well designed parameters that make it easy to experiment with a huge number of sound options using any source material from live instruments to synthesized sound. With just two parameters you can add complex rhythmic structures based on Euclidean rhythms, and easy-to-use automation generators with a randomize option to add variations to the sound, allowing you to modify parameters like an LFO or based on a given rhythm. The convolution reverb has advanced options with which you can change and extend the original reverb spaces.\n\nEven using the randomization button, in almost every case, you will get interesting and various soundscapes and textures. With this option it is very easy to create the basis of new, unique presets, requiring only slight tweaks to some parameters to get impressive results.\n\nThe loop recorder can be started and stopped manually or by input signal, can use fixed length or overwrite the loop while recording, and has the option for crossfade between the end and the beginning of the loop. All this makes it convenient for live use as well as when processing recorded material. As an extended option, you can use a special mode in which the application works as a direct effect, without the loop recorder.\n\nThe special panel Sampler is designed for quickly load samples and easy control of the application when used it live. This panel contains the input and output controls, essential controls of the loop recorder, and a large area with a recording counter, which is also used to start/stop the recorder. You can assign up to nine samples for fast loading into the loop, as well as save a recorded loop as a sample and to an external file.\n\nSpaceFields is a universal application for iOS and macOS. It can work on iPhone and iPad as well as Mac / MacBook with M1 chip (and later). SpaceFields works on iPhone and iPad standalone, as an Audio Unit or Inter-App Audio module, and supports Audiobus and Ableton Link. On macOS, SpaceFields can works both as a standalone application and as an Audio unit (AUv3) with DAWs and audio unit hosts like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, GarageBand, MainStage, Cockos Reaper, Plogue Bidule, Hosting AU, and other hosts that support AUv3 plugins. All application features are available on iOS and macOS, including MIDI support (with a midi learn option), audio unit parameters and importing samples from any directory on device. SpaceFields has a built-in detailed description of all parameters also available as PDF file on application site.\n\nPresets demo:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL1Dis3u0AQ\n\nThe Sampler mode overview:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpkWkc5I0uE\n\nYou can find more information on SpaceFields and other experimental and audio processing apps at:\n\nhttps://motion-soundscape.blogspot.com"

      "label": "WOV for iOS is an AUv3 effect for making a wide range of textures out of your sounds – from familiar tremolo waves to glitchy stutters and everything in between. \n\nWOV lands on iOS with an injection of inspiring presets by Richard Devine and Stèv!\n\n*** Please note: WOV is an Audio Unit extension (AUv3) – it only works in an AUv3 host app like Garageband, AUM, Cubasis, Modstep, Beatmaker 3, etc... ***\n\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS / DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Rate Section\nThis section determines the rate or speed at which WOV operates. Rate can either be assigned in Hz, or in fractions of a beat in sync with a hosting app – to switch between Hz and sync modes, use the switches at the bottom center of WOV.\nIt’s easy to set up a static rate for WOV and leave things at that – but WOV has much more to offer! To the right of the Rate control, the bipolar Response knob sets the sensitivity with which WOV’s rate will either slow down or speed up depending on the volume of the incoming signal. The bipolar Variation control further introduces randomized amounts of variation to the rate – at its extremes going as far half the rate (knob to the far left) or twice the rate (knob to the far right).\n\nThe Depth Section\nDepth sets the amount of modulation over the dry signal – to the left and it’s more subtle, all the way to the right and WOV will act as a repeating gate. Silence introduces more randomness to the plugin, increasing the likelihood that the amplitude will be zero for some cycles.\n\nThe Waveform Section\nThe waveform of a tremolo effect is essentially its repeating envelope. Classic tremolo effects offer stock waves – WOV, being a K-Devices product, is much more customizable!\nThe Wave knob morphs between a quasi-sine shape (far left) and a slightly rounded-off square shape (far right). Peak acts as a kind of attack control for the waveform – far left for a sharp attack, or far right to reach the peak more gradually. Finally, the Warp knob allows you to either squeeze or expand the waveform, affecting the length of each sound. When the Wave control is set to a full square, Warp acts as a duty cycle/pulsewidth control.\n\nThe Accents Multislider\nThe eight-step sequencer uses a multislider to set the relative accent value for each beat of the rate. The slider adjusts between two and eight steps in length, and a button offsets the accents going to the right channel one step over from the left (note that this requires Stereo to be enabled).\n\n— \n\nGet Wide\nWOV can either preserve the stereo placement of its input signal, or it can add stereo offset to the output signal. Enabling the Stereo switch directly affects the Response, Silence, and Sequencer for a wider sound.\n\nGo By Feel\nAs part of encouraging more musical and creative applications of WOV, in addition to using symbols for controls, the controls in WOV do not have individual readouts. We encourage you to let your ears determine the right knob positions whenever you can! If you’d like a precise readout, however, you can see/edit it by clicking on any parameter and looking in the upper-right corner of WOV.\n\nIcons\nBy default, all labels are graphical – for text labels, click the symbols/text label switch in the lower-right had corner."

So let's get straight to what makes FAC Medusa a new versatile and characterful compressor!\n\nFAC Medusa combines different dynamic processors into a single and easy to use unit, the input signal flows along the following stages:\n\n1) \"Pre-amp with tone control and saturation circuit\" The input signal is split into three bands of frequencies (Low, Mid and High) according two adjustable crossover points. Setting the level and the saturation amount of each frequency band will definitely make the effect more natural or characterful.\n\n2) \"Compression\" In addition to the usual controls you may expect, FAC Medusa also provides two types of compression. Downward compression, which is obviously the most common, decreases the level of audio signal above the threshold. And also Upward compression which is less known, despite powerful, and increases the level of audio signal below the threshold. The compression can operate either on the SUM of the frequency bands (L+M+H) or on each frequency band coming from stage 1.\n\n3) \"Parallel compression and Brickwall limiter\" The master Brickwall limiter is optional and will ensure that the output of stage 2, possibly blended with the original audio signal, remain under control. The limiter comes with threshold and release time controls.\n\nAs you have realized FAC Medusa has many faces: gentle, natural, or aggressive and colorful. Choose the one you want and be prepared for an exciting sound design experience. Whether you are a budding music producer or passionate amateur musician in any genre, you will definitely find a happy use for it!\n\nThe documentation is available at fredantoncorvest.com/FAC_Medusa.html"

This is so most users can stay on one simple screen and effortlessly access all of the features found on typical metronomes, plus a whole lot more. This screen is called The Basic Met. It has an unprecedented speed range of 1-1000, tap tempo, volume control and seven time-signatures. All of this fits on one awesome screen and is so easy to use a five-year-old can do it. The Basic met more than meets the needs of most metronome users. But, for those who want more, The Prog Met is a multi-screen engine that allows the user to completely control what happens in each bar of a custom made click track with unlimited bars. Tracks can be named, saved and opened for reuse. For each bar, the user can control: Tempo (1-1000 BPM), number of beats, accent, and subdivision of beat. Assign any note in a three-octave range to the subdivision or it can be a click. Morph tempos over user defined time periods from any tempo to any other tempo.

It will leave out beats randomly to force you to strengthen your own inner time-keeping muscles, and it has other cool features for odd meters, drum machine-style patterns, and more... this is an awesome learning, grooving, solidifying tool.\"\n\nStrengthen your inner sense of rhythm! Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

This tool is meant to bring character, or \"dirt\" to your incoming audio signals. Save your own presets for instance recall of the sound you've created to find the \"sweet spot\" in your instruments and/or mixes.\n\nLo-Fly Dirt installs as an Audio Unit effect for hosts that support the format such as Audio Bus, Beatmaker 3, Garage Band, Cubasis, AUM, etc.\n\nDefault Mode: \nAdds subtle character of the input sound. Simple saturation and light, preset compression are added to the overall sound bringing out unique tones & textures of your source audio. The wet/dry knob at the 100 or full position would leave source audio \"warmed up.\" \n\n60 Mode: \nThis preset mode is based on some of our favorite characteristics of an iconic drum machine. Activating this button should invite you to 12 bit nostalgia immediately boasting tasteful saturation, small amounts of compression, and a more rounded high end. Great on drums.\n\n404 Mode [Green Light]: \nOne of our favorites, this mode is the only mode that should add subtle low-pass filtering to the input signal. This mode will apply low pass filtering at 12db per octave around 11.6Khz. The wet/dry knob will continue to filter the sound to no more than 200Hz. The signal will benefit from some additional signal boosting with minimal make-up gain and small amounts of bit rate reduction, or \"dirt.\"\n\n404 Mode [Orange Light]: \nThis mode brings the coveted vinyl simulation to Lo-Fly Dirt. Mix knob will tastefully add intensity to your track with it. Try using this mode on an aux/bus channel and send select sounds through it. Very cool stuff!\n\n1200 Mode:\nAlso built around our love for another iconic drum machine, this mode brings great punch, character, and dirt to any signal it treats. Especially useful for drums and percussion based audio.\nmore punchier variation of the 60 mode. Enjoy 12 bit goodness by default, but additionally a boost the signals character by our dirt and boost in the low-mid frequencies.\n\n8 Bit Mode:\nSimply put, this mode brings back the classic sound of a legendary game console. We've added a bit of punch to the incoming signal and you're able to blend it with great 8 bit artifacts that will allow for some brand new creations...and fun!\n\nSK- 5 Mode: \nAlso built off the things we love about the classic 8 bit sound, but with a twist...this mode adds HP filtering and punch! Instant dirt is applied when this mode is activated, high pass filtering and punch is applied as you move the signal from dry to wet. The HP filter is set to cutoff at 300Hz."

Use device sensors like Touch, Accelerometer, Microphone and Camera (face, hand and body joint tracking and depth sensor support) to generate MIDI signals. Route the MIDI signals through effect modules to control multiple instruments simultaneously or generate creative combinations.\n\nMusiKraken supports sending and receiving MIDI data over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or via Core MIDI (for example by using Inter-Device Audio and MIDI (IDAM)). And it can host Audio Unit Instruments.\n\nImportant: Please note that some of the modules only work on iOS devices with specific hardware: ARKit Face Tracking and the TrueDepth module need a TrueDepth front camera, and Hand and Body Joint Tracking needs at least iOS 14, and might be too slow on older devices.\n\nInput Modules:\n-Keyboard: MPE support, scale highlighting, control multiple values by sliding and touch pressure or finger radius.\n-Chords Pad: Play chords and its inversions of a selected scale.\n-Touchpad: Slide multiple fingers on a touchpad to control up to 5 values simultaneously.\n-ARKit Face Tracking: Uses the TrueDepth camera to generate notes or control parameters using your mouth, eyes, tongue or by moving your head.\n-Mouth Tracking: Uses the normal camera to control parameters using your mouth.\n-TrueDepth: Use the depth signal of your camera to generate MIDI data by moving your hand (or anything else) in front of the device.\n-Hand Tracking: Uses the camera to convert your hand position and simple hand gestures to MIDI. You can use one or two hands and it can also use the TrueDepth sensor if available.\n-Body Tracking: Uses the camera to track hand, feet and head positions of up to two persons.\n-Motion Sensors: Uses the combination of Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer to detect the current rotation of the device.\n-Accelerometer: Measures the acceleration of the device.\n-Apple Watch: Use the motion sensors, heart rate, touch and digital crown.\n-Game Controller: Use buttons, thumbsticks and everything else.\n-Microphone: Detects pitch and volume using the microphone.\n-External Input Device: Receives MIDI events of connected input devices.\n\nOutput Modules:\n-External Output Device: Send MIDI events to any device accessible via Core MIDI.\n-AudioUnit: Load any Music Device or MIDI Processor Audio Unit and generate sounds directly in the app.\n-Core MIDI Network: Send MIDI via WiFi.\n-Snarp Network MIDI: My own implementation to send MIDI via WiFi.\n-SimpleSynth: Generate simple synthesizer sounds directly on the device.\n\nEffects:\n-Chord Splitter: Splits incoming chords into separate notes and sends these to separate channels. This allows you to play multiple (legato-) instruments simultaneously.\n-Channel Switcher: Change the MIDI channel of events.\n-Value to MIDI Converter: To convert numerical values (green ports) to MIDI events (orange ports), it needs a converter. Converters can convert incoming numbers to notes, CC, Channel Pressure or Pitch Bend events.\n-MIDI Transposer: Transpose MIDI notes up or down.\n-Arpeggiator: Cycles through the notes of incoming chords in a specific pattern.\n-Speed: Computes a new value based on the change speed of another value.\n-Beat: Play a beat if a value is changed quickly.\n-Threshold: Plays notes if a value goes over a specific threshold.\n-LFO: Generates an LFO from incoming values.\n-Envelope: Generates an ADSR output value based on note input.\n-Latch: Keeps notes alive until the same note is played again."

Get your ideas out or play until inspiration hits using a selection of Ableton Live’s drum kits, synths and melodic instruments. Or create your own sound palette by recording the sounds around you into Note’s sampler instruments using your phone’s microphone. \n\nIf you want to take your ideas further, use Ableton Cloud to send your projects to Live (version 11.2.5 or later) without leaving the app. Open your project from Live’s browser, then keep working – you can edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds from Note are exactly the same.\n\n\nBegin with a beat: \n• Choose from 56 Drum Sampler kits\n• Tap out a beat using the 16-pad grid\n• Quantize your beat to fix any loose timing\n• Nudge notes to correct mistakes\n• Add more layers of rhythm\n• Create beat repetitions with Note Repeat\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Experiment with effects \n\nStart with a melody:\n• Choose from 261 synth sounds and 36 Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Play your melody or chord progression with either the 25-pad grid or the piano roll\n• Set a key and scale to get instantly harmonic results, or leave your options open\n• Overdub more layers of harmony\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Add effects to experiment with sound design\n\nSample your environment:\n• Create your own kits by recording percussive sounds into Note’s Drum Sampler \n• Record tonal sounds to create your own Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Manipulate your samples by cutting, filtering or repitching them\n• Shape or transform your sounds with effects\n\nCapture improvisations:\n• Play something, then tap the Capture button to keep it\n• Play at the tempo that feels comfortable and Note will detect it\n• Note will recognize the length of the phrase\n• A loop is created automatically\n• Quantize it, add to it, or change the sound\n\nCreate variations:\n• Note features a grid-based Session View layout\n• Double your loops to create variation within clips\n• Duplicate your clips and create different versions of your ideas\n• Create eight tracks with up to eight clips on eight scenes\n• Try different layer combinations and song structures \n• Export your work in Session View as an audio file to listen and share"

Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

      "label": "Create music with Loopy HD by layering looped recordings of singing, beatboxing, or playing an instrument with a savvy, sophisticated, tactile looper that totally reinvents the formula. As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com. I may be able to fix your issue in less time than it would take to write a negative review!"

      "label": "SWAM Solo Woodwinds has arrived on iOS! The incredibly powerful Physical Modeling technology is now MOBILE. Extreme Expressivity and Realism delivered in a package of only 46 MB\nThese instruments are NOT sample libraries. Unlike sampling, which uses recordings to replicate the sound of an instrument, physical modeling doesn’t generate a sound as such but creates the conditions for the system to create it according to an external input (like someone playing on a keyboard).\n\nWith our SWAM Tenor Sax for iOS, you now have the unique ability to express yourself with all the emotions  and subtleties of a natural string instrument sound as played by a real player, in any style — from classical to film scoring and even microtonal music.\n\nSWAM Tenor Sax for iOS can be used as a standalone instrument for playing in real-time, or as a plug-in for mobile music production. Play with your favorite external controller or directly from your iOS device through our intuitive interface.\n\nWith SWAM Tenor Sax for iOS you can:\n- Explore our collection of presets, create your own, or import them from your Desktop\n- Play in real-time using the standalone version of the app\n- Play with different instrument bodies\n- Play in a variety of styles like a real player\nControl the instrument’s expressivity in real-time directly through the touch control interface on your iPhone or iPad  including the exclusive virtual bowing touch surface!\n- Play and control the instrument’s expressivity in real-time using your favorite external controller (ROLI Seaboard, Akai EWI, breath controllers, regular keyboards, and more)\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version to produce music with a mobile setup\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version in combination with Camelot PRO for live performances\n- Adjust every aspect of the instrument’s sound (timbre, vibrato, amount of air, etc.) through an easy-to-use control panel\n- Micro-tune the instrument through the Pitch Manager (note: MAQAM device is supported with direct integration)\n- Add built-in effects such as Reverb, EQ, and Compressor\n- Have access to easy MIDI control configurations\n\nThe SWAM Tenor Sax for iOS is for you if:\n- You’re a wind controller player looking for a mobile setup to perform live without needing a computer while still having an incredible sound.\n- You’re a keyboard player and feeling frustrated by the limited expressive capabilities normal sample-based plugins give you.\n- You’re a music producer looking for a mobile setup to produce music from anywhere without having to carry around expensive gear.\n- You’re looking for a virtual instrument that allows you to express the full range of your musicality easily  on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you choose to play using an external controller, please note that a controller with the ability to continuously control the expression (like an expression pedal, breath controller, MPE device, wind controller, …) is REQUIRED. The same way real players need a bow to express themself on their instrument, SWAM Tenor Sax needs something to control its expressivity. SWAM instruments do not work with just note-on velocity."

While a chord is played, related chords are highlighted so you can easily find chord sequences that progress smoothly. Once you found a nice chord sequence, you can drag and drop chords into your song to build your composition upon it.\nIf you want to start your song with a melody and find a suitable chord progression, you can do that just as well: select notes and tap the search icon to show chords that match your melody fragment. It's real fun to experiment, seeing how different harmonic contexts affect the perception of the same melodic fragment.\n\n\nCreate Beautiful Melodies and Flowing Chord Progressions\n\nIn the piano roll, notes that are in harmony as well as the chords' root notes are highlighted. This makes it super easy to create leads, arpeggios and basslines and to experiment with different chord voicings to let your chord progressions flowing nicely. \n\n\nIntuitive Editing\n\nA simple, yet feature rich and context-aware user interface helps you build up your ideas into whole songs:\nGroup sections into song parts and arrange them via drag and drop. \nDuplicate, copy and paste, playback selected notes.\n\n\nFile Export\n\nExport and share your creations with audio file export.\nEdit your song in other Apps with MIDI-file export.\n\n\nUse your Favorite Instrument Apps\n\nIt's just more fun to explore and create with those awesome Instrument Apps that are available in the App Store: Klimper supports Inter-App-Audio Instruments like Animoog and Model 15 as well as Audio Unit Instruments like Ripplemaker and Mersenne.\n\n\nVideo Tutorials\n\nThe included tutorial will help you getting started.

      "label": "The latest title in the KORG DS-10 series, now available for the iOS!\n\nThe KORG DS-10 series was an enormous hit for the Nintendo DS. Now, seven years later, it has undergone a further evolution while staying true to its original spirit. Now available is the KORG iDS-10, a portable synthesizer studio for iOS. \n\nThe KORG iDS-10 combines a cutting-edge analog synthesizer, voice synthesizer, and analog drum machine inspired by motifs from the original KORG DS-10. This iOS app gives you a hand-held system to easily create electronic music, which requires persuasive sound with a minimal number of notes.\n\n*** Powerful analog synthesizer lets you visually learn sound design ***\nThe analog synthesizer provides carefully selected parameters, making it easy to enjoy sound design. The unique patching function also lets you create sound in even deeper ways. Since all parameters can be automated, you have a wide range of song-production possibilities. Each synthesizer provides five types of effect with an oscilloscope that helps you see the sound. This cutting-edge synth engine takes full advantage of the iOS device’s CPU to generate astonishing sound, and will heighten your enjoyment using the KORG DS-10.\n\n*** Enter your lyrics, and the voice synthesizer turns them into a voice ***\nThe voice synthesizer is one of the popular features of the KORG iDS-10. Based on a vocoder, its engine makes it easy to generate voices. It also supports input via a microphone which can be used as a conventional vocoder. The parameters are optimized for creating such voices, so you’ll be able to enjoy sound design with a different character than an analog synthesizer, further widening the possibilities for your music.\n\n*** Analog drum synthesizer makes it easy to produce the sounds that you want ***\nDrums are now more important than ever, and the iDS-10 provides an analog drum machine that’s carefully tuned for easy creation of powerful sounds. With total control over six drum sounds (kick, snare, hihat1 / ihat2, tom, and percussion), you can create awesome tracks with high impact.\n\n*** Smart keyboard and KAOSS mode make step-recording enjoyable ***\nThe smart keyboard lets you specify a scale so that you can step-record without worrying about “wrong” notes. And of course there’s also KAOSS mode, where you can produce a limitless range of great-sounding phrases, with just a touch of the keyboard. The scale setting is also applied to the sequencer’s note display, so you can enjoy producing songs whether or not you have any musical knowledge or experience.\n\n*** Pattern play that you can perform in real time ***\nThe pattern play capability of the KORG DS10 has further evolved, generating amazing user performances. You can seamlessly play 32 patterns, and also manipulate track mute and solo settings in real time. It’s guaranteed to result in the kind of protean acts that are notable in modern day DJ performances.\n\n*** Send your songs by email for collaborative music productions ***\nThere’s a function that allows the transfer of song data via email, making it easy to exchange songs with your friends.\n\n*** Mystery bingo!? ***\nAnd then there’s the enigmatic mystery bingo; as you continue enjoying the KORG iDS-10, the full picture will become clearer …\n\nThis app was produced in cooperation with the game music and app production company “Detune.” Don’t miss this opportunity to experience the world of the KORG iDS-10 that resulted from this collaboration with Detune Inc.\n\nThe first title in the KORG DS-10 series was the KORG DS-10 which was announced in 2008. The second title was the KORG DS-10 PLUS which launched in 2009.\nThese are products of Marvelous Inc.

Expand your arsenal to 125 total licks, sweeping such genres as Blues, Texas Blues, Rock, Classic Rock, Metal, Punk and more to come. These tasteful and timeless licks (recorded by real musicians) are inspired by such greats as Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Slash, Joe Perry, Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King, \"Dimebag\" Darrell Abbott, Kirk Hammett and others. \n\nCREATED FOR GUITARISTS, BY GUITARISTS\nOur mission was to create a faster and more practical way to learn guitar licks than ever before. We've done it! Enjoy these key features:\n\n• 50+ essential, hand-picked licks (various genres)\n• Color-coded \"Smart Tabs\" for FAST learning\n• NO videos (videos are a slower way to learn licks)\n• Real audio recorded by real musicians\n• Each lick is split into smaller, easier parts\n• Half-speed playback\n• Landscape mode for longer tabs\n• Metronome toggle to keep time\n• Loopable parts\n• Lick Store w/ Voodoo Fire & Metal Masters add-ons\n• Mystery Pack (Get 25 free licks by sharing the app)\n\n...And coming soon over the next few updates:\n\n• Fingering notations for all tabs\n• Backing tracks for all licks!!!\n• iPad version\n\n---------------------------\n\nIntroducing \"Smart Tabs\". \n\nThe heart and soul of Guitar Lick Master lies in our revolutionary \"Smart Tabs\". Each lick features an interactive, color-coded tab that drastically simplifies the lick learning process. Most licks only have 3-4 parts total - you'll be amazed how quickly you pick them up, and how easily you remember them! \n\n---------------------------\n\nFaster Learning Without Videos\n\nSince the 1980's, video tutorials have been one of the most common ways to learn guitar licks. But as a modern teaching aid, video has some severe limitations. While sometimes informative and entertaining, passive, non-interactive videos are an extremely inefficient way to learn this type of material; the only way to control what you learn and at what speed is by pausing and rewinding countless times until it sinks in. \n\nWatching an instructor sit and play *feels* productive, but it actually creates more work than is necessary and as a result is very time-consuming. For starters, their guitar is usually facing the wrong direction (unlike playing in front of a mirror). This requires your brain to flip the image. Multiple camera angles are a nice touch but with a maximum of two eyeballs, most humans can only watch one camera angle at a time. If we want to see the whole picture we have to pause and rewind again and again. The worst aspect of videos though is that licks aren't broken down into easy-to-learn parts for the viewer; the instructor usually just plays through it a few times from memory and expects you to rewind the video until you memorize it. After wasting months pausing and rewinding lick tutorials, we realized something was wrong. The world needed a modern solution!\n\n---------------------------\n\nHere's a little test: Which number do you find easier to read?\n\n5557874634\n\nvs \n\n555-787-4634\n\nThe second one is easier to read and will be easier to remember too. Why? Because it's organized and broken down into smaller parts. This is precisely the simple technique we've applied to every lick in Guitar Lick Master!\n\nDownload Guitar Lick Master and start building up your arsenal of awesome licks today!"

      "label": "Modal Buddy for guitar is a fun and unique practice tool that teaches you modal theory in one day. \n\nIt's also a jam tool that provides looping backing tracks, scale charts, and let's you explore the anatomy of modal scales. \n\nNow you (and your students) can conquer modes quickly and spend more time soloing!\n\n---------\n\n“I’m a music teacher with 25+ years exp… Every musician should have a working knowledge of modes and this app is concise, linear, and very well done.” - Rich in Jax, Customer, USA\n\n“Modes are somewhat confusing at first and without the right guidance can be tricky. This app makes it easy. As a teacher myself I will be showing students this cool little practice app.” - DannyK6, Customer, USA\n\n“A revolutionary interactive modal practice tool.” - Paul Riario, Guitar World Magazine\n\n---------\n\nModal Buddy arms guitarists and instructors with an intuitive, step-by-step method for teaching and practicing modal theory, improving proficiency and bolstering the value of lessons. It empowers you with a fun and efficient vehicle for exploring the truly magical yet notoriously complicated world of musical modes. \n\n---------\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Checklist-style theory section for lightweight, structured learning\n- Audio examples (with solos)\n- Backing tracks to practice all seven modes\n- Zoomable scale charts\n- Practice examples\n- Revolutionary jam tool\n- Beautiful, intuitive design\n\n---------\n\nQ: WHO IS THIS APP FOR?\n\n1) Music instructors with a BASIC understanding of modal theory who want to increase their confidence and effectiveness in teaching this fairly complex topic.\n\n2) Music instructors with a COMPLETE understanding of modal theory who are looking for an easier, more consolidated approach to teaching and practicing the material with students.\n\n3) Intermediate to advanced music students who are proficient in pentatonic and major scales and are interested in achieving more expressive guitar improvisation / melody creation. \n\nQ: MODAL THEORY LITERATURE IS AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE - WHY BUY THIS APP?\n\nThe breadth of freely available information about modal theory is the main reason it’s so difficult to learn (and teach) - there is simply too much out there, and much of it is poorly written or incorrect; a recipe for confusion! Teaching modal theory effectively requires a distillation and simplification of core concepts, organized strategically so they're easy for students to learn - and a method for applying those skills during lessons. \n\nFor less than the cost of an average theory book, we've consolidated and organized modal theory into it's finest form, and hand-crafted a completely custom experience, ideal for mastering the material. We know you and your students will love our approach!\n \n---------\n\nFeel free to send any questions to support@ninebuzz.com."

      "label": "ScaleMate is the master scale tool for musicians and educators.\nIt lets you visualize scales in ways that make their important qualities leap out at you.\n\nScaleMate is a reference that shows you & plays for you any scale you wish…. But that's just the beginning. ScaleMate helps you hear & understand scales and harmony more deeply than ever before… by teaching you to visualize scales in ways that match what they sound like.\n\nImagine… Wouldn't it be nice to have a single image for all the modes of the major scale?\nEver wonder why the modes are ordered so oddly, hopping between major & minor & dominant?\nOr notice that the Altered Scale is the \"darkest\", most minor sounding of all possible dominant scales?\nOr that its tritone-substitution, the Lydian Dominant Scale, is the \"brightest\" of them all?\nEver notice that the minor pentatonic scale is a mode of the major pentatonic scale and wonder whether there were any other useful pentatonic modes?\nEver notice that the major pentatonic scale (and its modes) are the only 5-note scale that doesn't contain any half steps or tritones?\n\nScaleMate shows you scales in a way that makes these observations quite natural and immediate… and plays you the results too.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n• USE IT RIGHT AWAY\nTry ScaleMate right now! Built-in help is there for you whenever you want it.\n\n• LISTEN\nScaleMate lets you hear what scales sound like, by playing them up & down, or by playing endless melodies that use them.\n\n• VISUALIZE WHAT YOU HEAR\nScaleMate shows every scale both linearly (for melodic understanding) and on the circle of fifths (for harmonic understanding).\n\n• FULL LIBRARY OF SCALES\nScaleMate knows all the scales you're ever likely to encounter.\n\n• A WELLSPRING OF KNOWLEDGE\nExtensive information pages on 40+ of the most common & important scales.\n\n• USE IT TO TEACH!\nScaleMate is perfect for projecting on a screen or sharing over zoom while you teach. Its animations let you show how one scale transforms into another, and it has special features (pointing, hiding/revealing) for educators.\n\n• AUTOMATIC SCALE RECOGNITION\nBuild your own scales and ask yourself \"what if I make this change…\" Whenever you produce a common scale, ScaleMate will automatically identify & title it.\n\n• ANIMATED IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES\nChange between one scale and another and see the differences between them, visually animated before you.\n\n• SMART SPELLING\nScaleMate notates perfectly, for every scale in every key.\n\n• NOTE ROLES\nNext to each note, ScaleMate displays its function—in numbers (3, 5, b7) or in solfege (Mi, Sol, Te) or not at all, according to your preference.\n\n• SIMPLE OR ADVANCED NOTATION\nScaleMate shows you double flats and double sharps whenever they're called for… unless you'd rather see simplified note names. Prefer never to see notes like Cb and E# either? You can have ScaleMate show them as B and F.\n\n• DIMINISHED HARMONY\nChoose the option to color the notes in three colors so you can see which diminished seventh chord every note belongs to. Great for understanding diminished scales & chords and seeing how they relate to other scales too.\n\n• JAZZ CRED\nScaleMate is created by Anton Schwartz. An award-winning saxophonist and composer as well as an expert educator, he is the creator of the highly rated RANDOM ROOTS app.\n\n\n\nTerms and conditions:  https://scalemate.app/terms-conditions\n\nPrivacy policy:  https://scalemate.app/privacy"

Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

      "label": "EōN is a new relationship to \"recorded\" music as we have always known it by immersing the listener in an endless sound (and visual) experience, like an album whose duration would have no fixed limit.\n\nEōN produces an infinite music, in constant evolution, abundant in variations, composed by electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre, accompanied by a constant progression of organic visual elements.\n\nOnce the EōN app is activated, you will listen and watch a new unlimited music experience constantly unfold, designed to be absolutely unique for each listener, always different each time the app is launched.\n\nYou can enjoy a different journey everytime, listening as many times and as long as you want, the only limit being your device’s battery!\n\nIn addition, once downloaded, EōN is fully autonomous requiring no internet connection. Thus it is possible to launch the app anywhere and at any time.\n\nJEAN-MICHEL JARRE ABOUT EōN:\n  \"-Eon- the name of an ancient Greek God associated with unlimited time and eternity.\n\nI named this project EōN as it symbolizes exactly what it is: an infinite musical and visual creation, which offers to everyone a unique experience, which will never happen again: on each device and each activation of the application EōN, you will hear and see an ever-evolving orchestration of music and visuals. EōN is an endless organic work, never repetitive, that will live and grow indefinitely at your fingertip.\n\nLike in life, every moment lived in EōN will never happen again.\n\nPersonally, I truly feel that EōN is probably one of my most exciting creative projects since Oxygene. I always wanted to create a specific music for each listener, able to evolve constantly in terms of rhythms, tones, tempo, melodies and textures. Here it is. EōN is conceived and composed as a different journey for everyone, with no end determined.\n\nI had a clear idea of the organic, living visuals I wanted to accompany my music, and I was very lucky to spend some time in Tokyo at Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc. (Sony CSL), where I discovered Alexis André and his singular visual world. Sony CSL with Alexis have conceived and developed an algorithm generating an endless flow of ever-evolving graphics, which, like the music, are infinite and never repeatitive.\n\nThe algorithm and audio engine that orchestrates the music of the EōN app have been engineered by Alexis Zbik & Vianney Apreleff from BLEASS after defining the rules of the system together. \"\n\n\nCREDITS\nConceived and composed by Jean-Michel Jarre\nDigital Graphics by Alexis André of Sony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc.

      "label": "Tempi measures you and your entire band’s tempo live, while you play, and lets you analyze the performance when you’re done. It's like a reverse metronome.\n\n* Tempi listens while you (or your entire band) play.\n* Tempi reports the BPM (beats per minute) of your performance in real time with remarkable accuracy.\n* When you’re done, Tempi lets you analyze the recording so that problem areas can be pinpointed and improved.\n* Use Tap for Tempo to quickly get a BPM reading at any time.\n* Switch themes for easy nighttime use or just to suit your style.\n* Export the audio recording of your performance to keep or share with others.\n\nHOW TO USE\n\nIn a band setting, place the iPhone or iPad in a position where the entire band can see it so everyone will know when the band is speeding up or slowing down. When you’re done playing the song, press the stop button to analyze the performance. You can scroll through the entire song, isolate where the tempo sped up or slowed down, and play back the song to get an idea of what went wrong.\n\nTempi is great for individual practice too. Use it instead of a metronome while practicing to pinpoint problem areas in a piece of music that you’re learning. If you can play through an entire song with the tempo only changing by 1 or 2 BPMs, you’ve arrived :-)\n\nTempi works best when there’s a distinct “pulse” to the song, like a kick drum/snare or a repeating chord, and assumes the player is trying to play at a consistent tempo. With less structured music it still does quite well but may occasionally report incorrect tempos.\n\nIf your song is very fast or very slow, tap the button at the top right to toggle between 1/2x, 1x, and 2x tempos."

      "label": "Welcome to the ERSKN Afro-Cuban Essentials Play-Along app, featuring Aaron Serfaty. \n\nI have known Aaron for many years, and he is the “go-to” guy for Afro-Cuban and Brazilian drumming in Los Angeles. He is also my trusted colleague at the Thornton School at the University of Southern California. We are delighted to present this app to you. \n\nIt has been designed and created for use by all musicians who are interested in increasing their understanding of listening to Afro-Cuban music and raising the level of their skills and artistry when playing this music. \n\nThe heart of Afro-Cuban music is understanding clave and the role each instrument plays, all while being able to play the “standards” of this music in common keys and at different tempos. With the combined professional and pedagogical experiences between the three musicians, these tracks target and explore an essential variety of requisite Afro-Cuban modes and styles.\n\nUsing the built-in mixer, the user can create their own combo: full rhythm section (trio), music-minus- piano, music-minus-bass, music-minus-drums, or solo tracks of drums-only, bass-only or piano-only PLUS any combination of congas, bongo and timbale percussion tracks. There are click-track and count-off options, too.\n\nPDF lead sheets are included for the rhythm section. These charts can be printed or emailed from the app. There are also transcriptions of some of the piano montuno patterns as well as all of the relevant beats and patterns Aaron plays on a variety of instruments (drum set, congas, bongo and timbales, etc.)\n\nWe suggest you listen to the full band mixes at least once in order to hear how the musicians are playing this music — you now have a world-class Afro- Cuban rhythm section at your fingertips!\n\nI asked Aaron what he wanted to say in these introductory remarks, and this is what he told me: “I'd like you to insist on the fact that we don't need to be fluent in Spanish to play this music. Nurture Vs. Nature. No genetic code needed, just homework.”\n\nThere’s no better musical homework than listening and playing...and now, you can do both, any time and anywhere!\n\n-- Peter Erskine"

Tuner T1 Pro also comes with a handy Tone Generator that plays any musical note as reference for tuning. A must-have tool for musicians.\n\n• Simple to use with all the essential features.\n• Live pitch graph displays the exact pitch, note and deviation in realtime.\n• Extremely accurate (can be tuned to an accuracy of ±0.1 cents).\n• Tone generator that can generate reference tones over a note-range of 3 octaves.\n• Ability to set the frequency of A₄ (for tunings where A₄ is not 440 hertz).\n• Option to visualize pitch on piano keys.\r\n• Option to set detection latency - By setting a lower latency value, pitch detection will be faster. This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

      "label": "Chameleon is an AUv3 compatible sampler instrument plugin for your favourite DAW. \n\nThe program can run as a standalone app in order to record audio samples from the internal microphone or professional audio interface. It also supports incoming Inter-App Audio connections for sampling directly from other iOS applications, however it is primarily intended to be used as an AUv3 Instrument plugin for applications such as Cubasis, AUM, Auria, Meteor, Gargeband etc. The plugin can additionally be loaded as an AUv3 effect in order to record audio passing through it from other AUv3 Instrument sources, which makes it a very versatile and useful tool.\n\nSo what is a sampler? A sampler is a device that allows you to imitate other instruments with just a few short audio snippits. Although it comes with a library of presets it also allows you to create your own. You do this by recording multiple audio clips and mapping them to the notes on a MIDI keyboard and Chameleon does the rest using a sophisticated pitch shifting algorithm to fill in the blanks.  Recorded samples can either be layered or mapped freely over a 7 octave range and saved as individual presets. Presets are then organised into custom categorised banks which can be exported and shared with others.\n\nJust think, you can sample all your favourite synth sounds and carry them around on your iPhone/iPad without the inconvenience of lugging heavy gear around with you. Sample anything from musical instruments to vocal snippits, drum machines or ambient noises. The possibilities are endless.\n\nRecording is incredible easy. Just create a New Patch and press record. Chameleon will wait for you to play a note before recording begins. Once recorded press the LEARN button and tap the note range on the virtual or MIDI keyboard to map the sample. Repeat this as many times as required, tweak the settings and save your patch. Additionally you can setup loop points with the ability to apply crossfade. If all that sounds too complicated, just press auto sample and let Chameleon do all the sampling for you.\n\nChameleon also has a quite sophisticated arpeggiator which allows you to create complex mixtures of notes and chords with glide, hold and re-triggering options. \n\nOn board reverb, digital delay and chorus effects are available to give your samples a more polished touch. We also include 4 touch pads for quickly dialing in on a sound or for easy effect automation. Configurable touch ADSR and modulation options are available too.\n\nChameleon can also import audio samples using iOS Files integration or you can make use of Copy / Paste to quickly drop one of more samples into a patch. You can also freely edit samples using the built in tools such as normalise, fade in, fade out, crop, clear options etc. \n\nYou can run Cameleon as a standalone app and map external MIDI keyboards (Bluetooth MIDI support also included) and perform audio sampling outside of your DAW. This is provided for convenience since you can't record input when hosted as an AUv3 Instrument plugin.\n\nYes some DAW's have built in samplers which only have the ability to playback libraries provided with the software. Chameleon allows you to built your own libraries of sounds and share them with others. There's a budding rapper in you dying to get out and we have just the tool!\n\nFeatures:\n\nAUv3 Instrument and AUv3 Effect compatible\nRuns as a standalone app for sampling purposes.\nSupports incoming IAA connections to compatible apps..\nADSR touch envelopes and modulation.\nARP - Sophisticated programmable arpegiator.\nReverb, Chorus and Digital Delay Effects with BPM sync.\nBackup and Restore patches and banks.\nCreate your own user banks.\n4 Touch Pads for automation.\n16 MIDI Drum Pads\niOS Files App support for import and export.\nBluetooth MIDI support\nLoop Points and optional Crossfade supported.\nMonophonic and Polyphonic modes.\nAuto Sample feature.\nBuilt in Vocoder."

      "label": "MagicDelay is a professional, studio grade, spectral delay effect. Spectral because it allows the effect amount to be controlled per-frequency as if you had thousands of delays combined into one. Something not possible in the analogue world. Controlling thousands of delay times sounds complicated, but we made this process really simple. At the heart of MagicDelay is the Curve Editor where you can draw up to 4 separate curves and fluently morph between them using the adjacent XY pad. The final morphed curve can be inverted, shifted, and skewed for further creative control. The delay features two feedback types, control of the amount of feedback, and high and low pass filters.\n\nSync your delay times to your DAW when used in AUv3 supporting apps such as GarageBand is quick and easy. In just a few seconds you can have, for example, a regular eighth delay for the low-mids and a dotted eighth delay for the highs, or any other combination you can think of!\n\nA great delay needs a great modulation system. In the modulation panel tap on an empty modulation slot and get going. Tap the mapping button to enter mapping mode and choose which controls above should be modulated.\n\nRead our in-depth guides on our website for detailed descriptions of everything MagicDelay has to offer."

For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version.

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

      "label": "One of the first steps in ear training is recognizing intervals. Knowing what the distance is between two notes. Because every melody, chord or scale consists of a series of intervals, this is a very useful and also fundamental skill in music. \n\nThis app helps you to identify the intervals and at the same time how to find them on the guitar. \n\nWith an improved knowledge of intervals on the guitar you can figure out chord progressions more easily, can reproduce melodies as you hear them, get a better understanding of written music etc.\n\nFeatures\n\n- 17 selectable intervals, from unison, minor second thru major tenth.\n\n- Choice between melodic and harmonic intervals, ascending & descending.\n\n- A graphical representation of intervals on the guitar.\n\n- The root note can be chosen over two octaves.\n\n- Portrait, portrait upside down and both landscape modes.\n\n- Optional voice function, convenient for training in the car.\n\n- Practice and test (quiz)mode.\n\n- Intervals are grouped by difficulty level. Each group has 6 progress indicators corresponding to the different interval types  (melodic ascending/descending, harmonic ascending/descending, random melodic, random harmonic/melodic).\n\n- Optional reference melodies for each interval can be played. These should help in learning intervals faster.\n\n- In practicing harmonic intervals, the interval is classified as consonant/dissonant. Hearing this difference is beneficial in identifying harmonic intervals.\n\n- More than 10 alternate tunings e.g. the NST (new standard tuning) and all fourths tuning. The latter has the property that same intervals all have similar patterns down or across the fretboard.\n\n- Option to play only tapped notes (interval type \"None\"). Useful in figuring out melodies or trying alternate tunings. \n\n- In practice mode the root can also be played as the second note in the interval.\n\n- Support for left handed guitar.\n\n- Support for bass guitar.\n\n- To be in line with written music, enharmonic equivalent notes are used to have classical interval names. E.g. the 3 semitone interval C - D# will be called minor third C - Eb.\n\n- Intervals can be practiced and tested in a scale context. Sometimes the same intervals may sound quite different just because of being played in another scale. To strengthen the scale interval knowledge the partial scale runs of the interval can be played automatically backward and/or forward for a chosen scale.\n\n- More than 15 of the most important scales are implemented and can be visualized on the fretboard. The scale notes are clustered and colored to show clearly the root note for which the interval applies.\n\n- Universal app: designed for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, 64-bit compatible.\n\n- Support for all screen sizes.\n\n- Dark mode support.\n\n- iOS, iPadOS 16 tested."

      "label": "“Unique sounds like syrup with dirt kicked into it. If Bootsy Collins, Roger Troutman and Daft Punk would have met up in Studio 54 to create a soft-synth, for sure something like Unique would have come out of it…” Sound & Recording Mag\n\nUnique was made for fun and vibes: Analogue sound, intense modulation and a killer set of features, delivering an amazing sonic spectrum that’s full of character: Classy sounds, powerful, warm… sometimes gritty.\n\nEach of the 2 oscillators offers a selection of 5 waveforms: sawtooth and pulse waves are here, along with noise, triple saw and triple FM waves. There's also an additional sub-oscillator strapped into the master section for added oomph.\n\nThe internal controllers will bring in the dynamics: an LFO and an envelope, there's a recordable XY field & a sequencer. Use these to modulate any knob – a simple long tap will do.\n\nThe sound springs to life when it hits the filter section. Needless to say, analogue high-pass, low-pass and band-pass varieties are in place, along with a comb filter.\n\nStandards aside, the actual intention behind this project, the Vowel Filter, also became its outstanding feature: string together two or four vowel formants and play them back in a multitude of ways.\n\nOnce you’ve built your sound, there’s tons of sound polish in two chained multi-effect units.\n\nFeatures\n\n•\tSawtooth, Triple Saw, Pulse, Triple FM, Noise with tonal Filter, Sub Sine\n•\t5 Filters with 5 Modulators each\n•\tDuophone Arpeggiator\n•\tVowel Filter\n•\tTwo Effect Sections\n•      Audio Unit v3\n•\tAbleton Link Kit\n•\tMIDI Learn & Host Automation\n•\t300 groovy presets by various artists"

At small sizes those very same qualities can add an angelic sheen to vocals or turn a simple drum track into an otherworldly rhythm section.\n\nFeatures:\n- Incredibly easy to use with over 80 presets; many created by Eventide artists.\n- Ability to create extremely musical effects useful for highlighting key instruments.\n- Supernatural settings for abstract spatial effects and drones.\n- Subtle settings for ambient washes and track highlighting.\n- Unique “Gravity” control reverses the arrow of time by inverting the reverb's decay.\n- Innovative Ribbon and Hotswitch allow for changing any combination of parameters simultaneously.\n- Fully flexible mono and stereo options. Bring new realms of stereo imaging to mono instruments.\n- Mixlock allows for scrolling through presets or settings while keeping the wet/dry mix constant.\n- Available as an Audio Units AUv3 plug-in, Inter-App Audio, and Standalone App."

      "label": "Have you ever struggled to find confidence on stage or inspiration in the studio? AeroPads cues immersive pads and soundscapes that inspire and equip you to perform your very best every time.\n\nENHANCE YOUR SOUND. ENGAGE YOUR AUDIENCE.\nEvery musician has experienced an empty mix or an awkward transition. When using AeroPads, you instantly add more dimension and character to your sound. With a more immersive mix and the ability to perform smooth and seamless transitions, you will feel more confident while your audience will be more engaged.\n\nFOR EVERY MUSICIAN.\nPads and soundscapes are a versatile accompaniment to nearly any style of music. Whether you are a soloist or full band, AeroPads will take your sound to the next level. Rock bands, worship teams, wedding singers, producers, songwriters, and instrumentalists are just a few of the many types of musicians that have loved using AeroPads.\n\nDESIGNED FOR THE STAGE. INSPIRED BY SPACE.\nAeroPads features creative and immersive soundscapes paired with a beautiful and intuitive interface, all inspired by the pinnacle of exploration and inspiration: outer space.\n\nCREATIVITY THAT SPARKS CREATIVITY.\nAeroPads aren't your typical pads. Most pads out there are really boring or insanely obnoxious. However, AeroPads features thoughtfully crafted soundscapes that are meticulously fine-tuned with the perfect amount of harmonic and textural movement. Simply put, AeroPads won't step on the toes of your arrangement or get on the nerves of your sound guy (like most other pads out there).\n\n\nHighlighted Features:\n- A beautiful space-inspired interface with a simple and intuitive design.\n- Live View: Every key and three of your favorite patches are instantly accessible (best suited for experimentation, free-flowing sets, and songwriting).\n- Setlist View: Plan and build a detailed setlist (best suited for structured sets and seamless transitions).\n- The iconic Atmosphere Soundpack which includes five unique patches named after and inspired by the layers of Earth's atmosphere. \n- Three patches can be added to Live View to be made instantly accessible, so there's no need to dig through menus to just to change a patch when performing live.\n- Additional patches and soundpacks available for purchase.\n\n\nHow to Use:\n01. Cue a pad that matches the key of your musical arrangement.\n02. Play overtop of the accompanying pads and soundcapes.\n03. Enjoy the boost of audience engagement, musician confidence, and creative inspiration.\n\nPads and soundscapes are intended as a subtle accompaniment to musical arrangements/performances. They are designed to be cued according to the key of the arrangement. Once cued, you'll hear a droning pad centered around the root note with additional harmonic textures within the major scale. Pads can accompany arrangements of both minor and major scales. To accompany an arrangement within a minor scale, cue the relative major (Example: to accompany an arrangement in the key of A minor, cue \"C\"). A pad's key should not be changed to match chord changes within an arrangement. The only time a pad's key should change within a song is in the instance of a key change. For best results, mix AeroPads appropriately within the overall mix. When mixed too loud, AeroPads may compete with melodies and the arrangement. When mixed too quietly, AeroPads may be less effective. When mixed appropriately, they will sound awesome."

Play with your favorite external controller or directly from your iOS device through our intuitive interface.\n\nWith SWAM Violin for iOS you can:\n- Explore our collection of presets, create your own, or import them from your Desktop\n- Play in real-time using the standalone version of the app\n- Play with different instrument bodies\n- Play in a variety of styles like a real player\nControl the instrument’s expressivity in real-time directly through the touch control interface on your iPhone or iPad  including the exclusive virtual bowing touch surface!\n- Play and control the instrument’s expressivity in real-time using your favorite external controller (ROLI Seaboard, Akai EWI, breath controllers, regular keyboards, and more)\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version to produce music with a mobile setup\n- Use the included AUv3 plugin version in combination with Camelot PRO for live performances\n- Adjust every aspect of the instrument’s sound (timbre, vibrato, amount of air, etc.) through an easy-to-use control panel\n- Micro-tune the instrument through the Pitch Manager (note: MAQAM device is supported with direct integration)\n- Add built-in effects such as Reverb, EQ, and Compressor\n- Have access to easy MIDI control configurations\n\nThe SWAM Violin for iOS is for you if:\n- You’re a wind controller player looking for a mobile setup to perform live without needing a computer while still having an incredible sound.\n- You’re a keyboard player and feeling frustrated by the limited expressive capabilities normal sample-based plugins give you.\n- You’re a music producer looking for a mobile setup to produce music from anywhere without having to carry around expensive gear.\n- You’re looking for a virtual instrument that allows you to express the full range of your musicality easily  on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you choose to play using an external controller, please note that a controller with the ability to continuously control the expression (like an expression pedal, breath controller, MPE device, wind controller, …) is REQUIRED. The same way real players need a bow to express themself on their instrument, SWAM Violin needs something to control its expressivity. SWAM instruments do not work with just note-on velocity."

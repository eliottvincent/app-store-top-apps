      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time.

Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  \n\nOK!  Now what??\n\nDo you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do! Enable manual mode; set the focus to infinity; change the temperature to a certain number; change the ISO between certain values; change the shutter speed to something else....wait what...?\n\nDon't worry, this app does all of that for you so all you have to do is find those lights.  ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!\n\nWorth a shot !

All you need to do is drag, grow or shrink the body parts you want to distort. Find out how you would look like with a different nose, chin, buttock, less weight... \n\nOur app, downloaded 10 million times on all platforms worldwide stands out because of 2 particular features:\n\n1) The distortion algorithm we are using produce very smooth image distortions, such as the ones you find in 100x more expensive professional liquify apps. \n\n 2) Our dual display mode, which clones your image into the other half of the screen when you rotate your device, allows you to modify your image without the encumbrance of your finger hiding the area you are working on. This is ideal for small touch devices such as your phone !!\n\n- New Feature: You can now save morphing animations as videos! \n\n************************ \nWHAT CAN THE APP DO? \n************************ \n\nWith this photo distortion app you can transform any face and body part:\n\n• Nose reshaping\n• Lips augmentation \n• Chin and face contouring \n• Weight loss \n• Muscle augmentation \n• anything you can reshape or shrink! \n\nFor fun or simply because you are curious about how you would look with a differently shaped body part, this app will help you.\n\n\n************************ \nHOW TO USE THE APP? \n************************ \n\nUsing the app is very easy, even on small screens: \n\n• Import a head-shot or full body picture from your camera or device image library. Preferably the subject should be photographed on a unified color background and well lit, so the contours are clearly visible. \n\n• Use your finger to drag or shrink the body parts that you want distorted. For example you can crush this bump on your nose, or even make you slimmer. \n\n• Undo latest changes if you are not satisfied with latest modifications. \n\n• By rotating your device, switch from single to dual view, to easily compare the before / after images on the same screen. \n\n• Zoom in, and use the dual view to see your changes on a real time workspace mirror without your finger in the way. This is a great solution to perform precise distortions on small screens!! \n\n• Launch a morphing animation between the original photo and the modified one to see the old you transforming into the new you! \n\nDownload our app now. Then see how those changes you’ve been wanting to see might look."

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop.

      "label": "Obscura 3 is a camera app packed full of features to help you take incredible photos. Obscura pairs a stunning design with intuitive controls that make taking photos a delight.\n—\n\nObscura 2 has been featured numerous times by Apple around the world, including as Editor’s Choice and App of the Day. And Obscura 3 is even better.\n—\n\nDesign\n\nObscura squeezes a bunch of powerful features into simple controls anyone can master. The interface balances aesthetics, ergonomics, and intuitiveness. You won’t want to use anything else. All the camera controls can be reached with one thumb, and gestures and haptics combine to create a tactile experience that lets you stay focused on your subject.\n—\n\nAppearance\nThemes, manual light and dark modes, custom app icons. All gorgeous. \n—\n\n\nCamera Features\n—\n\nModes\nObscura 3 has been designed around 5 distinct camera modes: \nPhoto - simple, fast performance\nPro Photo - maximum control \nDepth - portraits & depth data\nLive Photo - for.. Live Photos\nVideo - video capture with pro controls\n\nExposure\nTo adjust exposure, just touch your thumb to the Exposure Button and move it in a circle, like turning a dial. Couldn’t be simpler and it feels great. And you can just tap the button to instantly reset the exposure bias.\n\nFocus\nJust like exposure, drag your thumb around the Focus Button to focus manually. And you’ll get both a focus loupe and focus peaking to help you get your subject perfectly crisp. ^1\n\nISO & Shutter Speed\nTK\n\nWhite Balance\nAWB, White Point, Scene Presets, and manual Temp + Tint.\n\nPhoto Formats\nProRAW ^2, RAW, HEIC, and JPEG photos, Live Photos and Depth Data ^3. \n\nVideo Formats\n1080p or 4K at 24,30 or 60fps ^4\n\nFilters\nLots of new filters, some old favorites. You can now disable filters and set favorites for quick access. All included.\n\nAspect Ratio\nCapture photos in 4:3, 1:1, 16:9, and 2:1 aspect ratios.\n\nHistogram\nSmall or large, luminance or color.\n\nGrid\nLines, crosshairs, or none.\n\nSpirit Level\nFor perfectly level horizons that would make Wes Anderson proud.\n\nFlash\nYep.\n\nTimer\nI hear tick tock is really popular with the youths.\n\nPresets\nCustomise Obscura to your heart’s content, and save those customisations into presets to quickly access at any time.\n—\n \nLibrary\n\nNot only has the camera interface been redesigned, but the library has been reconsidered from the ground up to give you quick access to your most important photos, without sacrificing performance.\n—\n\nView Options\nObscura lets you configure exactly what’s displayed in the library views, so you can hide screenshots and memes to help you focus on your photos.\n\nYou can also adjust the size of thumbnails to suit your preference. And keep hidden photos hidden. Naturally.\n—\n\nImage View & Editing\nBrowse, share, fav, rate, edit. Whether you want to dig into metadata, triage through your vacation photos, or apply some cool filters, you’ll find it here.\n—\n\n\nSettings & More\nObscura’s Settings has a bunch of options, allowing you to manage filters, tweak camera behaviours, change the theme, read the walkthrough and more.\n—\n\nApple Watch Support\nUse your Apple Watch as a camera remote. You can change capture mode, set exposure and more!\n—\n\nGame Controller Support (Beta)\nIt’s a little rough, but yes, you can use a game controller to control your camera.\n———\n\n\n1. Manual Focus only available in single camera modes, not while using a Virtual Dual or Triple camera. Yes, this sucks but the virtual cameras are weird and full of quirks\n2. ProRAW only available on iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro\n3. Depth Data only available on Dual, Triple, or TrueDepth Camera systems\n4. Video formats vary by device\n\nThanks for checking out Obscura. If you decide to buy, we hope you’ll consider rating it, or sharing with someone you think might like it. \n\nAll the best,\nBen & Adam"

Please try the free app version to check if your specific DLNA player is supported.\n\nMp4, m3u8, hls live streaming, video over https and of course Full HD are supported. And there is no time limit at all! Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for video link detection and send the video with a single tap to your DLNA player. The discovered link is shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. \n\n* The app only works with a DLNA player that is capable of \"media rendering\". \n\n* Sony Bravia TVs: Please enable the renderer function of your TV to enable casting. See http://bit.ly/1VKM60A\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please use the hardware remote of your DLNA player to forward, rewind and pause a running video.\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to try it multiple times until it works on your specific DLNA player.\n\n* If a video does not cast, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. FAQ did not help? Please drop us a mail and give us the chance to help you before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can enable/disable it at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Add and manage as many bookmarks as you want, either in the bookmarks menu or directly in the browser.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: After purchasing this you can set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nPlease note that this app may not work with all DLNA devices out there. But we are working hard to improve this app with every update. Your feedback will drive our work ahead and you'll see improvements and new features in the next update.

      "label": "Designed by a photographer for photographers, focused on RELIABILITY and PRECISION for digital and analog photography.\n\n• Extended sensitivity as low as -2/-4EV (dark scenes)\n\n• Two different convenient interface designs.\n\n• Incident and reflected light metering modes.\n\n• Save exposure data.\n\n• f/Tools connection.\n\n• Independent calibration for the two metering modes.\n\n• Independent selection of aperture, speed, ISO and exposure compensation with 1/3 resolution. From 4 minutes to 1/8000 sec., aperture from 1.0 to 512 and iso from 3 to 6400.\n\n• Automatic priority for aperture or speed. (Automatic Av and Tv modes).\n\n• Automatic ISO or locked ISO options.\n\n• Point metering in camera view.\n\n• Maximum aperture limited by the selected lens.\n\n• Calculate the average of any number of measurements you want.\n\n• Read the exposure data of any photo from the gallery.\n\n• Calculate hyperfocal distance for 5 memorized lenses. Which also blocks maximum aperture.\n\n• Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.\n\n• Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light. (IR button)\n\n• Exposure value EV on an analog scale or right up front.\n\n• Two LED indicators show whether the measurement is unreliable due to lack of light in the scene, or if we have under 30% battery left.\n\n• On 3.5 \" displays preset lens buttons tilting the device or tapping at the bottom.\n\n• Be advised that accurate incident light reading needs a diffuser attached to the front camera. Without the diffuser still can be used but think about it, it will be a reflected reading taken with the front camera.\n\nI'm an independent photographer/designer/developer and am very grateful for your support. Trying to do the best lightmeter app ever, a lot more to come. You can ask for any improvement and I'll be happy to help. This app is constantly reviewed and improved because it is my tool, if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me by email at davidquiles@me.com\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid Quiles"

      "label": "Watch webvideos, online movies, live tv streams and your personal photos, videos & music on your Amazon Fire TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any video you want on your Amazon Fire TV (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!"

      "label": "DoubleTake by Filmic transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll."

Instead of spending all that time setting up your big camera, just choose your desired film/sensor size and focal length in the app and point the iPhone camera at what you want to photo to verify framing. If you are happy with the framing then you can get the big camera out. The app has a large database of camera sensors details and film formats but if the format you desire isn’t there you can add your own custom format. The app is targeted at stills photographers or film makers working in either film or digital. If you don’t have your big camera with you, Viewfinder Preview is still great for photo sketching, location scouting or story boarding.\n\nThe app includes\n\n- Customisable menus so you can include the film/sensor formats and focal lengths you care about.\n- A fully configurable light meter.\n- You can take photos with it, so you have a record of shots you were framing.\n- Photos taken with the app include additional data that describe the film format, focal length and lighting meter settings at the time the shot was taken\n- Add notes to your photos\n- A photo gallery for viewing photos taken with the app which also displays the additional data\n- Share images in emails, messages\n- Create albums of photos from the same project, trip etc\n- Create PDF documents of albums\n- Film stock emulation\n- Wide angle lens adapter support"

      "label": "The Gudak Cam has been designed to focus on long-term memory, reminiscence. It is recalling the images you took 72 hours later, when 80% of your memory has blurred and faded away, will turn your short-term memory into long-term memory. Our team also has attempted to reproduce the in-the-moment experience of taking photos by eliminating the Instant Review feature found on conventional digital cameras and reducing 95 % of the conventional viewfinder feature, leaving only the bare minimum needed for taking shots.\n\n\"Gudak-dari Camera\", as its name suggests, refers to a time-worn and antique camera. Living in a digital generation where \"Un-do\" function is prevalent, we may have lost\n\nthe thrill of making new and conscious decisions. \"Patients is a virtue\" has faded its original value and people are getting used to selecting one palatable photo out of a myriad of photos. Amid this so-called \"digitalization\", we hope you to recall the thrill of making new choices by seizing the \"Gudak Moment\".\n\nGudak 3.2 Update has added a self-camera feature that allows you to shoot with a front camera as Gudak feels.\nExperience a new look of Gudak and a variety of emotional photos with front cameras as well as rear cameras. The theme will be updated further in the future.\n\n*The Lecoq film is only available in Korea.\n\nAlso, for those who feel that Gudak photos are dark, you can adjust the brightness of photos through the newly added ISO (based on world standard film sensitivity).\n\nA Gudakbook icon has been added to make Gudak photos a real album. Try to experience the feeling of those days through Gudakbook like the excitement I felt when printing the film camera. You can apply for Gudakbook through the print icon on the Printed Envelope Check page.\n\n\n[Explanation of Authority ]\n\nEssential access authority\n- Cameras: Camera access for photography\n- Save: External Storage Read/Write permissions for photoshooting, storing, and bringing in\n\nSelective access\n* You can use the service without agreeing to access rights.\n- Location: Location access to tag location information in pictures"

Painted for you in real time! Participate or spectate it's up to you, Oilist will delight! All saved at canvas-worthy 4k resolution.\n​\nOilist comes with 48 infinitely customizable styles; from photo-realist to impressionist, to abstract. Every style except for our photo-realist style offers three different levels of abstraction.\n\nOilist is not a photo filter. Unlike most filter apps, Oilist will never generate the same results twice, and in fact, each brush stroke is unique. Instead of applying a fixed formula to an image as photo filters typically do, Oilist analyzes the supplied image using computer vision technology, then paints simulated paint particles that are applied using various brush strokes and techniques.\n\nAt any time​ during the painting process, 4k resolution images may be captured as often as desired. \n\nWhen Oilist is painting, styles can be infinitely customized with 17 different presets (these were called Styles in previous versions of Oilist), 13 different painting moods, 15 different brushes, setting brush options such as the size and spacing, and by splashing paint with our exciting Chaos tool. Control paint gravity by tilting your device and brush angles by yawing (rotating) the device. \n\nObtain new and exciting results by alternating settings with new settings painted on top of the previous settings. For instance, first, paint a layer using the Warm mood followed by a layer using the Cool mood. The use of large brushes tend to create more abstract artwork, and smaller brushes work best for high definition detail.\n\nOilist will automatically provide smaller brush strokes and greater photo-realism to detected faces. \n\nCheck out #oilist and follow us @3dtopo on Instagram and Twitter!"

Make sure you have the controls you need with the native app, and that image quality and lag are acceptable. Contact me if you have any questions.\n\n• FieldMonitor has the same latency, resolution, and reliability as your camera’s native app.\n\n• If a camera control or feature does not work with the native app, it won’t work with FieldMonitor. \n\n• FieldMonitor has NO playback, review or download capability.\n\n• In areas with busy Wi-Fi networks and/or sources of radio interference, performance cannot be guaranteed, whether using FieldMonitor or your camera’s native app.\n\nWHAT IT DOES:\n\nFieldMonitor™ lets you monitor picture, exposure, and color on supported Canon™, Panasonic™, and Sony™ cameras, and Teradek™ H.264 transmitters (Teradeks require iOS 10+). FieldMonitor runs on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple Silicon (M1) Mac.\n\nUse markers to show safe areas, aspect ratios, and framing grids. Desqueeze anamorphic images, cropped to your final aspect ratio. Flip the image on either axis. Focus Assist helps you nail focus (camera sources only). Use a waveform monitor, vectorscope, histogram, and/or false color. Add 3D LUTs (camera sources only).\n\nWith iPhone 5S or later, iPod touch 6G or later, iPad Air or later, iPad mini 2 or later, and iPad Pro, you can see a false-color picture with adjustable levels.\n\nWith a supported camera and lens you can start/stop recording, control exposure and color settings, and zoom or focus remotely. Controls are designed for fast, realtime adjustments.\n\nSee the FieldMonitor website for details.\n\nSUPPORTED SOURCES:\n\n• Canon: EOS mirrorless and DSLR cameras that support video recording in Wi-Fi remote mode when using Canon’s Camera Connect.\n\n• Panasonic: Lumix cameras that transmit a live view while recording when using Image App or Lumix Sync.

A5000, A6000, A7, A7R, A99 and earlier cameras do NOT support video recording in Wi-Fi remote mode.\n\n• Teradek: H.264 streams only, not H.265/HEVC (Cube 700/800) or uncompressed (Bolt).\n\n• More info on the FieldMonitor website’s support page.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n\n• FieldMonitor does not work with cine cameras or camcorders, only “hybrid” still & video cameras (mirrorless or DSLR).\n\n• Audio is not transmitted from cameras, only Teradeks.\n\n• Camera Wi-Fi images are 512x288, 640x360, 320x180, or 1024x576 depending on the camera. Teradeks support 720p and 1080p.\n\n• “Smart Remote” Sonys do NOT allow use of Picture Profiles, S-Log, or S&Q Motion when using Wi-Fi remote control. Focus points can only be set in photo mode.\n\n• “Ctrl w/ Smartphone“ Sonys do not display focus area, battery level, and/or storage info. Focus points can’t be set in the app with most cameras other than A1, A7Siii, and FX3, in video mode only.\n\n• Fujifilm legacy support: ONLY X-T3 and X-T100 are supported. X-T3 only records 1080p / 29.97 fps; X-T100 only records 720p / 24 fps.

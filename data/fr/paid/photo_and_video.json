      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.\n \nSlow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:\n \nMOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.\n\nLIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all LG Smart TVs. \n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad.

You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with LG Electronics or any other trademark mentioned here."

Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your TV or gaming console. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Google Cast enabled device immediately.

If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast.

Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google, Sony, Philips, Vizio, Sharp, Asus, Nvidia or one of their products and trademarks."

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!! And you designed it work easily and quickly\"\nRyan, England\n\n“I looooove your app. It has taken my Chromecast to a whole new level.”\nRosalind Romero, USA\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "Watch webvideos, online movies, live tv streams and your personal photos, videos & music on your DLNA powered TV, video game console or blu-ray player. Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nBrowse the web and stream your favorite webvideo or online TV show on a DLNA player like Samsung TV, LG TV, Sony TV, Philips TV, Toshiba TV, Panasonic TV, Xbox 360, Xbox One, EZCast, WD TV, Kodi (XBMC), SONOS and many other devices that use DLNA / UPnP / AllShare. Please try the free app version to check if your specific DLNA player is supported.\n\nMp4, m3u8, hls live streaming, video over https and of course Full HD are supported. And there is no time limit at all! Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for video link detection and send the video with a single tap to your DLNA player. The discovered link is shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. \n\n* The app only works with a DLNA player that is capable of \"media rendering\". \n\n* Sony Bravia TVs: Please enable the renderer function of your TV to enable casting. See http://bit.ly/1VKM60A\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please use the hardware remote of your DLNA player to forward, rewind and pause a running video.\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to try it multiple times until it works on your specific DLNA player.\n\n* If a video does not cast, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. FAQ did not help? Please drop us a mail and give us the chance to help you before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can enable/disable it at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Add and manage as many bookmarks as you want, either in the bookmarks menu or directly in the browser.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: After purchasing this you can set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nPlease note that this app may not work with all DLNA devices out there. But we are working hard to improve this app with every update. Your feedback will drive our work ahead and you'll see improvements and new features in the next update. Please send your feedback to info@video-tv-cast.com\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with the Digital Living Network Alliance or any other trademark mentioned here."

From 4 minutes to 1/8000 sec., aperture from 1.0 to 512 and iso from 3 to 6400.\n\n• Automatic priority for aperture or speed. (Automatic Av and Tv modes).\n\n• Automatic ISO or locked ISO options.\n\n• Point metering in camera view.\n\n• Maximum aperture limited by the selected lens.\n\n• Calculate the average of any number of measurements you want.\n\n• Read the exposure data of any photo from the gallery.\n\n• Calculate hyperfocal distance for 5 memorized lenses. Which also blocks maximum aperture.\n\n• Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.\n\n• Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light. (IR button)\n\n• Exposure value EV on an analog scale or right up front.\n\n• Two LED indicators show whether the measurement is unreliable due to lack of light in the scene, or if we have under 30% battery left.\n\n• On 3.5 \" displays preset lens buttons tilting the device or tapping at the bottom.\n\n• Be advised that accurate incident light reading needs a diffuser attached to the front camera. Without the diffuser still can be used but think about it, it will be a reflected reading taken with the front camera.\n\nI'm an independent photographer/designer/developer and am very grateful for your support. Trying to do the best lightmeter app ever, a lot more to come. You can ask for any improvement and I'll be happy to help.

      "label": "Reeflex is the best photography app on the App Store designed for enthusiasts, creatives, and professional photographers! The app provides pro-level DSLR features directly on your iPhone while being intuitive and easy to use in every situation.\r\n\r\n--- Professional Tools for Everyone ---\r\n\r\nReeflex offers a rich set of professional tools for full manual control over focus, exposure, and white balance. The live histograms combined with the zebra stripes allow you to precisely monitor your exposure. The focus peaking is a powerful guide for adjusting the focus over your subject. By a simple two-finger tap on the viewfinder, Reeflex also offers the possibility to independently adjust focus and exposure, moving two convenient reticles across the scene.  \r\n\r\nReeflex allows shooting in HEIF, JPG, TIFF, or RAW on all iPhone models. For compatible devices, you can also shoot in the Apple ProRAW format. \r\n\r\n--- Slow Shutter Mode --- \r\n\r\nReeflex offers the best long exposure tools on the App Store. Enjoy the flexibility of manual controls and watch the picture forming on the screen. Select either motion blur or light trails to make people disappear, give moving water a smooth silky appearance, or capture the movement of the night sky for stunning star trails. It has never been easier, the only limit is your creativity. \r\n\r\nOnly a few days after its launch, Reeflex was listed as “Must Have APPS - You Never Heard About!” by the highly popular iReviews YouTube channel. Check out the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M2PjNFbIjM\r\n\r\n--- MAIN FEATURES ---\n\r\n• Motion blur\r\n• Light trails\r\n• Wide range of selectable exposure duration, from 0.5 s to 2 hours.\r\n• Bulb mode for custom exposure duration\r\n• Full manual controls over ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance\r\n• Focus and exposure reticles \r\n• Luma and RGB zebra stripes\r\n• Live RGB and luma histograms \r\n• Advanced focus peaking \r\n• Support for multiple cameras\r\n• Apple’s ProRAW* and RAW** support\r\n• JPEG, HEIF, or TIFF as processed formats\r\n• GPS location in photos’ metadata\r\n• Gyroscopic tiltmeter\r\n\r\n--- ADDITIONAL FEATURES --- \r\n\r\n• Extended digital zoom up to 10x. \r\n• Integrated camera roll.\r\n• Customization of focus peaking color\r\n• Tutorials, tips, and detailed explanations in the settings section.\r\n\r\n--- WHAT'S COMING NEXT --- \r\n\r\nWe are working hard to include more advanced features such as:\r\n• RAW long exposures\r\n• Hand-held long exposures\r\n• Time-lapse, intervalometer, and bracketing\r\n\r\n--- REMARKS ---\r\n\r\n*ProRAW is only supported on iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 pro max. On other devices, when RAW mode is selected, photos will be saved in the Bayer RAW format. RAW mode requires an iPhone 6s or later.\r\n**On devices older than the iPhone 12, the RAW format is not supported on the ultrawide camera.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for new updates!\r\nWe'd love to hear from you and get your feedback. If you have any ideas on new features or improvements, please email us at info@reeflexstore.com."

Our team also has attempted to reproduce the in-the-moment experience of taking photos by eliminating the Instant Review feature found on conventional digital cameras and reducing 95 % of the conventional viewfinder feature, leaving only the bare minimum needed for taking shots.\n\n\"Gudak-dari Camera\", as its name suggests, refers to a time-worn and antique camera. Living in a digital generation where \"Un-do\" function is prevalent, we may have lost\n\nthe thrill of making new and conscious decisions. \"Patients is a virtue\" has faded its original value and people are getting used to selecting one palatable photo out of a myriad of photos. Amid this so-called \"digitalization\", we hope you to recall the thrill of making new choices by seizing the \"Gudak Moment\".\n\nGudak 3.2 Update has added a self-camera feature that allows you to shoot with a front camera as Gudak feels.\nExperience a new look of Gudak and a variety of emotional photos with front cameras as well as rear cameras. The theme will be updated further in the future.\n\n*The Lecoq film is only available in Korea.\n\nAlso, for those who feel that Gudak photos are dark, you can adjust the brightness of photos through the newly added ISO (based on world standard film sensitivity).\n\nA Gudakbook icon has been added to make Gudak photos a real album. Try to experience the feeling of those days through Gudakbook like the excitement I felt when printing the film camera. You can apply for Gudakbook through the print icon on the Printed Envelope Check page.\n\n\n[Explanation of Authority ]\n\nEssential access authority\n- Cameras: Camera access for photography\n- Save: External Storage Read/Write permissions for photoshooting, storing, and bringing in\n\nSelective access\n* You can use the service without agreeing to access rights.\n- Location: Location access to tag location information in pictures"

      "label": "DoubleTake by Filmic transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll."

      "label": "Obscura 3 is a camera app packed full of features to help you take incredible photos. Obscura pairs a stunning design with intuitive controls that make taking photos a delight.\n—\n\nObscura 2 has been featured numerous times by Apple around the world, including as Editor’s Choice and App of the Day. And Obscura 3 is even better.\n—\n\nDesign\n\nObscura squeezes a bunch of powerful features into simple controls anyone can master. The interface balances aesthetics, ergonomics, and intuitiveness. You won’t want to use anything else. All the camera controls can be reached with one thumb, and gestures and haptics combine to create a tactile experience that lets you stay focused on your subject.\n—\n\nAppearance\nThemes, manual light and dark modes, custom app icons. All gorgeous. \n—\n\n\nCamera Features\n—\n\nModes\nObscura 3 has been designed around 5 distinct camera modes: \nPhoto - simple, fast performance\nPro Photo - maximum control \nDepth - portraits & depth data\nLive Photo - for.. Live Photos\nVideo - video capture with pro controls\n\nExposure\nTo adjust exposure, just touch your thumb to the Exposure Button and move it in a circle, like turning a dial. Couldn’t be simpler and it feels great. And you can just tap the button to instantly reset the exposure bias.\n\nFocus\nJust like exposure, drag your thumb around the Focus Button to focus manually. And you’ll get both a focus loupe and focus peaking to help you get your subject perfectly crisp. ^1\n\nISO & Shutter Speed\nTK\n\nWhite Balance\nAWB, White Point, Scene Presets, and manual Temp + Tint.\n\nPhoto Formats\nProRAW ^2, RAW, HEIC, and JPEG photos, Live Photos and Depth Data ^3. \n\nVideo Formats\n1080p or 4K at 24,30 or 60fps ^4\n\nFilters\nLots of new filters, some old favorites. You can now disable filters and set favorites for quick access. All included.\n\nAspect Ratio\nCapture photos in 4:3, 1:1, 16:9, and 2:1 aspect ratios.\n\nHistogram\nSmall or large, luminance or color.\n\nGrid\nLines, crosshairs, or none.\n\nSpirit Level\nFor perfectly level horizons that would make Wes Anderson proud.\n\nFlash\nYep.\n\nTimer\nI hear tick tock is really popular with the youths.\n\nPresets\nCustomise Obscura to your heart’s content, and save those customisations into presets to quickly access at any time.\n—\n \nLibrary\n\nNot only has the camera interface been redesigned, but the library has been reconsidered from the ground up to give you quick access to your most important photos, without sacrificing performance.\n—\n\nView Options\nObscura lets you configure exactly what’s displayed in the library views, so you can hide screenshots and memes to help you focus on your photos.\n\nYou can also adjust the size of thumbnails to suit your preference. And keep hidden photos hidden. Naturally.\n—\n\nImage View & Editing\nBrowse, share, fav, rate, edit. Whether you want to dig into metadata, triage through your vacation photos, or apply some cool filters, you’ll find it here.\n—\n\n\nSettings & More\nObscura’s Settings has a bunch of options, allowing you to manage filters, tweak camera behaviours, change the theme, read the walkthrough and more.\n—\n\nApple Watch Support\nUse your Apple Watch as a camera remote. You can change capture mode, set exposure and more!\n—\n\nGame Controller Support (Beta)\nIt’s a little rough, but yes, you can use a game controller to control your camera.\n———\n\n\n1. Manual Focus only available in single camera modes, not while using a Virtual Dual or Triple camera. Yes, this sucks but the virtual cameras are weird and full of quirks\n2. ProRAW only available on iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro\n3. Depth Data only available on Dual, Triple, or TrueDepth Camera systems\n4. Video formats vary by device\n\nThanks for checking out Obscura. If you decide to buy, we hope you’ll consider rating it, or sharing with someone you think might like it. \n\nAll the best,\nBen & Adam"

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any video you want on your Amazon Fire TV (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Fire TV.\n\n* Supported Fire TVs: Fire TV Box+Stick, Fire TV Cube and all other devices of the Fire TV Family.\n\n* Supported TVs: Insignia TV and Toshiba TV with Fire TV Edition\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Fire TV must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here. This app was not created or endorsed by Amazon."

      "label": "Works great on iOS 11 and iPhone X! Thanks to users for the 1441 ***** 5 star reviews on iTunes! The essential Watermarking App for Professionals, Business and Personal Use. Easily, secure and protect your photos with a text, graphic, signature or QR watermark. Adding a visible watermark to a photo displays it is created and owned by you. Watermarking is increasingly important and is like signing your name to an image. A watermark subtly displays, no matter where your photo goes, that it's yours. Watermarking can also be used to add your email, url, a personal message or fun graphics to any photo or Pokemon Go screenshot.\n\n\"It's by far the best watermarking App I've seen to date on iOS.\"\n- Terry White, review on bestappsite.com\n\nVideo Review by the Daily App Show:\nhttp://dailyappshow.com/iwatermark\n\nThanks to all iWatermark users for the great reviews, feedback and suggestions. \n\niWatermark, is the only watermarking tool available for all 4 platforms iPhone/iPad, Mac and Windows. iWatermark is the most popular professional watermarking tool for photos.\n\nSocial media sharing at full resolution to Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Twitter, Camera Album, Clipboard or Email (3 resolution options).\n\nFeatures\n\n  * Touch gestures.\n     ** Click to move the watermark location.\n     ** Pinch/zoom to expand/contract the size of the watermark. \n     ** Two fingers at once to rotate the watermark to any angle.\n  * Batch processing (all at once) or sequential.\n  * Easily adjust the watermarks scale, opacity, font, color, size, position and angle.\n  * Create your own subtle text or graphic watermarks or select from the included example watermarks (both text and graphics).\n  * Included examples are both text (names, dates, tag data, etc.) and graphic (signatures, logos, etc.) watermarks which can be used immediately. \n  * 162 fonts for your text watermarks 112 + 50 iOS fonts.\n  * Displays each font.\n  * 34 high-res watermarks.\n  * Import your own graphic watermarks by sending yourself an email with attached graphic.\n  * One button import of your signature for use as a watermark.\n  * Complete and easy to understand manual.\n  * Create a QR watermark which is like a barcode. QR codes can contain up to 4000 chars of information. QR codes can then be read with a scanner or smartphone with the right app revealing the info you encoded. \n\nWhy Watermark?\n\nDigitally sign your photos/artwork with iWatermark to claim, secure and maintain your intellectual property and reputation.\n\n- Photos go viral then they fly off globally. Watermark with name, email or url so your photo has a visible and legal connection to you.\n- Build your company brand, by having your company logo on all your images.\n- Promote your company, name and website by using QR codes as watermarks.\n- Avoid the surprise of seeing your photos and/or artwork elsewhere on the web or in an ad.\n- Avoid the conflicts, costly litigation and headaches from plagiarists who claim they didn't know that you created it.\n- Avoid intellectual property (IP) squabbles.\n\nQ:I want to stamp my signature as my watermark. How do I add my graphic signature like the examples, Picasso, Ben Franklin, etc.? \nA:Use our signature tool or make the .png graphics on your computer, email it to yourself, open the email on your iOS device and save to your photo album. In iWatermark create a graphic watermark and choose the graphic from your photo album to add it as a new watermark.\n\nQ:Will it work with Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus?\nA:Yes\n\nSee the manual for more details:\nhttp://www.plumamazing.com/iphone/iwatermark-iphone/iwatermarkhelp/\n\nIMPORTANT: The signatures of John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Galileo are just examples of graphic watermarks. They are the real signatures of these historic people. They are there as examples to show what is possible. We recommend you create your own signature, logo or QR code watermarks.\n\nContact us if you need help or have a suggestion."

Whether you’re planning a photo shoot, a wedding, or a solar panel installation, tracking the sun and moon has never been easier!\n\nLumos is divided into six main modules:\n\n• The augmented reality view harnesses the power of AR to visually project past, present, or future sun and moon positions (and moon phases!) onto your surroundings, letting you perfectly visualize your plans.\n\n• The map view overlays the sun and moon positions for a given time and location onto a map of that location, letting you make plans from afar.\n\n• The Street View mode works like the AR view, but it takes advantage of Google Street View to allow you to envision sun and moon positions for remote locations (requires Lumos Pro).\n\n• The calendar view displays a simple list of rise/set times and moon phases throughout the year, letting you see the big picture at a glance. Tap a row to see the detailed ephemeris for that day.\n\n• The notifications module lets you sign up to receive notifications for significant solar and lunar events, including: astronomical, nautical, and civil dawn/dusk, blue hour, golden hour, sunrise/set, solar noon, moon rise/set, lunar transit, and lunar perigee/apogee (requires Lumos Pro).\n\n• The shadow length view calculates the exact length of the shadow an object will cast on a given time and day, letting you see the result both visually and numerically. You can also calculate the height of an object if you know the length of its shadow.\n\n\nWith an affordable one-time purchase of Lumos Pro, you can also:\n\n• Search for a location by name or manually enter coordinates\n\n• Save locations for later reference or offline use*\n\n• Take notes on a saved location and have them readily available the next time you view it\n\n\n*The map view and Street View do not currently support offline use\n\nNOTE: The sun and moon positions calculated by Lumos are accurate to within a small fraction of a degree. However, as with any augmented-reality app, the accuracy of the projection is dependent on the underlying hardware. If you are seeing inaccurate positions, please calibrate your device's compass and ensure that you are not near any sources of electromagnetic interference (e.g. microwaves, computers, car engines, high voltage lines). Phone cases containing batteries are known to cause compass interference. You can also use the visual calibration tool to align the projection with sun’s current position. Please feel free to contact us if you continue to have issues.\n\n_____________\n\nTerms of Use: https://termsfeed.com/terms-use/c5bcd4de47ffe3020e8aebd04a91af68\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/8042948/full-legal"

Shoot brighter and clearer night videos with the power of NeuralCam’s AI Video Engine.\r\n\r\nUsing proprietary AI denoising, frame boosting and brightening technology NeuralCam NightVideo is the only dedicated video night mode camera app for iPhones. \r\n\r\nMULTIPLE CAPTURE SETTINGS:\r\n\r\n- Time-lapse - a Night Time-lapse mode, for devices that don’t have one built in. This mode doesn’t record sound and can handle even the lowest light situations, which combined with a faster playback, it generates a specific night mode time-lapse look. \r\n\r\n- Night - the default mode for shooting night videos. It uses a slightly longer exposure time, that combined with our denoising and frame interpolation algorithms generates a bright, clean and smooth night video. This is the mode to use for most night scenes. \r\n\r\n- Dusk - This mode is designed for semi-low light and indoor shots. It is similar to Day mode, shot at a high frame rate to maintain sharp subjects in high movement situations, but it also includes a bit of additional brightening.\r\n\r\n- Day - Is targeted at lower light day shots, or scenes with high dynamic range where the results of the default iPhone camera start to get too noisy. This mode contains no brightening, but because of the use of our AI denoising algorithm resulting videos have a cleaner, more pleasant look. It’s especially useful when used with the ultra wide camera, in the case of which noise can appear even in medium-lit indoor situations.\r\n\r\nGENTLE LIGHT- each of the modes can be combined with the “gentle light” feature, where the app turns on the flashlight, but at one of the lowest levels in order to keep the resulting video still \r\nnatural and avoid “blinding” people. Gentle Light can be used in totally dark scenes with subjects that are close enough to be illuminated.\r\n\r\nCUSTOM BRIGHTENING - allows changing the brightness level to generate night videos with different look and feel.\r\n\r\nON-DEVICE PROCESSING - all this processing runs in real-time on the iPhone, making full use of the NeuralEngine's power. This means that none of your videos leave the device and we can provide the same instant video capturing experience you’re used to with your default camera. \r\n\r\n\r\nSupported devices and settings:\r\n\r\niPhone XS/XR and newer (A12 chip or newer, with Neural Engine) - 4 recording modes, using all Neural Engine-based solutions.\r\niPhone 6s to iPhone 8 Plus (A11 chip or older, without Neural Engine) - NightMode TimeLapse mode fully supported. All other modes will have varied frame rate and performance, based on the iPhone model.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerms of Use: https://neural.cam/terms.html"

It takes the edge off of skin and makeup problems that can be visible with HD video. Realistically and quickly applying digital makeup that makes your talent look great, without making them look airbrushed or blurry. Making for happy talent and producers. \n\nBeauty Video Filter app automatically identifies the skin tones and removes imperfections, like digital makeup, while leaving important facial details sharp. You no longer have to manually create masks or retouch frame by frame. Beauty Video Filter app is a powerful tool for any production that requires people to look their best.\n\n\nLose 10 years in 1 minute\n\nBeauty Video Filter app is simple and automatic to use. This video app uses face detection to automatically identify skin tones and create a mask that limits the smoothing effect to just the skin areas. This automatic process is designed to speed up the workflow that is usually required for skin retouching in film. The mask that is created will generally not need any adjustment. \n\nGreat features in Beauty Video Filter app:\n\nBetter Masking: We're now using multiple algorithms to determine what the skin tone is. This creates a much better mask, and better retouching as a result.\nFaster Rendering: A complete rewrite of the skin smoothing algorithm means Beauty Video Filter app  is faster on OpenGL cards.\nShine Removal: Get rid of hot spots caused by shiny skin and bright lights! This feature dramatically reduces the effect of poor lighting conditions."

Then process them with your favorite photogrammetry software (Metashape Pro, WebODM, Pix4D, Drone Deploy, MapsMadeEasy, SimActive etc) to get orthomosaic maps, digital terrain and elevation models (DTM, DEM).\n - Automatic flight planning based on camera parameters, overlaps and altitude\n - Estimates for GSD, flight time, number of photos and batteries\n - Multiple flights for massive areas\n - Custom start/finish positions\n - Pause mission and move backwards to retake some photos\n - Automatic takeoff or start mission after manual takeoff \n - Plan beforehand and try any DJI drone and camera to fit your mission\n - Land, hover or return after flight\n - Go Home on connection loss or continue mission (Spark, Mini and Air 2 do not support connectionless mode)\n\n* Waypoints Mission *\nFor smooth and repeatable time-lapse videos and photos (even seasonal time-lapse), photo reports from the same exact positions, search and rescue operations, aerial monitoring and video surveillance.\nTap desired locations to draw a flight path. Set common mission params, then tune points' altitude, heading, gimbal position and add some actions.\n - In-point actions: wait, take photo, start/stop video, rotate aircraft (yaw), set gimbal angle. Up to 15 in each waypoint)\n - Round-repeat waypoint actions up to 15 times\n - Custom actions timeout\n - Point-to-point or curved flight path with adjustable turn radius near each point\n - Ability to control drone's speed with RC joystick during automated flight\n - Set autospeed to 0 and move drone with RC joystick along its planned path - just like a cable camera\n - Auto-repeat mission up to 15 times\n - Go Home on connection loss or continue mission (Spark, Mini and Air 2 do not support this mode)\n\n* POI Mission *\n - Add point of interest (POI) to waypoint mission for auto heading\n\n* KML Import *\n - Create mapping or waypoint mission from KML polygon or line respectively\n - One file can contain multiple KML features, choose one on import\n\n* Drones and Batteries Management *\n - All system states and info, errors and warnings\n - Batteries health info. Checked and saved on each connection, available anytime\n - Multi-battery support\n - Save your drones and batteries to track state\n\n* Weather and Sun *\n - Hourly weather forecast with wind warnings\n - Sunrise and sunset time\n\n\nCheck Copterus app website for more info, discussions, support and tutorials: \n\n    www.copterus.app\n\nFeel free to send your questions or requests:\n\n    support@copterus.app"

      "label": "Bricolage is a powerful special-effects toolbox for tricking out your photos and movies like the Hollywood pros do. Pipe your video through a chain of basic effects, each processing the picture in a different way. With over 150 to choose from it is easy to create completely unique looks and effects.\n\nMix multiple images and animate special effects to give your videos the finishing touches they need, from subtle regional color correction or exposure adjustment, to wild cartoon colors or funhouse-mirror distortions.\nJust bring in a video (or photo!) and drop effects between the input and the output. Bricolage takes advantage of the powerful graphics hardware in your iPad or iPhone to deliver smooth playback and responsive controls. You can even zoom into your video while it's playing.\nAnd when you've built a great effect, you can save it for reuse with other projects. \n\nBricolage uses the industry-standard technique known as 'node-based compositing' to build complex effects from a chain of simple building blocks. You'll combine different layers using photoshop-style blending modes or black & white masks. Make different versions of an image and combine them back together to blur or darken the edges of an image, or selectively recolor the sky or ground. Use animated transitions to switch video streams or overlay text and graphics. Cut out shapes from pictures using Bezier curves. Apply image distortions and move them around the video, or use Apple's Face Recognition technology to mark or cover faces detected in your video. Place, scale and animate video overlays or shapes and gradients. Process your shots to look like a desert, or add film grain and a vintage photo process.  You can even add titles or overlay time code on your movies.\n\nBricolage uses custom Metal programs to process HD video in real time directly on the graphics processor. Node-based compositing used to require a powerful desktop computer, now Bricolage puts it in the palm of your hand.  If you have an older device, don't worry, Bricolage offers half- and quarter-resolution 'proxy' modes, so you can get a preview of most effects with responsive controls even at HD, while still producing a full-resolution movie. \n\nDespite its great power, Bricolage is quite simple to use. Just build a chain of effects for your images to flow through from the inputs to the output.  Drag effect nodes to 'kiss' the output of one to the input of another to form a connection. Or press and hold a link to insert a new node in the middle. With a zooming, scrolling canvas, you can organize your flows the way you like. Immediate feedback in the nodes makes it easy to experiment, while the full-screen node editor lets you perfect a single effect with enhanced tools.\n\nFeatures:\nProcess still images or videos\nCombined preview and node editing lets you create with live feedback\nPre-built templates to make advanced effects easy to give you a head start on your own awesome creations.\nSave your node flows as templates and import them into other projects\nBuilt-in help with inline descriptions of nodes and their parameters\nInfinite undos, and for the indecisive, re-dos.\nPlayback proxies at reduced resolution for more responsive editing on older devices\nZoom and pan photos and videos, even while playing\nMultiple output resolutions\nOver 127 standard Core Image Effects\nMany more custom effects including:\n Map Generator\n Path Move\n Recolor\n Tilt Shift\n Edge Outlines\n Lens Distortion\n 360° Spherical VR Unwrap\n Stipple\n Semantic Segmentation Node\n Saliency Detector\n Bricks pattern\n Map Generator Node\n Four-Up node\n ASCII Art\n Green Screen Remover*\n Fractal Noise*\n Film Grain*\n Text*\n Face Mask\n Relative Crop\n Fade Over\n Switcher\n Multi-mixer\n Color Bands\n Depth Key, Fog, Mix, Blur\n HSL/YUV/HWB Convert\n Time Code Overlay\n Red-Blue and Split-Screen Stereoscopic composite\n Primary, Secondary, 3D LUT Color Correction\n Flipbook/Sprite Atlas player\n\n*Fully functional effect, in-app purchase removes watermark"

      "label": "Photographer's Friend has three excellent photography calculators in one application, and now with two of them available for Apple Watch with almost full feature parity! We believe our Depth of Field Calculator with the Pixel Peeper mode turned on is the most accurate and detailed DOF Calculator available!\n\nDepth-of-Field Calculator\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCalculate the Depth of Field in your photographs based on your camera's sensor size, aperture, focal length, and focus distance, set with four dials along the base of the DoF Calc.\n\nThe display includes your Hyperfocal Distance, which can be temporarily transferred to the Focus Distance dial or locked for continuous updates. Display distances in metric units or feet and inches.\n\nBy default, we use traditional Depth of Field calculations, but Pixel Peeper mode calculates Depth of Field using your sensor size and megapixels for higher accuracy. You can also enter a custom Circle of Confusion size if you prefer. There's even a diffraction warning mode!\n\nDiffraction Limit guides adjust the color of the Aperture guide when there is a possibility of Diffraction. You can change the Diffraction Limit guide starting points as part of the Pro Add-on available as an In-App purchase.\n\nNeutral Density Filter Calculator\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEnter your base shutter speed into the Neutral Density Filter Calculator to calculate your new shutter speed after fitting ND filters to your lens. Filter labels include the multiplication factor (ND2, ND4, etc.) with f-stop and optical density values also displayed. You can hide filters that you don't use or bring them back again with slide gestures.\n\nA timer is available for shutter speeds of 3 seconds or longer, so if you don't have a timer switch or built-in timer in your camera, we'll time your exposure for you!\n\nExposure Shift Calculator\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhen changing your camera's exposure settings, it's not always obvious which settings to change to counter adjustments you make. When you adjust your aperture from f/5.6 to f/11, does your shutter speed need to go up or down? How does it affect your ISO? The Exposure Shift Calculator has the answers!\n\nEnter your current camera settings with the Aperture, Shutter Speed, and ISO dials, and watch Photographer's Friend calculate how changes to one dial affect the others. You can lock any of the three dials to calculate the other free dial automatically, or turn on Exposure Value Lock to have Photographer's Friend calculate all settings for you!\n\nAdditional Features as In-App Purchases\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPhotographer's Friend is fully functional at the marked price. However, several features such as Apple Watch Extensions and some Pro features available as In-App Purchase as they may not be of interest to everyone. There is also a bundle to save on the multiple individual Add-ons.\n\nLinks\n~~~~\nWe've included links to in-depth articles on Hyperfocal Distance, Understanding Neutral Density Filters and Circle of Confusion, the Airy Disk and Diffraction, and  Understanding Exposure Value, among other helpful content. We've also provided a link to online tutorial videos to walk you through each calculator and the optional Apple Watch Extensions.\n\nThere are links to email us directly or use our web contact form to ask general photography questions or send questions or suggestions for the app. We think we have all bases covered, but for example, if you own a Neutral Density filter that is not listed, let us know, and we'll add it in a future update.\n\nOnboarding Help\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDepth of Field, Neutral Density, Exposure Shift Calculators, and some settings screens have onboarding help with interface element highlighting to help you get to know your new Photographer's Friend.\n\nWhether you are just getting started or a seasoned professional photographer or educator, we think you'll find Photographer's Friend invaluable!"

The range of aperture and sensitivity (starting at 0.05 ASA ) allows for film, photo paper, wet-plate and as well as pinhole. \n\n* Built-in camera computes exposure; \n* alternatively enter EV reading for any lightmeter\n* or enter time metering to compute reciprocity effect.\n* Use built-in exposition timer and bubble level for optimal shot; \n* The light meter has a spot-meter feature and allows for incident metering;\n* Enter your camera aperture from the predefined list (170+ pinhole cameras) or compute it; \n* Let the assistant automatically compensate for reciprocity of film (correction for long exposures, 60+ different curves included), or use your own curves. \n* Save, restore and presets (combos) : aperture, predefined cameras, ASA and reciprocity settings \n• 30+ builtin filters (red, ND…), add your own, mafast acess  your favorites ,\n* Log shot information : preview, exposure, metering, location, interactive map , date and a shot. Export as picture, CSV or JSON file.\n\nYou can create film and set reciprocity curve from within Pinhole Assist. Crete new ones, or tweak existing ones. \n\nUse iTunes (on Mac/PC) to import/export access the films you created, or exchange them via email m curves (Go to the app Web Site for instructions)\n\n* timer usability : now tapping the chrono icon directly starts the timer starting the chronometer automatically create a log. \n*  Combos :  edit for your camera+ film combination (combo) the aperture or the predefined camera, as well as film speed and reciprocity.\n* Choosing a film reciprocity now sets the film speed. \n* 100+ different films, including Multigrade paper and Harman positive paper\n* 250+ different pinhole and zone plate cameras : Ondu, Diana, Holga, Sténoflex, Reality soSubtle, Lensless, Ilford, Stenopéika, Vermeer, 8banners, ZeroImage, Leonardo, Carlos, Nopo, Spiral, Sharan…\n\nAny other camera can be accommodated. \n\nGo to the Settings to :\n* adjust scales can be by ½ EV or ⅓ EV,\n* enable bellow correction: a button will appear on the main screen to allow bellow adjustment, allowing to use view cameras;\n* adjust the cell and incident metering constant;\n* start the timer automatically or not;\n* adjust log behavior.\n\n\nPlease note: this is not a camera app: it does not take picture.

      "label": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!"

See below for more info\n• Zoom Control on supported lenses\n• Trigger Stills capture\n• Record Start/Stop\n• White Balance + Tint, including 5 helpful presets and Auto White Balance\n• Audio Controls\n• Trigger Autofocus (for supported electronic lenses with autofocus enabled on lens)\n• Off-speed frame rates\n• Aperture (for supported electronic lenses)\n• Shutter Angle\n• ISO\n• Auto-Exposure Control\n• Active Card\n• Power On/Off\n• Monitor Overlays\n• Codec & Resolution\n• Enter metadata in the Digital Slate (including location data from your iPhone or iPad if you give permission)\n• Control Lock - locks critical controls while recording, preventing accidental settings changes during takes\n\n\n-- Follow Focus --\nYou can now pull focus wirelessly right from your iPhone or iPad. There are some limitations outlined below.\n• Currently only fully supports Pocket 4K, but as of v1.4 we now have limited support for EF mount cameras - Pocket 6K, Ursa Mini Pro G1 & G2\n• The camera does not supply the app with any information on the lenses current focus distance, so the app will not update in real time if you pull focus manually on the lens\n• Due to the nature of bluetooth, focus pulls may not be 100% smooth. It works well for nice slow pulls, but fast pulls my not feel entirely natural and organic. Unfortunately this is a limitation of the available technology.\n• On EF mount cameras, we can only offset focus from its current position, with no broader knowledge of where the lens is in its focus range. This means that focus marks are not possible. In addition, focus pulls on EF mount cameras can be quite jerky depending on the lens in use.\n\n\n-- Playback Control --\nWith Bluetooth+ you can control the playback of clips right from your iOS device. There are some notable limitations at this point. Currently you can:\n• Start playing a clip, either forwards or backwards\n• Navigate between clips, either forwards or backwards\n\nFor now, you will not be able to:\n• Pause a clip that is already playing\n• Change the speed of a clip that is already playing\n• Control clip looping\n\n\n-- Zoom Control --\nControl the zoom level on supported lenses. For the most part, this will only work on MFT lenses with electronic zoom. We are currently unaware of EF lenses that support this feature\n\n\n-- Slate-Only Mode --\nAs the name suggests, this feature locks the app into Slate-Only mode, without the ability to change critical camera settings or start/stop recording. This means you can let an assistant keep metadata up to date without the fear of interfering with important camera settings."

      "label": "Filmic Remote offers wireless control and monitoring of your Filmic Pro experience.  Filmic Remote puts your spare iOS devices into the production process.\n\nRemote v3 offers three modes of capability:  Control, Monitor and Director.\n\nControl mode provides the familiar Filmic Pro interface for complete remote camera control over hard to reach camera placements such as sliders, jib arms, car mounts, microphone stand or other compelling live event camera placements.  Set up your Filmic Pro device and then control all settings and recordings from the Remote:\n- Start/Stop record functions.\n- Focus/exposure reticle placement and locking.\n- Dual arc slider manual controls for focus and exposure.\n- Pull-to-point focus and exposure pulls.\n- Create and load Filmic Pro presets from Filmic Remote.\n\nMonitor mode gives you cinema production capability for a fraction of the cost, offering a four-up display with the following powerful analytics:\n- Video preview:  Reference video for use with analytics screens.\n- Waveform monitor:  Visually identifies signal brightness segmented from left to right across a video feed.  Used in conjunction with the video preview it can provide a quick snapshot of brightness in your video.\n- Vectorscope:  Displays color saturation, by channel, across the entire image.\n- Histograms:  RGB composite, Luminance,  Zone and RGB channel. \n\nDirector mode provides a clean video preview.  This is perfect for providing a director, producer or crew with a device to monitor the production remotely. \n\nYou can switch between modes on the fly to check analytics and composition.  Remote can also be set up in ‘preview-only’ mode allowing a camera operator to perform all controls from the device running Filmic Pro and allowing the Remote to be used solely for monitoring.\n\nCreate your mobile studio today with Filmic Remote!\n\nNotes: \n- The use of Filmic Remote on one iOS device requires the simultaneous use of Filmic Pro on an additional device.  Both devices must be running iOS 13 or later.\n- Filmic Remote connects to Filmic Pro using Wi-Fi either on an established network or using a peer-to-peer network (for using in areas where a Wi-Fi network is not present).\n- Filmic Remote can connect to any iPhone or iPad running Filmic Pro and is not cross platform."

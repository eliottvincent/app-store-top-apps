Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop.

      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

      "label": "Intuitive yet powerful, Lumos accurately predicts the position of the sun and moon at any time, on any day, in any place. Whether you’re planning a photo shoot, a wedding, or a solar panel installation, tracking the sun and moon has never been easier!\n\nLumos is divided into six main modules:\n\n• The augmented reality view harnesses the power of AR to visually project past, present, or future sun and moon positions (and moon phases!) onto your surroundings, letting you perfectly visualize your plans.\n\n• The map view overlays the sun and moon positions for a given time and location onto a map of that location, letting you make plans from afar.\n\n• The Street View mode works like the AR view, but it takes advantage of Google Street View to allow you to envision sun and moon positions for remote locations (requires Lumos Pro).\n\n• The calendar view displays a simple list of rise/set times and moon phases throughout the year, letting you see the big picture at a glance. Tap a row to see the detailed ephemeris for that day.\n\n• The notifications module lets you sign up to receive notifications for significant solar and lunar events, including: astronomical, nautical, and civil dawn/dusk, blue hour, golden hour, sunrise/set, solar noon, moon rise/set, lunar transit, and lunar perigee/apogee (requires Lumos Pro).\n\n• The shadow length view calculates the exact length of the shadow an object will cast on a given time and day, letting you see the result both visually and numerically. You can also calculate the height of an object if you know the length of its shadow.\n\n\nWith an affordable one-time purchase of Lumos Pro, you can also:\n\n• Search for a location by name or manually enter coordinates\n\n• Save locations for later reference or offline use*\n\n• Take notes on a saved location and have them readily available the next time you view it\n\n\n*The map view and Street View do not currently support offline use\n\nNOTE: The sun and moon positions calculated by Lumos are accurate to within a small fraction of a degree. However, as with any augmented-reality app, the accuracy of the projection is dependent on the underlying hardware. If you are seeing inaccurate positions, please calibrate your device's compass and ensure that you are not near any sources of electromagnetic interference (e.g. microwaves, computers, car engines, high voltage lines). Phone cases containing batteries are known to cause compass interference. You can also use the visual calibration tool to align the projection with sun’s current position. Please feel free to contact us if you continue to have issues.\n\n_____________\n\nTerms of Use: https://termsfeed.com/terms-use/c5bcd4de47ffe3020e8aebd04a91af68\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/8042948/full-legal"

      "label": "Watch any web-video, online movie, livestream or live tv show on your Samsung Smart TV or Blu-ray Player. Enjoy the show on your big screen with the no#1 web video streamer.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast for Samsung Smart TV you can browse the web and stream any web video, online movie, livestream or live tv show you want on your Samsung Smart TV. Mp4, m3u8, hls livestreams and also video-over-https are supported.\n \nThere is no time limit at all! You can watch videos of 2 minutes or 2 hours or even more. Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for link detection and send the video with a single tap to your Samsung Smart TV. The discovered link will be shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the Samsung App Store (Smart Hub) on your TV or Blu-ray Player, search for 'TV Cast' and install the receiver app.\n\n* Please enter the ip-adress of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your Samsung TV Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and other DRM protected videos like HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please use the Remote Playbar for video control while browsing (see more info below)\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all Samsung Smart TVs and Blu-ray Players. You can also use the included TV Remote for basic video control (play, pause, stop, forward and rewind videos) and navigating in Samsung Smart Hub. The TV Remote currently works on 2010 - 2013 TVs.\n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Samsung or any other trademark mentioned here."

Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your TV or gaming console. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Google Cast enabled device immediately.

If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast.

Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google, Sony, Philips, Vizio, Sharp, Asus, Nvidia or one of their products and trademarks."

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Fire TV.\n\n* Supported Fire TVs: Fire TV Box+Stick, Fire TV Cube and all other devices of the Fire TV Family.\n\n* Supported TVs: Insignia TV and Toshiba TV with Fire TV Edition\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Fire TV must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nBrowse the web and stream your favorite webvideo or online TV show on a DLNA player like Samsung TV, LG TV, Sony TV, Philips TV, Toshiba TV, Panasonic TV, Xbox 360, Xbox One, EZCast, WD TV, Kodi (XBMC), SONOS and many other devices that use DLNA / UPnP / AllShare. Please try the free app version to check if your specific DLNA player is supported.\n\nMp4, m3u8, hls live streaming, video over https and of course Full HD are supported. And there is no time limit at all! Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for video link detection and send the video with a single tap to your DLNA player. The discovered link is shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. \n\n* The app only works with a DLNA player that is capable of \"media rendering\". \n\n* Sony Bravia TVs: Please enable the renderer function of your TV to enable casting. See http://bit.ly/1VKM60A\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please use the hardware remote of your DLNA player to forward, rewind and pause a running video.\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to try it multiple times until it works on your specific DLNA player.\n\n* If a video does not cast, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. FAQ did not help? Please drop us a mail and give us the chance to help you before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can enable/disable it at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Add and manage as many bookmarks as you want, either in the bookmarks menu or directly in the browser.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: After purchasing this you can set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nPlease note that this app may not work with all DLNA devices out there. But we are working hard to improve this app with every update. Your feedback will drive our work ahead and you'll see improvements and new features in the next update. Please send your feedback to info@video-tv-cast.com\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with the Digital Living Network Alliance or any other trademark mentioned here."

      "label": "Watch webvideos, online movies, live tv streams and your personal photos, videos & music on your Amazon Fire TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any video you want on your Amazon Fire TV (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "Reeflex is the best photography app on the App Store designed for enthusiasts, creatives, and professional photographers! The app provides pro-level DSLR features directly on your iPhone while being extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\n— Professional Tools for Everyone —\n\nReeflex offers two main capture modes - the main one for classic still photography and the IAP long exposure photography mode - providing a rich set of professional tools for full manual control over focus, exposure, and white balance. The live histograms combined with the zebra stripes allow you to precisely monitor your exposure. The focus peaking is a powerful guide for adjusting the focus on your subject. By a simple two-finger tap on the viewfinder, Reeflex also allows you to independently adjust focus and exposure, moving two reticles across the scene.  \n\nReeflex allows shooting in HEIF, JPG, TIFF, or RAW on all iPhone models. You can also shoot in the Apple ProRAW* format and 48MP*** on compatible devices.\n\n— Slow Shutter Mode (IAP) —\n\nReeflex offers the best long-exposure tools on the App Store. Enjoy the flexibility of manual controls and watch the picture forming on the screen. Select either Motion Blur or Light Trails modes to make people disappear, give moving water & cloudy skies a smooth silky appearance, or transform busy roads and starry skies into stunning rivers of light. Long Exposure on iPhone has never been easier than now!\n\n— Honorable Mentions —\n\nOnly a few days after its launch Reeflex was listed as “Must Have APPS - You Never Heard About” by the highly popular iReviews YouTube channel. Reeflex Pro Camera is now a top-tier camera app vastly acclaimed among the iPhone photography community worldwide, being featured by some as the \"best camera app\" for 2022 across several youtube channels and mobile photography magazines (Mobiography.net, PhotoFocus.com, iPhonephototeam.com)\n\n— MAIN FEATURES —\n\n• Still photography mode with full manual controls\n(ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance)\n• Automated Focus and Exposure reticles (AF/AE)\n• Luma and RGB zebra stripes\n• Live luma and RGB histograms \n• Advanced focus peaking\n• Support for multiple cameras\n• JPEG, HEIF, or TIFF as processed formats\n• Apple’s ProRAW* and RAW** support\n• Wide Angle camera 48MP support***\n• GPS location in photos’ metadata\n• Gyroscopic tiltmeter\n• Extended digital zoom up to 10x\n• Integrated camera roll\n• Color-blind users' support: customization of focus peaking colors\n• Tutorials, tips, and detailed explanations are available in the settings section\n\n— SLOW SHUTTER MODES (in-app purchase) —\n\n• Motion blur mode: blur movement, from silky waterfalls to dreamy cloudy skies\n• Light trails mode: transform busy roads and starry skies into stunning rivers of light\n• Wide range of long-exposure capture durations, from 0.5 seconds up to 2 hours\n• Bulb mode - select a custom long-exposure capture duration\n• Live Preview - allows you to monitor the long-exposure capture\n\n— REMARKS —\n\n*ProRAW is only supported on iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.\nOn other iPhone devices, when the RAW format is selected, photos will be saved in the standard Bayer RAW format.\nNote: RAW format requires an iPhone 6s or later.\n\n**On devices older than iPhone 12, hence from iPhone 11 and prior, the RAW format is not supported on the Ultrawide camera\n\n***48MP is only supported on the main Wide Angle camera on the latest iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.\nNote: RAW format does only support 12MP.\n\n— GET IN TOUCH —\n\nWe'd love to hear from you!

The range of aperture and sensitivity (starting at 0.05 ASA ) allows for film, photo paper, wet-plate and as well as pinhole. \n\n* Built-in camera computes exposure; \n* alternatively enter EV reading for any lightmeter\n* or enter time metering to compute reciprocity effect.\n* Use built-in exposition timer and bubble level for optimal shot; \n* The light meter has a spot-meter feature and allows for incident metering;\n* Enter your camera aperture from the predefined list (170+ pinhole cameras) or compute it; \n* Let the assistant automatically compensate for reciprocity of film (correction for long exposures, 60+ different curves included), or use your own curves. \n* Save, restore and presets (combos) : aperture, predefined cameras, ASA and reciprocity settings \n• 30+ builtin filters (red, ND…), add your own, mafast acess  your favorites ,\n* Log shot information : preview, exposure, metering, location, interactive map , date and a shot. Export as picture, CSV or JSON file.\n\nYou can create film and set reciprocity curve from within Pinhole Assist. Crete new ones, or tweak existing ones. \n\nUse iTunes (on Mac/PC) to import/export access the films you created, or exchange them via email m curves (Go to the app Web Site for instructions)\n\n* timer usability : now tapping the chrono icon directly starts the timer starting the chronometer automatically create a log. \n*  Combos :  edit for your camera+ film combination (combo) the aperture or the predefined camera, as well as film speed and reciprocity.\n* Choosing a film reciprocity now sets the film speed. \n* 100+ different films, including Multigrade paper and Harman positive paper\n* 250+ different pinhole and zone plate cameras : Ondu, Diana, Holga, Sténoflex, Reality soSubtle, Lensless, Ilford, Stenopéika, Vermeer, 8banners, ZeroImage, Leonardo, Carlos, Nopo, Spiral, Sharan…\n\nAny other camera can be accommodated. \n\nGo to the Settings to :\n* adjust scales can be by ½ EV or ⅓ EV,\n* enable bellow correction: a button will appear on the main screen to allow bellow adjustment, allowing to use view cameras;\n* adjust the cell and incident metering constant;\n* start the timer automatically or not;\n* adjust log behavior.\n\n\nPlease note: this is not a camera app: it does not take picture.

      "label": "Designed by a photographer for photographers, focused on RELIABILITY and PRECISION for digital and analog photography.\n\n• Extended sensitivity as low as -2/-4EV (dark scenes)\n\n• Two different convenient interface designs.\n\n• Incident and reflected light metering modes.\n\n• Save exposure data.\n\n• f/Tools connection.\n\n• Independent calibration for the two metering modes.\n\n• Independent selection of aperture, speed, ISO and exposure compensation with 1/3 resolution. From 4 minutes to 1/8000 sec., aperture from 1.0 to 512 and iso from 3 to 6400.\n\n• Automatic priority for aperture or speed. (Automatic Av and Tv modes).\n\n• Automatic ISO or locked ISO options.\n\n• Point metering in camera view.\n\n• Maximum aperture limited by the selected lens.\n\n• Calculate the average of any number of measurements you want.\n\n• Read the exposure data of any photo from the gallery.\n\n• Calculate hyperfocal distance for 5 memorized lenses. Which also blocks maximum aperture.\n\n• Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.\n\n• Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light. (IR button)\n\n• Exposure value EV on an analog scale or right up front.\n\n• Two LED indicators show whether the measurement is unreliable due to lack of light in the scene, or if we have under 30% battery left.\n\n• On 3.5 \" displays preset lens buttons tilting the device or tapping at the bottom.\n\n• Be advised that accurate incident light reading needs a diffuser attached to the front camera. Without the diffuser still can be used but think about it, it will be a reflected reading taken with the front camera.\n\nI'm an independent photographer/designer/developer and am very grateful for your support. Trying to do the best lightmeter app ever, a lot more to come. You can ask for any improvement and I'll be happy to help. This app is constantly reviewed and improved because it is my tool, if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me by email at davidquiles@me.com\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid Quiles"

I easily transferred 15,000 files from my Mac to camera roll.\n\n\n\ngreat app ever.... ⁕⁕⁕⁕⁕\nby Dinh2013 – Jun 8, 2019\n\nYour app is the best on the market today since from day one...I am so glad you have updated the app. Bravo you are the best !\n\n\n\nWorks like a charm ⁕⁕⁕⁕⁕\nby Roobns – Jun 2, 2019\n\nWorks like a charm after the last update.

This is an amazing tool and very well worth the download! If I could put 10 stars I would! Seriously, download this!\n\n\n\nSaved me ⁕⁕⁕⁕⁕\nby Solidsnake4444 – Sep 26, 2015\n\nI don't normally write reviews but this app saved me. My iPhone got a corrupted hard drive and I was not able to do an iTunes backup. I manually copied over my pictures but I had no way to put them back into the camera roll on my new phone. This app did it perfectly and easily. Just dragged and dropped all pictures in and it did it. Over 12,000 pictures and video. I did order by date for the transfer and everything is in order. \n\n\n\nAmazing and exactly what I needed! ⁕⁕⁕⁕⁕\nby cassiecsws – Sep 16, 2015\n\nOkay so I never write reviews. Ever. Unless it's going to give me extra points/coins on a game. However, this app is everything I wanted. I just upgraded my phone and when I tried to move photos from iPhoto on my Mac, it went into a separate folder. Not in the camera roll. That may seem like not a big deal, but it was to me. This app moved ALL of my photos back to the camera roll. Thank you so much! I highly recommend it!"

Instead of spending all that time setting up your big camera, just choose your desired film/sensor size and focal length in the app and point the iPhone camera at what you want to photo to verify framing. If you are happy with the framing then you can get the big camera out. The app has a large database of camera sensors details and film formats but if the format you desire isn’t there you can add your own custom format. The app is targeted at stills photographers or film makers working in either film or digital. If you don’t have your big camera with you, Viewfinder Preview is still great for photo sketching, location scouting or story boarding.\n\nThe app includes\n\n- Customisable menus so you can include the film/sensor formats and focal lengths you care about.\n- A fully configurable light meter.\n- You can take photos with it, so you have a record of shots you were framing.\n- Photos taken with the app include additional data that describe the film format, focal length and lighting meter settings at the time the shot was taken\n- Add notes to your photos\n- A photo gallery for viewing photos taken with the app which also displays the additional data\n- Share images in emails, messages\n- Create albums of photos from the same project, trip etc\n- Create PDF documents of albums\n- Film stock emulation\n- Wide angle lens adapter support"

      "label": "LED aquarium lights are brilliant, but blue (actinic) light interferes with your camera sensor, changing the beautiful colors of your fish and corals into a scene from a black light filled roller rink from the 1980's.\n\nEnter our hopeful hero, Aquarium Camera. It dreams of ridding the internet of bad aquarium photography. It's designed to color correct the actinic light from LEDs in real-time on our mobile devices, the thing we use to take photos of everything else in our lives, except our tanks... until now. \n\n\"The Aquarium Camera app is an essential tool for reef tank photography.\" – ReefBuilders.com\n\nYou can now stop buying pro camera rigs, shooting in raw, buying gels, and turning off your blue lights to get great and accurate shots of your tank. You don't need to spend hours in post-production or photo editing apps, tweaking the hue and lighting of each of your photos. Simply put, all you need is the Aquarium Camera and an iPad or iPhone to get GREAT photos and videos of your aquarium. \n\n“So easy to use…  Love it!!!  And the color changing is realtime so you can see the screen and the real thing side by side to ensure you get the right balance.” \n– Carlos Chacon, IT Manager at CoralVue\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Real-time white balance color\n• Real-time RGB adjustment\n• *NEW* Real-time Gel mode - orange gels are typically used by professional photographers to compensate for blue light. The new gel mode works like magic by simulating what a gel over your lens will do to your shots. It goes a step further by dynamically changing it's color based on what it sees in your shot (it's like buying millions of gels and picking just the right one for each shot)\n• Take Photos or Video\n• Portrait and Landscape photos (obviously)\n• Digital pinch to zoom\n• Touch to focus\n• Manually control brightness\n• Toggle the flash on/off (works great if your corals are really close to the glass in your aquarium)\n• Download it one time and use on your iPad and iPhone\n• Quickly access your camera roll to review shots\n• Share photos or videos right from the library\n\nSpecial thanks to the members of Reef2Reef.com for testing version 3.0 of the app! Over 250 aquarists tested version 3.0 prior to pushing to the app store. Check out the Reef2Reef, ReefCentral, Nano-Reef and ChicagoReefs forums to see some of their awesome aquarium photos! Super big thanks to Reef2Reef members Jason Mack, Scott Nelson, Scurvy, NorthFLreefer, ReeferMadness80G, Budau18 and Stratru362 for giving me permission to use their photos in the preview!\n\nI created the Aquarium Camera app because I was tired of seeing posts of brilliant aquariums on forums like Reef2Reef, Nano-Reef, ReefCentral that don't truly represent the health and beauty of the fish, plants, and corals inside. It wasn't as big of a problem in the days of VHO, Power Compacts and Metal Halide lighting, but with LEDs now taking over the aquarium lighting space, we needed another solution. \n\nLet's commit ourselves to spending less time trying to correct the lighting on our aquarium photos and videos and more time enjoying our fish, shrimp, snails, plants, and corals... oh, and doing water changes.\n\nThe before and after shots in the preview were taken at the 2017 Aquatic Experience Kessil booth, A80 Tuna Blues. The video was taken under an AquaIllumination Nano LED fixture."

If you enter additional 'NDI Access' IP Addresses from other subnets into the system prefs panel for NDI Monitor, those NDI sources may also be accessed.  Includes support for NDI Discovery server (see app settings), resolution control, video flip for autocue and control of NDI network Protocol for reliability.\n\nNotes: A very stable WIFI connection, or a wired ethernet connection are required for smooth playback of NDI Streams. Using a directional WIFI antenna and using the sweet spot of your wifi can help. If you experience glitching of audio or dropped video frames, the problem is very likely a wifi connection which is insufficiently stable to support smooth NDI video to iOS - in this case please try a wired ethernet to lightning adaptor.\n\nYou should not expect perfect performance when selecting Hi Resolution NDI - which is offered as an experimental mode for users with very fast devices, on very fast, clean network connections.  In some cases you may see great results in hi res.\n\nThere are preferences in the System Settings app for NDI Monitor to setup application options. You can also use the app NDI Scanner as a stream selector -  it will open NDI Monitor when you click on a selected stream.\n \nNB. This app does not support NDI | HX1 format streams - only full NDI format and NDI HX2"

      "label": "Obscura 3 is a camera app packed full of features to help you take incredible photos. Obscura pairs a stunning design with intuitive controls that make taking photos a delight.\n—\n\nObscura 2 has been featured numerous times by Apple around the world, including as Editor’s Choice and App of the Day. And Obscura 3 is even better.\n—\n\nDesign\n\nObscura squeezes a bunch of powerful features into simple controls anyone can master. The interface balances aesthetics, ergonomics, and intuitiveness.

All gorgeous. \n—\n\n\nCamera Features\n—\n\nModes\nObscura 3 has been designed around 5 distinct camera modes: \nPhoto - simple, fast performance\nPro Photo - maximum control \nDepth - portraits & depth data\nLive Photo - for.. Live Photos\nVideo - video capture with pro controls\n\nExposure\nTo adjust exposure, just touch your thumb to the Exposure Button and move it in a circle, like turning a dial. Couldn’t be simpler and it feels great. And you can just tap the button to instantly reset the exposure bias.\n\nFocus\nJust like exposure, drag your thumb around the Focus Button to focus manually. And you’ll get both a focus loupe and focus peaking to help you get your subject perfectly crisp. ^1\n\nISO & Shutter Speed\nTK\n\nWhite Balance\nAWB, White Point, Scene Presets, and manual Temp + Tint.\n\nPhoto Formats\nProRAW ^2, RAW, HEIC, and JPEG photos, Live Photos and Depth Data ^3. \n\nVideo Formats\n1080p or 4K at 24,30 or 60fps ^4\n\nFilters\nLots of new filters, some old favorites. You can now disable filters and set favorites for quick access. All included.\n\nAspect Ratio\nCapture photos in 4:3, 1:1, 16:9, and 2:1 aspect ratios.\n\nHistogram\nSmall or large, luminance or color.\n\nGrid\nLines, crosshairs, or none.\n\nSpirit Level\nFor perfectly level horizons that would make Wes Anderson proud.\n\nFlash\nYep.\n\nTimer\nI hear tick tock is really popular with the youths.\n\nPresets\nCustomise Obscura to your heart’s content, and save those customisations into presets to quickly access at any time.\n—\n \nLibrary\n\nNot only has the camera interface been redesigned, but the library has been reconsidered from the ground up to give you quick access to your most important photos, without sacrificing performance.\n—\n\nView Options\nObscura lets you configure exactly what’s displayed in the library views, so you can hide screenshots and memes to help you focus on your photos.\n\nYou can also adjust the size of thumbnails to suit your preference. And keep hidden photos hidden. Naturally.\n—\n\nImage View & Editing\nBrowse, share, fav, rate, edit. Whether you want to dig into metadata, triage through your vacation photos, or apply some cool filters, you’ll find it here.\n—\n\n\nSettings & More\nObscura’s Settings has a bunch of options, allowing you to manage filters, tweak camera behaviours, change the theme, read the walkthrough and more.\n—\n\nApple Watch Support\nUse your Apple Watch as a camera remote. You can change capture mode, set exposure and more!\n—\n\nGame Controller Support (Beta)\nIt’s a little rough, but yes, you can use a game controller to control your camera.\n———\n\n\n1. Manual Focus only available in single camera modes, not while using a Virtual Dual or Triple camera. Yes, this sucks but the virtual cameras are weird and full of quirks\n2. ProRAW only available on iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro\n3. Depth Data only available on Dual, Triple, or TrueDepth Camera systems\n4. Video formats vary by device\n\nThanks for checking out Obscura. If you decide to buy, we hope you’ll consider rating it, or sharing with someone you think might like it. \n\nAll the best,\nBen & Adam"

Combine multiple photos to create artistic double exposure, surreal or just fun juxtaposed photo. \n\nSuperimpose provides a very simple workflow, which almost anyone can follow. Yet, it provides a wide range of tools suitable even for advanced users, to create complex compositions.\n\nBlend/mix/combine/cut/copy and paste one photo on another. Creating double exposure photo is as easy as loading two photos and then choosing opacity and blending modes.\n\nWith advanced masking tools, you can manually or semi-automatically erase portions from one image and then blend that with another photo. From magic lasso, that cuts out an image from a roughly painted boundary to a simple brush masking tool, you can use wide range of masking tools to create all sorts of masking, using this app.\n\nThe app has tons of masking tools like brush, smart brush, magic wand, magic lasso, lasso, polygon, rectangle, ellipse, linear and radial gradient and color range. Text masking tool and you can even create a mask from an image.\n\nAnd how do you cut out hair or fur of your pet? You can create fine mask of hair, using hair masking tool even to cut out hair!\n\nTo keep the flow simple, Superimpose works with two photos at a time. But you can keep merging and keep adding more and more layers of photos to create complex compositions.\n\nTo blend two photos even better, the app supports a set of adjustment tools like exposure, saturation, hue, color balance, curve etc.\n\nApart from blending, advanced masking and filters, Superimpose comes equipped with assorted set of editing tools like perspective correction, adding text with extensive text settings and tools like motion blur, zoom blur etc.\n\nCreating a natural shadow of objects that you blend with a photo is easier than ever. A dedicated tool just to create a shadow.\n\nStore all your cut outs, stickers or masks in a built-in mask library. For example, you can take photo of your products, mask them and then save them in the mask library. You can later add those cut outs on a background you want to add it to.\n\nCreate a fun photo by adding one part of the photo as a foreground and another photo as a background.\n\nSave images in high resolution either in JPEG, PNG or HEIC format."

      "label": "DoubleTake by Filmic transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll."

Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  \n\nOK!  Now what??\n\nDo you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do! Enable manual mode; set the focus to infinity; change the temperature to a certain number; change the ISO between certain values; change the shutter speed to something else....wait what...?\n\nDon't worry, this app does all of that for you so all you have to do is find those lights.  ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!\n\nWorth a shot !

Then process them with your favorite photogrammetry software (Metashape Pro, WebODM, Pix4D, Drone Deploy, MapsMadeEasy, SimActive etc) to get orthomosaic maps, digital terrain and elevation models (DTM, DEM).\n - Automatic flight planning based on camera parameters, overlaps and altitude\n - Estimates for GSD, flight time, number of photos and batteries\n - Multiple flights for massive areas\n - Custom start/finish positions\n - Pause mission and move backwards to retake some photos\n - Automatic takeoff or start mission after manual takeoff \n - Plan beforehand and try any DJI drone and camera to fit your mission\n - Land, hover or return after flight\n - Go Home on connection loss or continue mission (Spark, Mini and Air 2 do not support connectionless mode)\n\n* Waypoints Mission *\nFor smooth and repeatable time-lapse videos and photos (even seasonal time-lapse), photo reports from the same exact positions, search and rescue operations, aerial monitoring and video surveillance.\nTap desired locations to draw a flight path. Set common mission params, then tune points' altitude, heading, gimbal position and add some actions.\n - In-point actions: wait, take photo, start/stop video, rotate aircraft (yaw), set gimbal angle. Up to 15 in each waypoint)\n - Round-repeat waypoint actions up to 15 times\n - Custom actions timeout\n - Point-to-point or curved flight path with adjustable turn radius near each point\n - Ability to control drone's speed with RC joystick during automated flight\n - Set autospeed to 0 and move drone with RC joystick along its planned path - just like a cable camera\n - Auto-repeat mission up to 15 times\n - Go Home on connection loss or continue mission (Spark, Mini and Air 2 do not support this mode)\n\n* POI Mission *\n - Add point of interest (POI) to waypoint mission for auto heading\n\n* KML Import *\n - Create mapping or waypoint mission from KML polygon or line respectively\n - One file can contain multiple KML features, choose one on import\n\n* Drones and Batteries Management *\n - All system states and info, errors and warnings\n - Batteries health info.

Filmic Remote puts your spare iOS devices into the production process.\n\nRemote v3 offers three modes of capability:  Control, Monitor and Director.\n\nControl mode provides the familiar Filmic Pro interface for complete remote camera control over hard to reach camera placements such as sliders, jib arms, car mounts, microphone stand or other compelling live event camera placements.  Set up your Filmic Pro device and then control all settings and recordings from the Remote:\n- Start/Stop record functions.\n- Focus/exposure reticle placement and locking.\n- Dual arc slider manual controls for focus and exposure.\n- Pull-to-point focus and exposure pulls.\n- Create and load Filmic Pro presets from Filmic Remote.\n\nMonitor mode gives you cinema production capability for a fraction of the cost, offering a four-up display with the following powerful analytics:\n- Video preview:  Reference video for use with analytics screens.\n- Waveform monitor:  Visually identifies signal brightness segmented from left to right across a video feed.  Used in conjunction with the video preview it can provide a quick snapshot of brightness in your video.\n- Vectorscope:  Displays color saturation, by channel, across the entire image.\n- Histograms:  RGB composite, Luminance,  Zone and RGB channel. \n\nDirector mode provides a clean video preview.  This is perfect for providing a director, producer or crew with a device to monitor the production remotely. \n\nYou can switch between modes on the fly to check analytics and composition.  Remote can also be set up in ‘preview-only’ mode allowing a camera operator to perform all controls from the device running Filmic Pro and allowing the Remote to be used solely for monitoring.\n\nCreate your mobile studio today with Filmic Remote!\n\nNotes: \n- The use of Filmic Remote on one iOS device requires the simultaneous use of Filmic Pro on an additional device.  Both devices must be running iOS 13 or later.\n- Filmic Remote connects to Filmic Pro using Wi-Fi either on an established network or using a peer-to-peer network (for using in areas where a Wi-Fi network is not present).\n- Filmic Remote can connect to any iPhone or iPad running Filmic Pro and is not cross platform."

Albers, 1966)\nGeometriCam uses the iPhone camera as a live video source to generate stylish geometric compositions in real-time.\nExplore your surroundings through the eyes of geometry and be amazed by shapes and colors that change as you move around: creating abstract masterpieces has never been so fun and easy!\n\n«The fizzing real-time patterns on GeometriCam are reminiscent of those closed-eye hallucinations you get with eyes shut in a darkened room or staring with lids closed at bright lights.» (Kevin Holmes - The Creators Project/VICE)\n\n«Whether you use it for an eye-catching selfie or something more unusual, do it soon because GeometriCam offers a look that could well catch on quickly.» (Martin Bryant - The Next Web)\n\nWith GeometriCam you can:\n- capture beautifully crisp images and video clips while controlling a powerful GPU-accelerated filtering engine;\n- import and process images and video clips straight from your photo albums and export professional-quality content;\n- take total control of different stages of non-linear, non-destructive granular editing through innovative and intuitive tools.\n\nLAYOUT\nBehind the scenes your composition is a grid: use your fingers to change the size and aspect ratio of the cells or benefit from smart tools specifically created to help you adjust, refine and frame the layout. See complex patterns come true in seconds thanks to a special UI designed to offer a streamlined, one-handed experience.\n\nSHAPES\nEnjoy a large variety of shapes to choose from (triangles, squares, diamonds, circles and lines) and see your design moving in a few taps from swiss concrete art to tetris-like scenes, from classic polka dots to pop illustrations. Specify the properties of the pattern units underlying the composition by means of innovative custom controls and experiment with shapes like never before!\n\nCOLORS\nDefine the color palette of your artwork and lose yourself in the interplay of shapes and colors. Generate standard or monochromatic color filters with a single tap or precisely adjust Red, Green and Blue channels. Modulate the intensity of the filter in order to find the dress that perfectly suits the character of your composition.\n\nTUNING\nFine-tune the appearance or simply add a finishing touch to your masterpiece. Reduce the color depth to redefine the style of your design (ideal for retro-game or glitchy looks) or apply standard adjustments such as exposure, brightness, contrast, saturation, vibrance and fade.\n\nPRESETS\nUse carefully crafted presets, shipping with the app to get you started, or create your own so you can save and recall your best achievements. Remix and merge existing presets by simply choosing one of the countless combinations of their elemental properties (shapes, colors and tuning): more presets is more fun - just roll the dice and enjoy the surprise!\n\nVORTEX\nHave fun transforming your creations into sparkling circular compositions with this mesmerizing effect. Easily zoom in/out or adjust direction, rotation, swirl and joint angle, all in real-time, all using just your fingers.\n\nPOLYGON (new in v1.2)\nGive your creations a dose of magic and get even more kaleidoscopic results with this powerful new effect. Use your fingers to adjust rotation, sampling (the repeating section), slicing (the number of sides) or just zoom in/out. Jump into a world of ever-changing dreamscapes and you’ll never want to go back!\n\n—\n\nHighlights:\n\n- For images and video clips\n- Real-time preview and processing\n- High quality output (for printing and further video editing)\n- Large variety of scalable, stretchable shapes\n- Wide range of styles, from subtle graphics to abstract scenes\n- Lots of presets to get started\n- Fun and easy, encourages experimentation\n- Designed to offer a smooth, one-handed experience\n\n—\n\nQuestions?

Because the binoculars try to make the image a little more accurate and lower the blur a bit when the digital zoom approaches 60X zoom than if you zoom in to the 60x with normal zoom. This is particularly noticeable when it's a clear day.\nThe magnification quality will depend entirely on your camera.\nBinoculars can come in handy when you are in a hopeless situation when traveling, for example, and you simply don’t have a real device to take a closer look and capture an image of something. Although this will not replace the real thing, binoculars are convenient to have as a last resort. Then of course, you can save photos of things that you find around the world.\n\n- Up to 60X Digital Zoom\n- Manual focus\n- Manual exposure\n- Auto focus\n- Auto exposure\n- Photos is saving in your iPhone gallery"

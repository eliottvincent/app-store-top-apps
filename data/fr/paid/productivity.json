For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Within the hour, you’ll have everything off your mind and neatly organized—from routine tasks to your biggest life goals—and you can start focusing on what matters today.\n\n“Things offers the best combination of design and functionality of any app we tested, with nearly all the features of other power user applications and a delightful interface that never gets in the way of your work.”\n—Wirecutter, The New York Times\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• Your To-Dos\nYour basic building block is the almighty To-Do—each a small step toward a great accomplishment. You can add notes, tag it, schedule it, and break it down into smaller steps.\n\n• Your Projects\nCreate a Project for any big goal, then add the to-dos to reach it. Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)\n\n\nMORE THINGS TO LOVE\n\nAs you dive deeper, you’ll find Things packed with helpful features.

Just raise your wrist to glance at your Today list, mark to-dos complete as you go, and dictate new ones on the fly—all synced instantly with your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\n\nAWARD-WINNING DESIGN\n\nMade in Stuttgart, with two Apple Design Awards to its name, Things is a fine example of German engineering: designed not only to look fantastic, but to be perfectly functional as well. Every detail is thoughtfully considered, then polished to perfection.\n\n“It’s like the unicorn of productivity tools: deep enough for serious work, surprisingly easy to use, and gorgeous enough to enjoy staring at.”\n—Apple\n\n\nGET THINGS TODAY\n\nWhatever it is you want to accomplish in life, Things can help you get there.

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "iMobileSitter protects passwords, PINs and TAN lists using an innovative technique that offers higher security than conventional password managers. At the same time, iMobileSitter is as easy to use as conventional products. Hackers get nuts due to iMobileSitter's resistance against typical attacks (e.g., dictionary and brute-force attacks). Such attacks use trial and error to find the correct master password. Technologies like cloud computing allow to tremendously speed-up these attacks. Hackers do not even have expert knowledge to run the attacks. Many of these supposed secure password managers are actually easy prey for hackers, even if they use strong encryption algorithms such as AES, since important security assumptions for using these algorithms have been neglected by conventional products. iMobileSitter is different. Here, strong cryptographic algorithms are applied in such way that hackers do not get any usable feedback. Thus, when using iMobileSitter the stored passwords are secure. \n\nBesides a higher security level, iMobileSitter provides additional features such as secure random password generation and a backup and restore function to provide additional reliability of the stored secrets in case of defect, loss, or theft. iMobileSitter combines higher security with convenience functions and easy to use interface.\n\niMobileSitter was developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT in Germany. \n\n\nSECURITY\n\niMobileSitter provides resistance against dictionary and brute force attacks. Nowadays, hackers usually test huge amounts of possible master passwords in order to get to the stored secrets. When using conventional password managers to encrypt data, a hacker can detect if the attempted attack was successful even without the necessity of testing the decryption result as a password at the respective service. \n\niMobileSitter is different. Here, an attacker cannot decide if the attempt was successful when looking at the decryption results. iMobileSitter accepts all master passwords. It decrypts the stored information on the basis of the given master password, irrespective of whether or not it is correct. However, the software misguides attackers by displaying wrong passwords.\n\nEvery decryption result looks as if it could be correct. For example, if a hacker decrypts a PIN assigned to a debit card using a master password, the decryption result that is returned will always be a four-digit number combination. From an attacker’s point of view - no matter whether hacker or hacking software - it is indistinguishable if the correct master password is found or not. For hacker or hacking software every decryption attempt seems to be successful.\n\nTo determine whether a decryption result is correct, the hacker has no choice but try to login with result at the respective service. There, however, additional security mechanisms of the service take effect after a defined amount of failed logins, e.g., three in the case of a debit card. \n\nFurther information can be found on http://www.imobilesitter.com\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Use of established cryptographic standards: AES, PBKDF2, ISO/IEC9797-1\n- Group your secrets into folders\n- Alphabetic and user defined sorting\n- Search function\n- Easy data backup (Email, iTunes)\n- Encrypted backups\n- Auto Log-Off\n- Easy master password change\n- Easy device replacement\n\nIf you like iMobileSitter, we would be happy if you write a review. Your feedback is always welcome. Please contact us to report any questions, comments or suggestions. Within the iMobileSitter app use \"Options\" > \"Send email\" for contact."

It’s like having a personal editor on your phone or tablet!

We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "TaskTask is the easiest way to get your Outlook or Gmail tasks onto your iPhone! TaskTask directly connects with your Office 365 Business, Exchange on-premises, or Google tasks to keep your full task list in sync between Outlook and your device. Everything is tracked, include all the advanced properties you can see in Outlook. Best of all TaskTask includes flagged items (email!) so you can see your complete task list on the go.\n\nUsing TaskTask, you can manage your to-do list, create tasks, set start/due dates, mark complete, assigning categories, change importance, set and receive reminders, and delete tasks. An Exchange Server or Office 365 account is required to synchronized tasks with Outlook. No additional software is necessary. TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

      "label": "PDFOptim is a simple and intuitive way to compress, optimize and reduce PDF documents on iPhones and iPads. PDFOptim provides easy and effective ways to compress large image and graphics heavy PDF files. Inbuilt side-by-side preview to compare original and optimized PDF.\n\n* * * PDFOptim for Mac is also available on the Mac App Store. * * *\n\nCompressed PDF documents requires less disk space for storage and faster uploads and downloads saves transmission time and cost. The PDFOptim gives you access to compression options to help you to reduce PDF file size without compromising the document's integrity. PDFOptim rewrites the entire PDF documents using selected compression options as efficiently as possible. Some PDF documents might not get compressed, because the PDF documents might be already compressed or have nothing much to compress.\n\nIf your PDF documents are in another app (For Example Mail, DropBox or SkyDrive etc.) that uses the Open In… button, tap the button to open the PDF document in PDFOptim. You can also transfer PDF documents from your desktop computer via iTunes into PDFOptim application on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n- PDF optimization options to set from Image Color Model, Image Resolution, JPEG Image Quality and Optimise graphics level.\n\n- Image color model to choose from RGB, Gray and Mono. Selecting Monochrome color model compression option converts raster PDF contents into black and white which helps reduces PDF file size to greater extent. It is very helpful when compressing scanned books mainly containing text. Optimizing PDF using Monochrome color model can create 24 times smaller PDF compared to RGB color model compression.\n\n- Image resolution ppi (pixels/inch) control to resize raster image contents. Downsampling at lower resolution decrease the file size dramatically.\n\n- Quality control. Set quality from lossless to least for resampling all raster images into PDF. It allows you to control optimized PDF size and viewing quality.\n\n- Optimize graphics option removes superfluous information to reduce vector graphics heavy PDF. Increase in optimize graphics from 'Level 1' to 'Level 5' reduces output PDF file size less to more respectively. Higher optimise graphics level reduces file size but also reduces PDF visual fidelity at higher zoom scale. Choose appropriate Optimize graphics level to balance file size and visual fidelity. Choose Optimize graphics option 'None' to avoid vector graphics optimization.\n\nThis option is very useful when PDF content mainly consist of high precision vector graphics. This option removes such superfluous information, thereby reducing the size of your PDF files. Usually PDF drawing, note-taking and PDF markup apps creates large vector graphics heavy PDF files which can be compressed by this option efficiently.\n\n\n- Password protected PDF documents supported for optimization using correct password.\n\n- Single or multiple optimized PDFs can be shared as single ZIP (*.zip) file.\n\n- Allows Optimized PDFs to Open In… another application, Mail, Message, Print, share PDFs to nearby iOS devices via AirDrop.\n\n- Use Copy to iTunes to save and share optimized PDFs on your desktop computer.\n\n- Real time side-by-side preview of original and optimized PDF. It helps you to compare optimized PDF integrity and quality side-by-side. Synchronized scrolling and zooming controls for both preview showing file size and reduced percentage information.\n\n\nPDF VIEWER:\n\n- Inbuilt PDF viewer with fully selectable and searchable text contents. Select and copy text to clipboard for further use.\n\n- Pinch out and Pinch in to ZoomIn and ZoomOut view.\n\n- Built in search feature to find a character, word or sentence any where in the PDF document.\n\n- Scroll through your document by thumbnail view or Go to page feature.\n\nNote: PDFOptim is standalone application running natively to optimize PDF documents securely on your iOS device.\n\nYou can refer User Manual for any assistance Or Contact Support."

      "label": "Search by Image is a powerful browser extension for Safari that makes effortless reverse image searches possible, and comes with support for more than 30 search engines, such as Google, Bing, Yandex, Baidu and TinEye.\n\nSearch by Image is an open source project made possible thanks to a community of awesome supporters. By purchasing the extension on the App Store, you help support the continued development of the extension.\n\nThe extension helps journalists and researchers verify the authenticity of images, and assists in the identification of false information on social media. Search by Image is also popular among photographers, helping artists explore how their work is shared on the web, while shoppers find it valuable for discovering similar products at discounted prices.\n\nThe extension enables you to search for images from the browser menu with the help of a diverse set of reverse image search engines, which can be toggled and reordered from the extension's options. Visit the wiki for the full list of supported search engines.\n\nhttps://github.com/dessant/search-by-image/wiki/Search-engines\n\nPRO TIPS:\n  • Search with an image by sharing it from Files or Photos.\n  • Tap the Share button in the extension modal to extract an image from a web page and share it to other apps, such as Messages or Notes.\n\nYou may choose to allow the extension to run on every website, or grant access to the current website before a search. When you grant access only to the current website, access must also be granted to each search engine in order to view search results.\n\nImages positioned at the selected area are detected regardless of how they were embedded in the page. The extension also supports searching with images from your device, and images from private sites.\n\nA handful of search modes are offered that serve different use cases. The search mode can be configured from the extension's options.\n\nSearch modes:\n  • Select URL: select an image on the page and search with the image URL. This is the default search mode.\n  • Select image: select an image on the page and search with the image file. This search mode is preferred for sites which do not allow the direct linking of images, such as private sites.\n  • Browse: search with an image from your device. Pasting images from the clipboard is also supported.\n  • URL: search with an image URL.\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please visit the support page to report issues and submit feature requests."

That includes all effects. They do not need to be previously edited into the stream, you can do that while you are streaming from your camera. And the effects will not be lost if you decide to record the stream!\n\nNOTE:\nAir Camera works best if both AppleTV and iOS are updated to the newest version!\n\nThere are some things to keep in mind when streaming sound from a microphone, consider the steps below to make your work more enjoyable:\n    • Reduce Gain/Volume in case of feedback\n    • Experiment with different positions of the iOS device to have additional gain before feedback available\n    • Use an external microphone to plug in your iOS device\n    • Adjust speaker position\nDo not hesitate to drop a line to tell us how you like our app, and also if you don't like it. Tell us what you are missing and we will take a look at it."

      "label": "The PRO version is specifically designed for energy consultants and suppliers of solar panels. A PDF file with your own logo can be used by installers as work order or be attached to estimates.\n\nYou can display your company name under the orientation meter, you can display your logo, company name and website on [Info], add your own list of solar panels and with step 5, the mail with a request for an tender will be send directly to your own mail address.\n\nWith the PRO version you can save a research of a house as a project or reference on your device or in the Cloud. You can save the project in your own or in someone else's Cloud. So you can share your projects between different devices (and colleagues).\n\nThe Standard and PRO version allows you to change the characteristics of a solar panel and change the value of the sun angle in the winter. The settings affect the calculations of the required surface of solar panels on pitched and flat roofs and influence the length of the shadow behind a row of solar panels on a flat roof.\n\nThe orientation meter works like a compass that will display the deviation from the South (or North). You can put the phone on the roof or hold it against the ceiling. In addition, the inclination of the roof will be measured.\n\nIf you are considering installing solar panels, the App can help you in your research whether your roof is suitable for solar panels. The App shows whether there falls enough sunlight on your roof and whether it is worth to install solar panels. You can enter an address or display your current location.\n\nYou can enter the details of your roof and the App will calculate for your roof with multiple types of solar panels the maximum output in the tab ‘Characteristics roof’. \n\nAlso, the required surface of solar panels on pitched and flat roofs are displayed. The App displays the length of the shadow behind a row of solar panels.\n\nRoadmap to get an advice from the App Solar Consult:\n\nStep 1 : Hold the iPhone/iPad against the roof to determine the efficiency of solar panels depending of the angle and orientation.\n\nStep 2 : Check the map with the top view of the location and determine the solar irradiation in your region. On a country map, you can see the solar irradiation of your country. You can also enter a different address or country.\n\nStep 3 : Enter the size of the roof and the App can give you an advice with the maximum number of solar panels that can be installed. You can select a different type of solar panel (this is step 4 on the iPhone).\n\nStep 4 (only iPad) : In addition to the advice of the app, the user can customize the system (4th tab). In case of a skylight or chimney, the user can differ from the advice. This screen is also available in the sidemenu on the iPhone. \n\nStep 5 : Choose tab 5 and enter your details. You can mail the project to your own address or to a supplier for a request."

Timelines is built with all the major data collection capabilities of video analysis software but simplified for ease of use on an iOS device. Collect your data live and export it to match up with the video after the event.\n\n• 3 Tiers of Data Collection\n\nTimelines allows users to dig deeper into their data collection with the inclusion of Clips, Qualifiers and Attributes. Add time-stamped moments to your clips with Qualifiers and then describe these moments further with Attributes.\n\n• Versatile and Flexible MarkUp design\n\nData collection done your own way. Timelines allows users to build their MarkUp from a blank canvas or drag and drop from our MacOS editor, Angles, to collect their data using their own designs and style.\n\n• Inter-button interactions\n\nCapture more data with fewer buttons pushed. No need for in-depth scripting knowledge to make your MarkUp functional as Timelines’ MarkUp design is built for ease. Simply select an action that one button may have on another and click and drag to that button to reduce the number of clicks in your data collection workflows.\n\n• Movable Canvas\n\nCreate MarkUps that guide the user through their data collection steps with actions such as our “Down > Centre”. Users can ensure accurate data collection by moving the canvas with the press of a button; guiding the data collector in exactly the order in which the data should be collected.\n\n• Data Export\n\nUpon completion of your data collection, simply export the timeline that is created via AirDrop or email to your favorite data visualization tool. Timelines can export files as an Angles Timeline directly into Angles, as a JSON file, or as a CSV."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

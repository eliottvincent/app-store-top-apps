Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com\n\nAs the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter. \n\n\nمن صناع Quran.com يأتي تطبيق القرآن للأجهزة المحمولة، تطبيق للمصحف ذو صفحات جميلة خالي تماما من الاعلانات.\n\nلقد أصبح من السهل قراءة القرآن بالشارع، وحفظه، والاستماع إلى قارئك المفضل.\n\nهذا هو مجرد بداية لتطبيق القرآن. سنعمل على تحديث التطبيق بشكل منتظم إن شاء الله، ونحب أن نسمع رأيك ومتطلبتك. يمكنك الوصول إلينا عن طريق البريد الإلكتروني ios@quran.com\n\nعَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة."

      "label": "Book Track is an iPhone, iPad, and Mac app that can track your books — both the ones you own and the ones you hope to own in the future.\n\nAvid readers know how difficult it can be to keep tabs on a growing book collection and that's where Book Track comes into its own by making it quicker and easier than ever to track your reading. Not only can you track all of the books that you own, as well as how far you've read, but you can also keep a wishlist of the books that you'd like to pick up in the future. Whether a book is in your 'Library' or your 'Wishlist,' Book Track displays information and gorgeous cover art for all of them. While Book Track uses information from the internet, more obscure books can also be added manually, too.\n\nBook Track is a free app and is limited to 5 books. A single in-app purchase unlocks support for unlimited books across iPhone and iPad. A separate purchase is required to unlock the full Mac app.\n\nBook Track users can look forward to:\n\n- A synchronized list of books and information — whether you save a book on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, it'll be synced across all devices. Both your Library and Wishlist will be synced seamlessly and automatically so you'll never lose a book again — or buy the same book twice because you forgot you already own it!\n\n- Easy and comprehensive book organization — Every book you add to your Library can be marked as read, reading, or unread, with each book also supporting tags to help you find similar books throughout your collection. Book information like title, author, description, publisher, year of publication, genre, and even the description can also be edited to make your Library as accurate or personal as possible.\n\n- Quote saving — Find a passage within a book that you want to save for later? Book Track can save your favorite quotes in one place so you can read them again later. You can even put them on your Home screen using a widget.\n\n- All the stats, right where you'll see them — Book Track collects library and reading statistics and puts them right on your Home screen with gorgeous widgets. iPad users can enjoy an extra large widget with even more stats, too!\n\n- Support for importing books from services like Goodreads, BookBuddy, Reading List, and more — It's never been easier to import your books from other apps and services so you don't have to start building your library all over again. Book collections can also be exported to PDF and CSV as well.\n\n- Deep integration with iOS and macOS — Book Track includes support for the latest Apple features including Shortcuts and Siri, while Widgets can be used to put your favorite quotes right onto your Home screen.\n\n- Privacy — Book Track doesn't collect any of your personal data and doesn't track you in any way. Books should be fun, not another reason to worry about your data privacy."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

Hadith are made available on this application as a resource for research, personal study, and understanding. The text of one or a few hadith alone are not taken as rulings by themselves; scholars have a sophisticated process using the principles of fiqh to come up with rulings. We do not advocate do-it-yourself fiqh using these hadith for those who are untrained in these principles. If you have a question on a specific ruling, please ask your local scholar."

      "label": "The “Little Stories” series is a collection of fairy tales in which your kid plays the main role. It's quite simple – just enter your kid's name and gender into the settings window and enjoy reading fairy tales about your son or daughter.\n\nTo make it even cooler, we've added beautiful melodies and wonderful pictures to help you raise your child by giving him or her only positive examples. Moreover, you can also make your own audiobooks! Just spend a few minutes to voice-over the story.\n\nLet love and kindness fill your family’s leisure time to make your life and the world around you happier!\n\nWhy “Little Stories”?\n• 1800+ pictures\n• Gender determines the choice of illustrations\n• 45 exciting fairy tales so far and more to come\n• Enchanting music accompanies each story\n• You can create audiobooks by recording your own voice!\n• 1st place in the “Entertainment” category of Rating Runet in 2018!\n• 1st place in the “App For Kids” category of Golden App in 2016!\n• 3rd place in the “Entertainment” category of Golden App in 2017!\n\nWe’d like to tell you more about the process behind creating stories for kids so that you have a better idea about the hard work we put into “Little Stories”.\n\n1) It all begins with searching for an author. He/she can live in any country of the world, but the important thing is that he/she is able to create an interesting and insightful story. Before writing a bedtime story, the author has to read the conditions first. For example, the story may not contain more than 50 scenes (each of which can consist of 146 symbols max.) otherwise the text won’t fit into the app. Once the story has been completed, the next stage can begin.\n\n2) It is now  time to create the storyboard. A storyboard is a selection of simple sketches for each of the illustrations of the story. It gives us a better idea about the visual images of the children’s story.\n\n3) Once the storyboard has been approved, we move on to searching for an illustrator. It should be noted that not all styles might be appropriate for a certain bedtime story and, therefore, it’s important to achieve a perfect fit between the story and the illustration style.\n\n4) Meanwhile, the composer creates the melody. Both the story itself and the artist’s illustrations serve as inspiration for the creation of music. The composer also has conditions to meet: the melody must be soothing and prepare children for a good night’s sleep since most often stories are read for bedtime.\n\n5) What’s more, we also translate our stories for kids into other languages.\n\n6) But that’s not the end! It’s important to see how the book for kids looks inside the app. Line breaks should be checked to make sure the text looks nice and neat. This is done by two professionals: the programmer and the tester.\n\n7) Only after this final step do we release the story for kids. This entire process might take anywhere from two to nine months. So, it’s a hard, but interesting, journey!\n\nWe continuously add new fairy tales to our collection! \nFairy tales are designed for kids aged 3+.\n\nFollow us on: facebook.com/diveomedia"

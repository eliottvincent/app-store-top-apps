From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "Do you want to win real rewards, Robux and other gaming currencies by playing games and trivia? Prickly Bear is a brand new app that rewards you for playing games. Collect Bearbux as you play and spend them on rewards you love. Over 400,000 Robux have been redeemed on Prickly Bear!\n\n“The more I play, the more I earn. I’m saving up my Bearbux for gaming currency and prizes” - Ayen\n\n\"I love how you can earn Bearbux to spend on rewards like Robux and physical items like Lego sets.\" - Guy\n\nPrickly Bear is a learn-to-earn app that helps spark a life-long love of learning in kids. Kids learn subjects – from levelling up on coding, to getting down with the Romans – while pocketing virtual currency for some of their favourite games (like Robux and V-Bucks). Rewards provide a continuous incentive that sets kids up on a virtuous learning circle.\n\nPrickly Bear was made for kids, by parents and kids, and uses insights from neuroscience to create a potent recipe for learning. \n\nWe believe that screens shouldn’t have to be the enemy. Instead, let’s use the strengths of digital technology to inspire a lifelong love of learning in kids.\n\nHow does Prickly Bear work?\n\nHaving Prickly Bear in your pocket is just like having the world’s coolest teacher around – you know, the one that the kids are always talking about. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Sign up and go. Kids sign up, pick a snazzy avatar and start an epic learning adventure. With 70+ hours of cool courses to choose from, there’s bound to be something that gets them excited.\n\n2. Earning by learning. The more time they spend learning and the more courses they complete, the more Bearbux kids will earn. Bearbux is a form of virtual cash that can only be redeemed in certain games that kids love, and which are 100% Prickly-Bear-certified.\n\n3. Exchanging Bearbux. It’s super-easy to convert Bearbux directly into gaming currencies like Robux, V Bucks, Minecoins and more. Once the currencies are in their gamer account, kids can now spend that currency on cool stuff in their chosen game.\n\nPrickly Bear is a neuroscience-backed learning app that helps kids to tap into their potential, and parents to tap out for a while.\n\n- Reward without punishment: Studies have shown that children learn from rewards rather than from punishment. That's why Prickly Bear offers varying degrees of reward to encourage greater effort and determination.\n\n- Recall and retrieval practices: Learning is a matter of recall. Research shows that deliberately recalling information enhances learning and memory formation. Prickly Bear uses proven retrieval practices in our courses to help kids learn and remember more.\n\n- Failure, success, and experience: Learning from experience is fundamental for children. In fact studies show that it's even more effective than learning from instruction. Prickly Bear creates a safe environment for kids to try, fail, and then help them succeed the next time.\n\n- Self-reflection and alternating brain states: Research shows that learning and development requires a balance between external attention and internal reflection. By tapping into both focused and diffuse brain states, Prickly Bear's courses allow kids to develop healthy learning habits.\n\nLearning doesn’t need to be dry and formulaic. Prickly Bear is on a mission to take the grumbling and moaning out of learning – by making it fun. With Prickly Bear having opened your kid’s eyes to the magic of learning, you can feel positive about allowing screen time again — which means more peace and quiet for you!\n\nTerms of use: https://www.pricklybear.io/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://www.pricklybear.io/privacy-policy"

      "label": "Word Tag works\nGet ready to be outsmarted by your kids. This game will increase their vocabulary performance by 43% in just four weeks!\n\nIn 20 minutes of gameplay a day – with eight exposures to every new word over three weeks – you'll see your child's confidence soar and their schoolwork improve. While kids are focused on having fun and acing the game, they will be learning up to 1,000 new words a year, all personalized to their level. The learning happens almost invisibly, so they learn more because they are having fun (and it doesn’t feel like homework). And while they are busy getting all the fun rewards, you can track their advancement on a progress report showing all the pedagogical activities behind the chest of treasures your kid accumulates in the game.\n\nWith characters designed by Craig Kellman (Madagascar, Hotel Transylvania), developed by the brilliant designers of Subway Surfers, crafted on the foundations created by the award-winning team of Mrs Wordsmith, and backed by a stellar team of literacy experts, Word Tag will have a lasting impact in the education and entertainment of the whole family. \nOur unique pedagogical approach was developed and endorsed by Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\n\nHow does it work, you ask? \nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory.\nWe developed several mini-games, to be played in a specific order, carefully scaffolded, with each mini-game building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning.\n\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across four different game activities:\n\nWild Styling Syllables: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word.\n\nWild Styling Synonyms: It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\n\nContext Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\n\nPop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz.\n\nWord Tag uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\n\nThe words kids see are tailored to their needs, including:\n\nCreative writing and literature words\nTextbook words from the Lexile database\n\nUS exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\nUK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\nInspirational words\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\n\nFor more information, have a look through our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

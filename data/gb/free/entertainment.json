Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\n\nA safer online experience for kids\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\n\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again.\nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”.\n\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-8 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 9 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids.\n\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of kids\nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.\n\nOther important information:\nParental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.\nYour kid may also see videos with commercial content from YouTube creators that are not paid ads.The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts managed with Family Link describes our privacy practices when your kid uses YouTube Kids with their Google Account.

Discover what’s on at your local Vue, browse screening times and book your favourite seats – all while on the go. Not sure what you’re in the mood for? Browse what’s currently showing, as well as what’s coming up.\n\nThere’s no more messing around with passwords or long card numbers – you can now log in using Touch ID and we’ve made it easy for you to scan and save your payment cards. And unless you're wearing an invisibility cloak, we’ll use GPS to locate your nearest Vue and tell you what’s showing.\n\nIf you say it’s okay, we’ll send you offers straight to your phone, chosen just for you. All our regular deals are up for grabs, including Mini Mornings (where kids and adults both pay £2.49), Meerkat Movies and discounted tickets on Super Days. Experience big screen intensity with our IMAX screenings or step inside the action with 3D. You can also upgrade to a VIP or Recliner, the best seats for full-focus, full comfort entertainment. \n\nIt’s not all behind-the-scenes stuff either – we’ve worked hard to pack the best bits of the big screen into your small screen, so the experience starts before you’ve stepped inside the venue."

Our complex algorithms use the depth data to detect people and people shaped objects with accuracy that surpasses that of the Kinect SLS cameras. For devices lacking LiDAR, the app will instead rely on dual lens cameras to measure depth in a similar way to how the human eye detects depth. Read more about how it works at GhostTube.com\n\nGhostTube SLS Camera uses advanced sensors in your device to detect depth and human shaped objects that surpass the accuracy of the traditional Kinect used by many paranormal investigators. Don't pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for a modified gaming console - GhostTube SLS Camera is available FREE for download and can be used as an SLS Camera in all of your paranormal investigations.\n\nFor more paranormal investigation and ghost hunting tools, check out our other apps.\n\nGhostTube SLS Camera offers auto renewable subscriptions. Refer to our website for a full list of terms and conditions, including those relating to auto-renewable subscriptions: GhostTube.com/terms\n\nAlthough GhostTube SLS Camera offers some low light filters, the app is not intended as an aid for seeing in the dark.

Thanks to new technologies, a modern 46” narrow frame OLED TV is approximately the same size as a 40” LCD TV from 2008.

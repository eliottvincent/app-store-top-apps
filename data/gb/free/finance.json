No deposits or sneaky fees and getting a quote takes minutes.\n\n— How long is temporary?—\nTemporary insurance can last as little as 1 hour and can stretch up to 28 days. Once you’re insured, you can top up on even more time too.\n\n— Can I get insured on someone else’s car?—\nYes! In fact, getting insured on someone else’s car is as easy as insuring your own. It makes borrowing a car from a friend, family, or neighbour really quick and simple.\n\n— How does it help me save money?—\nCuvva customers save by not having to pay a deposit, and not paying any sneaky admin fees. This means you can save cash for the more important things.\n\n— Can I get insured for longer than 28 days?—\nYes! When you sign up for a subscription, you’ll be billed for insurance monthly. There are no deposits or sneaky fees and 0% APR.\n\nCuvva is authorised and regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority. Our FCA reference number is 690273.

The kind of things that let you stop wasting time filling in forms or rolling your eyes while waiting on phone lines.\n\nTake a look at a few of the things you can do in the app:\n\n• Set up and change your Direct Debits\n• Sign in with Face or Touch ID or a passcode\n• Temporarily block a card or report it lost or stolen\n• Make payments and find out when your next payment is due\n• Update your contact details\n• View PIN\n• Check your balance and how much you’ve got to spend\n• See transactions\n• Register multiple Capital One cards"

And then getting everything sorted for your mortgage application. It sounds daunting, but it doesn’t have to be.\n\nWe’ve built Nude to make saving (or investing) for your first home way more simple. So whether you’re at square one, or already on your way, we can help you get your keys in record time.\n\nHere’s how:\n - Set a goal and find out how much you may need for your deposit and other expenses using real-life UK house prices.\n\n - See how long it could take by telling the app how much you can set aside each month and how much you’ve already put away. \n\n - Get up to £1,000 towards your first home every year (tax free!) by opening a Nude Lifetime ISA or transferring your existing Lifetime ISA to Nude. \n\n - Connect your bank to keep track of your spending and get fresh ideas that could help you buy your first home faster. \n\n\nLet’s get you a home. \n\n–––\n\nOur Cash & Stocks & Shares LISAs \nThe 25% bonus and tax-free benefits of these accounts depend on government policy and tax rules, which can change at any time. Government early withdrawal charge may apply. \n\nOur Stocks & Shares LISA\nIf you open a Nude Stocks & Shares Lifetime ISA, it's important that you know the value of your investment could go up as well as down. You could get back less than you put in, which means it would take you longer to buy your first home. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future and investing is not intended to be a short-term option. We can't and don't provide financial advice so please be sure that investment risk is right for you.\n\nNude Finance Limited (company number 12008146) is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FRN: 928010) and registered as an account information services provider (FRN: 913654).\n\n–––"

Pick an all-time classic (like the Mighty Meaty), discover a new pizza (like the Vegan PepperoNAY), design your own creation, or even customise one of your favourites.\n\nDiscounts\n\nDownload now, and you’ll have the very best local offers at your fingertips, enabling you to find great value deals to suit your budget. You can even add vouchers in-app to get exclusive discounts on your order.\n\nGroup ordering\n\nThe app allows you to create a group order with friends, family, or anyone you like. Simply send them each a group invite, and they’ll be able to select the items they want to include in your order. Whether you’re the host or a guest — this is great for large groups with lots of people. \n\nDeals\n\nNeed help finding a deal?  Use our Deal Wizard - add items from the menu, then go to the basket to check out the savings. Simple! We will try and match the items you’ve added to a deal but you can always still apply a voucher from the store or add your own voucher code instead.\n\nFood delivery or takeaway\n\nAll app orders give you a choice of delivery or collection options, including contact-free and In-Car Collection in selected stores — where you can get your pizza delivered straight to your car, safely and hassle-free.\n\nPayment options\n\nYou can pay however you like, using card, PayPal or with just a few taps thanks to Apple Pay. Some stores may still be accepting cash too.

We’re just getting started. \nEnjoy maximum taste with minimal waste and support your community’s hard-working independents with a food delivery app that drops the freshest, greenest groceries on your doorstep. \nAll of the fresh produce in our grocery shopping app is supplied by independent farmers, dairies, bakers, and tasty treat makers, before being delivered in plastic free, return-and-reuse, recyclable, or compostable packaging. \nHere’s a taste of what you can buy on our grocery delivery app: \n* Baked goods that make reducing waste a piece of cake. \n* Seasonal fruit and veg that’s fresh from the farm and causing the planet no harm. \n* Refillable cleaning products that keep things spotless, without making a mess of the environment. \n* Cereals that eat waste for breakfast, so you don’t have to. \n* Dairy produce that’s butter for the planet. \n … And, of course, milk! \nWith a mouthwatering range of fresh UK groceries available online for home delivery, this ain’t no ordinary fresh milk delivery app. \nWhatever you need, our milkies will bring it right to your doorstep in sustainable packaging, delivering up to three times a week to cut down food miles, waste, single-use plastics, and those pesky trips to the shop. \nWe’re not like other food delivery apps. Our motto is, convenience with a conscience. And by signing up, you get: \nEasy weekly or one-time ordering on our app or website. \nNext day delivery if you order by 8pm. \nFree return-and-reuse bottle collection, to give the planet a much-needed breather, and your wheelie bin a well-deserved day off. \nA personal plastic-saved counter, which lets you track the positive environmental impact of your milkround. \n8 million pieces of plastic enter landfills and our oceans every day, damaging our water supplies, landscapes, and wonderful wildlife. One-third of the world’s food also goes to waste, increasing the nasty greenhouse gases swarming the planet we call home. But it doesn’t have to be this way.  \nThis year, we’re aiming to save 50 million plastic bottles from entering landfill and our oceans. But we need your help.  \nSingle-use plastics are made to be used and abused. Our planet isn’t. Join us on our app or website, and banish waste to the past, along with shell suits, mullets and MSN Messenger. \nWill you join your neighbours in the fight against waste?"

Quickly search for a food (eggs, chicken, strawberries, anything!) and feel confident in exactly how to prepare it for baby.\n\nWith a paid subscription, you can record baby's progress with a digital food log, track baby's favorite foods, make a list of foods you'd like to try later, and track any foods baby has had a reaction to which you can share with doctors and caregivers.  \n\nThis app will be a crucial tool to help you to raise a healthy, happy eater, avoid picky eating, and enjoy family meals!"

Using patented software algorithms, the MEATER® app will give you cook time estimates, and guide you towards the juiciest steak, chicken, turkey, fish or other cut of meat that you've ever cooked.\n\nIt’s time to break free from the kitchen or grill and let the MEATER® app monitor your food for you. When your food is ready, you'll receive audio and visual notifications on your smart device. This way, you can stop watching your food cook, giving you more time to focus on the things that matter the most to you.\n\n* Unlike other smart meat thermometers, MEATER® is completely wireless! All of the electronics are contained inside the MEATER® probe, eliminating the need for any external wires.\n\n* Easily connect up to four MEATER® probes at once to cook every steak exactly the way each person likes them.\n\n* The smart Guided Cook™ system lets you know how long to cook your food, when to remove it from heat, and how long to let it rest. Simply select the type of meat, cut, and cook you want in the MEATER® app, then sit back and relax as perfect results are achieved.\n\n* For veteran chefs, fully customizable cooking and alert options are available to give you total control over your cooking experience.\n\n* Access your complete cooking history with ‘Previous Cooks’ so you can repeat your favorites whenever you want.\n\nCook smarter with MEATER®!

      "label": "Found a recipe on the internet that looks great? Yum! Add it to Whisk and start creating your personal cookbook. Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com. We want to make sure your Whisk experience is the best it can be!"

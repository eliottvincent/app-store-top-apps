Pick an all-time classic (like the Mighty Meaty), discover a new pizza (like the Vegan PepperoNAY), design your own creation, or even customise one of your favourites.\n\nDiscounts\n\nDownload now, and you’ll have the very best local offers at your fingertips, enabling you to find great value deals to suit your budget. You can even add vouchers in-app to get exclusive discounts on your order.\n\nGroup ordering\n\nThe app allows you to create a group order with friends, family, or anyone you like. Simply send them each a group invite, and they’ll be able to select the items they want to include in your order. Whether you’re the host or a guest — this is great for large groups with lots of people. \n\nDeals\n\nNeed help finding a deal?  Use our Deal Wizard - add items from the menu, then go to the basket to check out the savings. Simple! We will try and match the items you’ve added to a deal but you can always still apply a voucher from the store or add your own voucher code instead.\n\nFood delivery or takeaway\n\nAll app orders give you a choice of delivery or collection options, including contact-free and In-Car Collection in selected stores — where you can get your pizza delivered straight to your car, safely and hassle-free.\n\nPayment options\n\nYou can pay however you like, using card, PayPal or with just a few taps thanks to Apple Pay. Some stores may still be accepting cash too. Plus, our super-helpful order tracker lets you follow your pizza at every stage of delivery, from dough ball to doorbell.\n\nPre-order food\n\nOur pre-order option allows you to order your pizza earlier in the day, and then get it delivered at a time of your choosing. Your last Domino’s order will always be available to re-order at the touch of a button and by holding down your app icon you can quickly shortcut to your last order, menu, deals or to find a store near you.\nDownload the Domino’s app to view all of our pizzas, sides, chicken wings, drinks, and desserts — as well as our healthy eating options — and order them all in one place.\n\nIn the mood for Domino’s?

Quickly search for a food (eggs, chicken, strawberries, anything!) and feel confident in exactly how to prepare it for baby.\n\nWith a paid subscription, you can record baby's progress with a digital food log, track baby's favorite foods, make a list of foods you'd like to try later, and track any foods baby has had a reaction to which you can share with doctors and caregivers.  \n\nThis app will be a crucial tool to help you to raise a healthy, happy eater, avoid picky eating, and enjoy family meals!"

Our eco-friendly, sustainable grocery delivery app has helped save over 32 million plastic bottles from landfill, with each customer saving 100 on average per year. And guess what? We’re just getting started. \nEnjoy maximum taste with minimal waste and support your community’s hard-working independents with a food delivery app that drops the freshest, greenest groceries on your doorstep. \nAll of the fresh produce in our grocery shopping app is supplied by independent farmers, dairies, bakers, and tasty treat makers, before being delivered in plastic free, return-and-reuse, recyclable, or compostable packaging. \nHere’s a taste of what you can buy on our grocery delivery app: \n* Baked goods that make reducing waste a piece of cake. \n* Seasonal fruit and veg that’s fresh from the farm and causing the planet no harm. \n* Refillable cleaning products that keep things spotless, without making a mess of the environment. \n* Cereals that eat waste for breakfast, so you don’t have to. \n* Dairy produce that’s butter for the planet. \n … And, of course, milk! \nWith a mouthwatering range of fresh UK groceries available online for home delivery, this ain’t no ordinary fresh milk delivery app. \nWhatever you need, our milkies will bring it right to your doorstep in sustainable packaging, delivering up to three times a week to cut down food miles, waste, single-use plastics, and those pesky trips to the shop. \nWe’re not like other food delivery apps. Our motto is, convenience with a conscience. And by signing up, you get: \nEasy weekly or one-time ordering on our app or website. \nNext day delivery if you order by 8pm. \nFree return-and-reuse bottle collection, to give the planet a much-needed breather, and your wheelie bin a well-deserved day off. \nA personal plastic-saved counter, which lets you track the positive environmental impact of your milkround. \n8 million pieces of plastic enter landfills and our oceans every day, damaging our water supplies, landscapes, and wonderful wildlife. One-third of the world’s food also goes to waste, increasing the nasty greenhouse gases swarming the planet we call home. But it doesn’t have to be this way.  \nThis year, we’re aiming to save 50 million plastic bottles from entering landfill and our oceans. But we need your help.  \nSingle-use plastics are made to be used and abused. Our planet isn’t. Join us on our app or website, and banish waste to the past, along with shell suits, mullets and MSN Messenger. \nWill you join your neighbours in the fight against waste?"

      "label": "Found a recipe on the internet that looks great? Yum! Add it to Whisk and start creating your personal cookbook. Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com. We want to make sure your Whisk experience is the best it can be!"

      "label": "How many times have you found yourself looking for that perfect recipe – only to find that you’re missing one or more ingredients?\n\nHow many times have you opened the fridge and thought to yourself -- what can I make ?\n\nHow many times have you thrown away an ingredient, because you couldn't figure out how to use it before it expired ?\n\nSuperCook to the rescue!\n\nUnlike other recipe apps,  SuperCook only shows you recipes that require the ingredients you already have.  \n\nAll the recipes you see on SuperCook  are recipes you can make right now.  No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends\n\nWhy purchase new ingredients when you can focus on what you already have?\n\nHere’s how it works:\n• For Supercook to do its magic, it needs to know all the ingredients you have at home.\n• Visit the pantry page in the SuperCook app and choose from a list of 2000+ ingredients broken down into categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, and many more. \n• Start adding ALL the ingredients you have at home to your SuperCook pantry – including oils, spices, and yes - even that old bottle of Worcestershire sauce in the back of the fridge!\n• Sit back and watch SuperCook work its magic by finding recipes that match your ingredients.\n\nSuperCook’s Unique App Features:\n \n--Customized Recipe Ideas--\nWe’ve consolidated over 11 million recipes from 18,000 recipe websites, in 20 languages to create the largest recipe collection ever.   This knowledge was fed into an AI system that learnt the intricacies of all ingredients and how they can be mixed together.\n\nAll you have to do is build your pantry on the app – and you’re ready to make delicious meals without ever leaving your house!\n\nSuperCook will find you any recipe you need, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a midnight snack.  \n\n--Easily Add Your Ingredients--\nSave time and money with an intelligent pantry. SuperCook’s voice dictation mode allows you to quickly add ingredients to your in-app pantry by simply saying them out loud.\n\nJust open your fridge, click the microphone button, and start listing everything inside. The app will automatically add the ingredients to your pantry for a quick and easy way to find recipes!\n \n--Automatic Recipe Recommendations--\nThe app will automatically find you recipes to make with what’s in your fridge – so all those lost ingredients in the back of your cupboard now have a place on your table.  It’s that simple!\n\nWhen you run out of an ingredient, simply open the SuperCook app and remove it from your pantry -  and all the recipe ideas will adjust accordingly.\n \n--Get Creative in the Kitchen--\nSuperCook inspires new ideas and activities in the kitchen for new cooks, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike.\n\nWith over 11 million recipes available in 20 different languages, SuperCook promises that you’ll never cook the same thing twice (unless you want to, of course!).\n\n--What's on the menu ?--\nThe menu page is where you'll find all your recipe ideas.  Why is it called menu?  Because just like the menu in a restaurant, everything on the menu page is available to you now.  SuperCook instantly analyzes 11 million recipes and finds the ones that match your unique ingredients.\n\nMost likely your menu page will contain thousands of recipes, but don't worry, we've broken them down into helpful categories like soups and stews, appetizers and snacks, salads, entrees, desserts and more.\n\n--Reduce food waste--\nMost people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. SuperCook is one of the best ways to reduce food waste in the home.   It finds recipes that use as many of your ingredients as possible, so nothing goes to waste.    SuperCook makes food waste prevention fun and easy, just open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe.   We help you use what you have, so nothing goes to waste!"

In every issue and on every page Easy Cook shows readers how it is possible to cook from scratch using fresh ingredients – without spending hours in the kitchen. We always use clear, straight-forward, easy to understand language in our recipes so that having a copy of Easy Cook to hand while cooking is like having a good friend with you in the kitchen.\n\nThe magazine is divided into five distinct sections: \n\nSPEEDY MEALS is where you’ll find a whole range of quick and easy recipes, all ready and on the table in 30 minutes or less. Our '20 Quick Weeknight Meals’ feature starts this section and takes you straight into a month of mouthwatering recipes - just what you need after a busy day at work or when the kids come home hungry from school.  \n \nEASY ENTERTAINING is the section to turn to when you’re having friends over for a meal or cooking Sunday lunch for the family. The recipes are still quick to prepare, thanks to our time-saving tricks and clever shortcuts, but they look really impressive and taste wonderful.  \n \nGET BAKING is where we show you how to get perfect results every time with our straightforward, delicious recipes for sweet and savoury bakes. There are everyday ideas - perfect for lunchboxes, for example - and special occasion treats too.\n \nTV COOKS - here we bring you the very best ideas from the BBC’s talented TV cooks, with recipes chosen because they’re easy to make and because they offer you the chance to try out ingredients or flavour combinations you might not have used before.  \n \nEASY COOK COOKERY SCHOOL - Each month you can learn  a new technique or skill, designed to speed up your cooking and help you make the most of the time you spend in the kitchen. The step-by-step instructions are clearly photographed so they’re easy to follow, and we give you a selection of different recipes as well so you can put your new skills into practice straightaway. \n\nSubscriptions and Single Issues\n\nCustomers can buy single issues and subscriptions using In App Purchase\n \nSubscriptions are available on monthly or annual terms.\n \n• Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period \n• You will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for that product \n• You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings after purchase \n• No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.

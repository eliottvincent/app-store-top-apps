We know that there is a huge amount of information available at your fingertips, but finding something that provides clear and accurate information is not always easy!\n\nThe resources on the Healthier Together have been developed in partnership between parents and NHS healthcare professionals. You'll find clear information on common childhood illnesses, including advice on what 'red-flag' signs to look out for, where to seek help if required, what you should do to keep your child comfortable and how long your child's symptoms are likely to last.\n\nMost importantly, the resources are used not only by parents but also by healthcare professionals. This means that your child is likely to receive consistently high-quality care, irrespective of which healthcare provider you take them to see. And their advice is likely to mirror that on Healthier Together. Reducing unnecessary variation improves the overall quality of care and reduces the parental anxiety that inconsistent advice generates\n\nThe NHS Healthier Together app has been designed to allow you to access care for your child much more easily. If your child is unwell and needs to be seen by a healthcare professional, instead of having to call your GP surgery, you will be able to use the app to directly inform your GP about your child’s symptoms. Your GP practice will then contact you to decide what needs to be done. And if you are seeking help when your GP surgery is shut, it will direct you to NHS 111. Lots of other parents have already downloaded it and have found it extremely useful."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

Enhanced Rule of Nines using BMI and Rule of Eights for infants under 10 kg and adults over 80 kg using the Rule of Fives.\n\nThe Total Surface Burn Area (TBSA) is calculated from the drawn regions using the Rule of Nines, Eights, Fives or Lund and Browder. Along with the patient’s weight, height, gender, and chart-type (adult, child, infant), the Parkland Formula is used to determine an accurate amount of fluids to give the patient. Additionally, the provided Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI) can then provide an estimated mortality rate. \n\nKEY FEATURES\nCreate, View, Sort, Search, Edit, and More - Unlike other calculation software, you can view and revise past records. Organize the chart list view by select fields or find results by customized title.\n\nQuick, Efficient and Detailed Calculations - Edit quickly with simple inputs using Quick Calculate. Bypass patient measurement information to quickly draw burn regions and return to add patient details later.\n\nEncrypted & Compliant - Patient charts are stored locally with high-level encryption.\n\nEnhanced Rules - An available option in the application considers the latest medical studies to calculate more accurately based on BMI and body-type.\n\nProfessional Editing Tools - Use the basic Brush tool commonly seen in other software or take advantage of the Lasso tool to quickly draw the entire burn region in one motion!\n\nPan and Zoom! - Two-Finger-Pan, Touch-to-Pan, Pinch-to-Zoom, and more allow for precision results and faster burn region input.\n\nReverse-draw - Reverse side is drawn under the current view to allow the burn pattern to be matched from the anterior to the posterior.\n\nVector-based Graphics - Utilizing point-to-point Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) stores the burn region as a digital value for: Better precision feedback / display, future-proofing as calculations and formulas change, and more.\n\nShare Results - Charts are exportable using the native devices 'Share' feature. Subscribe or purchase individual 'Share Charts' items for full calculation details and advanced file-types such as PDF.\n\nTailored Preferences - Default opening a chart to Move mode to prevent accidental input, or default to Edit mode for faster input.\n\nCustom Basis Values - Enter your weighted basis value that best suits your knowledge and expertise or facility guidelines. Available for adult and child/infant charts separately.\n\nFAQs\nQ. How do calculations work?\nA. Anterior and Posterior body regions are divided into an average total of 35 different parts (hand, lower arm, upper arm, etc.). Each section is then combined into the respective region for display purposes (arm, leg) to give the total value for a more user-friendly view. The system then reduces and evaluates each collection of regions and determines the percentage of the clipped area that is filled-in. Each collection is then totaled and input into the Parkland Formula to determine the amount of fluids to provide.\n\nQ. How are records stored securely?\nA. Patient charts are stored locally with AES-256 using cipher block chaining (CBC) mode and a unique initialization vector (IV) which is never reused within a file, and then signed with a SHA-2 HMAC.\n\nAll data collected is encrypted and used to provide recommendations. All information displayed should be verified and only used with the assistance or advice of a trained licensed professional. Sharing charts is not secure, and is subject to the encryption mechanisms used in the transfer to the selected 3rd-party application(s).\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Go through all checks, the scores will be automatically added. The higher the score the sicker the baby is likely to be. This app has been designed to help you decide whether your baby needs a doctor.  Although it is accurate most of the time, its advice cannot be guaranteed. If you are still worried about your baby, consult a doctor.\n\nThe Lullaby Trust Baby Check was developed from a 4-year project which analysed the signs and symptoms of illness in over 1,000 babies under 6 months of age. There were 300 well babies at home and 700 babies in hospital with a variety of illnesses. All signs and symptoms were analysed to find the combination which could be used to assess the severity of a baby’s illness with the most accuracy. The 19 signs and symptoms now used in Baby Check were found to give the most accurate assessment.\n \nThe accuracy and acceptability of The Lullaby Trust Baby Check has been tested in several field trials.\n \n Acknowledgments:\nThe parents and babies who assisted with the research project and: The Friends of the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths; Australian Institute of Health; Ross Trust; Felton Bequests; H & L Hecht Trust; Percy Baxter Charitable Trust; A Williams Private Fund.

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

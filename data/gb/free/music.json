Unlock it with Media Rewards. Members help brands, and media companies make some crucial decisions to help improve media content and advertising experiences. Depending on your location or the specific audience measurement study that you are selected for, you can earn a variety of rewards, such as gift cards, cash rewards, 3rd party rewards, cash points or sweepstakes.\n\nHow to join?\n\nIt’s easy. It’s automatic. All you need to do is claim your invite code via an invite or via a friend referral and install the app. Once set up, you can go about your day as you normally would and earn points by keeping the app installed. \n\nMore information\n\nMedia Rewards allows you to automatically identify and share which TV, radio and outdoor ads and retail outlets you are exposed to, so we can offer you more relevant surveys and contextually relevant content.\nThe app requests access to your microphone to match audio patterns from TV and radio content and advertisements within proximity of your smartphone and matches those with the stored ones in the database. This won’t affect your privacy or daily battery life. Audio is never recorded and conversations cannot be identified. Nobody wants that. We take the privacy of our users very seriously and go the extra mile to protect it. All data collection is secure and data anonymised."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

      "label": "London Congestion Charge App allows for hassle-free and easy on-the-go congestion zone travel, charge tracking and management.\n\nBe you a minicab driver, a delivery person or just an occasional driver - you’ll find this app tremendously useful for your everyday trips to downtown London.\nOne of its greatest advantages is fully automated workflow. The app tracks user’s location via the GPS, so there is absolutely no need to carry a notebook with you or manually fill in locations and times. \n\nWe are not TfL!\n\nWe are not associated with TfL, nor is our app connected to their systems. We cannot show you your entry/exit history prior to the installation of the app. If you are unsure about prior charges please call TfL directly as soon as possible\n\nHow to Use\n\nThe app uses your GPS location and is not connected to TfL. The main purpose of the app is navigation assistance so you can avoid driving into the Zone as much as possible and also to remind you about your possible entries, so that you can contact the TfL and make a payment. Please bear in mind that the app relies on your phone connectivity, so if you are ever in doubt about entering the Zone contact the TfL urgently.\n\nWhen you’re out of the zone – the app will show the distance to the closest entry to the zone.\nJust open the app and find out whether you are inside the zone or not. The green notification area in the bottom of the screen means you’re out of the zone, whereas the red one – when you’re in. \nYou’ll get a push notification each time you cross the Zone’s border – both on entry and exit.\n\nOnce located within a zone, users can track all their past entries in the journey diary and find charge listings inside, all collated by date. If you cross the Zone at least once, you’ll see a diary indicator. The app is aware of Congestion Charge Zone scheduling and tracks charges accordingly.\n\nProvided cloud-based premium service:\nHistory Access Subscription\nLength of subscription is 1 month.\nPrice of subscription is 2.99 GBP per month.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\nSubscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n\nPrivacy Policy \nhttps://www.londonappworks.co.uk/apps/privacy-policy/congestion-charge/\n\nTerms of Use \nhttps://www.londonappworks.co.uk/apps/terms-of-use/congestion-charge/\n\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable."

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

Well, its replacement is here and it's called Delm8.\n\nDelm8 helps you easily find properties such as new builds, farms and cottages by their names which is very helpful :)\n\nDelm8 app is very well supported by a UK based, always online support personnel on facebook, phone and email. Please search Delm8 mobile app and like our fb page, we will be very happy to welcome you there. \n\nAs a professional driver using only the postcode for navigation is very inefficient because postcodes are shared by several properties, meaning your destination is the centre of the postcode area and not the front door that you need - this is the problem solved by Delm8.\n\nDelm8 uses clever algorithms to help drivers find addresses all over the country and then navigating to them using their actual geographic coordinates meaning you’ll find yourself at the front door and not somewhere in the vicinity. This will shave off minutes and stress from each courier drop\n\nSubscription Terms: \nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24h before current period ends. \nPayment is charged to your iTunes account. \nManage subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal in Account Settings.\nCancel Anytime."

AppyParking+ London Parking will even show you when you can park your car on single yellow lines!\nSo whether you’re in London, Manchester, Birmingham or Liverpool (or any of the other 450 UK towns and cities we’ve mapped), it  has never been easier to find parking thanks to AppyParking+ London Parking.\n\nUpgrade Your Car Parking Intelligence So You Can Drive And Park With Ease \n \nWith AppyParking+ London Parking you get a sixth sense for parking thanks to the incredible detail the app surfaces for drivers. Park and pay and pay for parking the way that suits you. Zoom in for bay by bay detail and tap a pin to expand all the key information such as restriction type, operating hours, tariffs, pricing and maximum stay rules. Got an EV or a Blue Badge? Just set your preferences to these bay types when you’re searching for where to drive and park your car.. We've also got you covered for specific journeys to hospitals, airports and train stations, with onsite and nearby parking options mapped so you can make the best decision to meet your needs and start parking ASAP..\n\nSave Time and Reduce Emissions by Navigating Directly To Your Parking Space\n \nOur handy navigation tool will seamlessly direct you from point A to point B, even if your point A is in London and your point B is in Glasgow. After you select your preferred parking space location, the app will navigate you directly there. This means less time driving around looking for a parking space, which means less fuel wasted and more money in your pocket.\n\nArrive On Time Every Time\n \nBefore you have even started your journey, AppyParking+ London Parking will provide you with a walking route and ETA from your parking space location to your final destination.\n\nMake Payments At The Touch Of A Button\n \nIt has never been easier to park and pay for parking than with our parking app. When you can’t park your car in a free cashless parking space, which unfortunately happens sometimes in busy cities like London, making a payment couldn’t be simpler. With our in-app payment feature, we can connect you directly with all parking payment providers, as well as provide the relevant parking space information that can be copy and pasted with ease.\n\nAppyParking+ London Parking - Easy UK Parking. Make Parking Forgettable.\n\nTerms of Use: https://appyway.com/v2-terms-of-use/"

      "label": "Make the most of your adventures in the great outdoors with OS Locate. Used alongside your Ordnance Survey map, OS Locate is a fast and highly accurate means of pinpointing your exact location on the map, anywhere in Great Britain. If you have lost your bearings or simply would like a little reassurance, OS Locate is the ideal companion for all enthusiasts of the great outdoors.\n\nThe app converts GPS location readings from your mobile phone to Ordnance Survey National Grid references, enabling you to determine precisely where you are on an Ordnance Survey map. No mobile signal? No problem; OS Locate does not require a mobile signal to function – the inbuilt GPS system can be relied upon, even in the most remote areas.\n\nSimply download the app and switch on your device’s location services (Settings – Privacy – Location services).\n\nOS Locate is packed with additional features. The ‘Share’ button allows you to connect with friends and family via messaging and social media – let them know where you are, how your adventure is progressing and what time you will be home. Use the handy digital compass to take your bearings – always ensuring you are on the right track. For those who are keen to learn more about maps and navigation, the ‘About’ button hosts a wealth of information including hints and tips and a guide to map reading. In addition, you will find simple yet comprehensive guides on how to use eastings and northings.\n\nOS Locate – know where you are.\n\nOS Locate is a complementary tool for Ordnance Survey paper maps. You should always have an Ordnance Survey paper map and baseplate compass when exploring the great outdoors.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nPlease ensure your Location Services are turned on.\n\nOS Locate has been updated to provide even greater peace of mind by providing accurate altitude information. As this is taken from the GPS signal, it will always be available. \n\nAlso new for version 1.1, OS Locate will automatically detect whether you are outside Great Britain, and convert Ordnance Survey’s Northing and Easting location information into internationally recognised Latitude and Longitude readings, which can be used anywhere in the world.\n\nFinally, Ordnance Survey has partnered with Silva Compasses to update the virtual compass feature to use Silva’s trademarked design for greater usability."

No one outside of your trusted circle will be able to see your location, not strangers or big brother.\n\n- Street crime reports: Visualise serious street crime reports as icons with the WalkSafe Map, all information is based on verified police crime data. \n\n- Community safety: Help others by posting safety icons to the WalkSafe map. All community icons are verified by admins to uphold user safety.\n\n- Hotspot Alerts: Get alerts when you walk near areas that have seen reports of serious crimes such as knife attacks, sexual assault, violent attacks and muggings.\n\n- SOS button: Alert ALL of your trusted friends even if they are not viewing your location.\n\nPERSONAL SAFETY TOOLS\n\nNo one can predict where the next crime will be.

Your location will update in real-time allowing your loved ones to keep you safe on your journey.\n\n- Activity Map: Our map shows police and WalkSafe community reports of dangers such as knife crime, sexual assault & mugging​​.

      "label": "\"Probably the best map and route planner out there\" - recent customer review\nDon't take our word for it, join over 1 million users who rely on this app daily.\n\n● TRAVEL AT NIGHT ●\n● Now contains routing for the latest TfL night services.\n\n● KEY FEATURES ●\n● Simple, fast and easy to use.\n● Designed for the first time visitor and experienced commuter.\n● Unique \"Travel Explorer\" feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map.\n● Latest official TfL (Transport for London) map. \n● Saves and recalls favourite and recent journeys.\n● Online street map integration (when an internet connection is available).\n● Services can be turned on or off, routing around problems.\n● Easily locates your nearest transport stop.\n● Places of interest, parks etc are built in to the application.\n● Ability to mark up the map with favourite locations and areas.\n\n● OVERVIEW ● The London Underground application is a superb route planner for the London Underground system with many unique features. The inbuilt map provides the official view of the city underground services with the ability to switch to an online street map view when an internet connection is available. This way the user can view the online map feature when above ground and the transport map and route planning is still fully functional underground or anywhere there is no internet connection. \n\n● TRAVEL EXPLORER ● The unique travel explorer feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map. This is helpful for getting a sense of scale and connectivity of the transport system and can provide some interesting results. For example is it quicker to use the tube to go from Covent Garden to Tottenham Court Road or is it quicker on foot? (Hint, the quickest route will keep you fitter). No other application makes it so easy to get around on the tube and allow you to make travel decisions based on the actual distances and travel times on foot.\n\n● ROUTING ● Does not require an internet connection and will always be available to display a clear and detailed view of the city transport system, plus list and animate the optimum route for your journey. Provides the fastest route calculations of any mobile routing application (virtually instantaneous) using actual published journey times with the ability to select the quickest route or the route with the least changes.\nComprehensive details of your planned route are provided, including changes, directions of travel, number of stops, predicted journey times, etc. Uniquely this application gives you “direction”, “towards” and “service frequency” information (not available on any other offline journey planner) for example “Take the Northern line (Southbound) towards Stockwell for 10 mins (6 stops). Service runs every 7 minutes” which is essential when finding the correct platform and connection. Also given are alternatives for each leg of the journey.\n\n● NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED ● The map and routing do not require an internet connection and you will not be charged data connection fees. This also means the application runs perfectly underground, on an aeroplane, etc. For international visitors to a city who have data roaming turned off this is an ideal solution.\n\n● LIVE INFO ● When an internet connection is available, optional \"Live Information\" on the current state of the transport services and real time station departure boards can be viewed allowing you to plan your journeys in advance and avoid any potential delays.\n\n● MORE MAPS ● This map is one in a series of Zuti worldwide city maps, if you like this product you may also enjoy some of our other offerings, please visit www.zuti.co.uk for further information. This is the promotional version of the application, please see the app store for the advert free version.\n\n● NOTE ● Please note this is the free promotional (Pro) version and does contain advertising."

In-App purchase can be used to remove the bottom advertisement and to support us.\n\nThis application does not need an internet connection and works best in outdoors.\n\nBy default, it uses device sensor to determine the elevation from see level, but you also have the option to use NOAA data files to get the altitude of your location. On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

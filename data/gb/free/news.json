You can receive local alerts for FREE simply by downloading the OWL app. No registration or login necessary.\n\nThe OWL app works across all of Hertfordshire and half of London. \n\nParticipating London boroughs include: Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Enfield, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Richmond upon Thames and Wandsworth.\n\nAdditional boroughs are supported via email alerts only if you register at https://www.owl.co.uk for free. These boroughs include Barking & Dagenham, Hackney, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest.\n\nThis app alerts you to incidents near to where you live or at your current location. Choose the postcode zones you're interested in and receive notifications the moment the police or council send a new alert to that area. \n\nIf you get too many notifications you can switch them off and just read the latest alerts within the app, or if you don't get enough you can switch on notifications for all alerts in your borough.\n\nOWL is supported by Hertfordshire Constabulary and also the Metropolitan Police in half of London Boroughs. For 16 years OWL has helped protect residents and businesses from crimes and scams, and now we have a mobile app to expand the accessibility of official police alerts.\n\n\nOther features:\n- Share alerts on social media\n- Translate an alert into any language (if your main language isn't English).\n- Discover who your local police officers are, where your nearest police station is, and what the priorities are for your area.\n- Report a crime online or get in touch with the police in other ways.\n- Find out about Neighbourhood Watch and join your local scheme.\n\nIMPORTANT: After installing and opening the app, please allow it to ALWAYS use your location and to send you push notifications. Your location is used anonymously so you can receive local alerts. We do not collect any personal information and OWL, the police and councils do not store or have access to your location."

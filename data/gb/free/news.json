Застосунок не потребує реєстрації, не збирає персональні дані або дані про геолокацію.\n\nУ застосунку доступні всі області України, а також додано можливість отримувати тривоги лише за обраним районом чи територіальною громадою.\n\nЯк працює застосунок: \n\n1. Оператор обласної державної адміністрації отримує сигнал про повітряну тривогу.\n2. Оператор негайно передає інформацію на пульт.\n3. Застосунок надсилає тривожне сповіщення користувачам, які обрали відповідну область.\n4. Щойно оператор надсилає сигнал про відбій тривоги, користувачі застосунку отримують відповідне сповіщення.\n\nЦе єдиний застосунок, що підтримує критичні сповіщення. Це означає, що звук тривоги буде завжди надходити з максимальним рівнем гучності смартфону. Для цього надайте усі відповідні дозволи застосунку після встановлення. Важливо! Критичні сповіщення можна вимкнути в будь-який момент в налаштуваннях застосунку.\n\nБережіть себе та рідних. \n\n** Застосунок створено за підтримки Міністерства цифрової трансформації України.

      "label": "Watch any web video and your personal photos, videos & music on your Chromecast or Google Cast powered TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen. \n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> UPGRADE FEATURES (available as in-app purchases)\n\n* Premium Edition: Unlocks all of the features listed here. Also future features are included, so you do not have to pay for them when they are released in an updated app version. \n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker: Blocks ads & popups on most websites and removes the sponsoring ads from the app. You can update and enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!! And you designed it work easily and quickly\"\nRyan, England\n\n“I looooove your app. It has taken my Chromecast to a whole new level.”\nRosalind Romero, USA\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here.

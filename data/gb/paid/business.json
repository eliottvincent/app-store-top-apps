O rei James I da Inglaterra reuniu os maiores estudiosos religiosos e linguistas para uma nova tradução da Bíblia, a fim de estabelecer a tradução mais precisa e mais digna até à data. Ele nomeou 54 estudiosos para trabalhar na tradução, e 47 trabalharam em seis grupos em três locais por sete anos.\r\n\r\nApós a conclusão, a Bíblia King James foi impressa pela primeira vez em 1611 por Robert Barker. A Bíblia era muito grande, cerca de 40cm de altura. Por causa do alto custo e valor, foi anunciado para as igrejas que a Bíblia devia ser acorrentada nos púlpitos.\r\n\r\nA Bíblia 1611 foi autorizada para ser lida nas igrejas, razão pela qual foi chamada de Versão Autorizada. Enfim, nós da BV Books estamos felizes em poder apresentar, a Versão Autorizada em português da Bíblia King James."

Winmail Reader decodes \"winmail.dat\" file, and allows any attachments contained in them to be opened, read, saved or e-mailed.\n\n* * * Winmail Reader for Mac is also available on the Mac App Store. * * *\n\nWinmail.dat files are in fact TNEF format (Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format). Microsoft Outlook e-mail program for Windows send e-mails as TNEF. Most other e-mail programs, including Mail, do not understand TNEF.

The easy-to-use solution to circumvent this problem is provided by Winmail Reader.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n◆ Decodes \"winmail.dat\" files and list all attachments contained in it including email message.\n\n◆ Inbuilt quick-look preview to view attachments. Tap on attachment button to popup quick-look preview.\n\n◆ Allows attachments files to Copy to… another application, Save to Files, Copy, Print, share file to nearby iOS devices via AirDrop and more... Long press on attachment button to show share action options.\n\n◆ Resend entire decoded email as it is with message and extracted attachments.\n\n◆ Creates, edit and adds Microsoft Outlook Appointment and Meeting to iOS Calendar.

      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

I'm really happy with the stability and the ability to maintain a connection while working with content from other apps. No problems and only good experiences. Thanks for a solid app!\"\n\n\"Nice, clean app for transferring files and updating HTML and CSS. The editor is nice and easy to use, common symbols very quickly accessed. Support responded quickly and was very helpful at helping me set everything up right.\"\n\n\"I've been looking for a simple/complete file transfer app so that I can securely put and get files between my iPad and PC. I wish I had tried this before all of the other train wrecks! Great job on the app!!\"\n\n\"I was out of my office and needed to fix a PHP script for one of my clients, and that worked perfect for me. \nI totally recommend.\"\n\n\nYou can test the free Lite version of \"FTP Client Pro\" called \"FTP Client Lite\".\n\n\nIF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY PROBLEMS OR HAVE QUESTIONS/SUGGESTIONS PLEASE CONTACT: LessIsMoreDevelopment@gmail.com"

Simply input the information for the appliances Gas Rate size the meter length of pipe in the installation and how many bends will be used.\n\nThis will tell you if the installation will meet the requirement of a 1mb drop from the meter to the appliance. If not adjust the pipe sizes to get an instant answer to see if it works.\n\nOnly works for metric 35,32,28,22,15,12,10,8 mm pipes\nSteel pipes or imperial copper equivalent sizes could be used to give you a good idea, but will not be completely accurate.\n\nNo need to use calculations and tables to work out pipe sizes, it even tell you what size of gas meter should be fitted. This design tool completes all the hard stuff for you.\n\nPipe tables and pressure drops will only work upto 30m lengths of the chosen diameter. If you find that the pressure drop does not change when changing the diameter, then try a smaller pipe size it may work"

Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16. All column headers and labels in the Excel file are localized.\n17. Export/Import contacts to/from a VCF file.\n18. Backup contacts before import.\n19. Manage groups easily. You can now create, edit, delete groups and add contacts to groups.\n20. Export an Excel file with all photos included - this makes the contacts in your spreadsheet look better.\n21.

But they may not be searching effectively if they don’t know what jobs would best suit their personalities. That’s where MyTypeOfJob™ by PersonalityExpress™ can help.\n\nMyTypeOfJob™ is easy to use and provides practical, real, concrete suggestions for types of job and working environment that a person might enjoy - their ‘Preferences’. When a person looks at the overlap between these preferences and their ‘Competencies’ (what they are good at or qualified in*) then their career options become clearer.  \n\nHow does it work?  There are a few simple opinion-based questions (all answers are valid, there are no wrong answers) that give an indication of your preferences and personality.  Based on the outcomes you can browse ideas for the sorts of jobs that people with a similar personality and preferences to you typically enjoy. Not only that, you’ll get a description of useful “At Work” information for all the different Personality Types, for example:\n\nWhat might make them mad;  How they may annoy others\nWhat the best sort of working environment might be;  How they work best\nWhat they want from a boss;  What they offer as workmate\nTheir sense of humour;  How they may react under stress\n\nYou will see different viewpoints, and this may explain why you and a colleague may have different opinions.  There’s also a “Caricatures/Just for fun” section that takes a light-hearted view of what different types may be like as an employee.\n\nPersonalityExpress™ and its associated suite of Apps is designed to provide practical help in difficult situations. Disagreements and mistakes arise in the world mainly because people perceive the world (or a particular situation) in different ways, and prefer to make decisions in different ways.  An understanding of how or why other people's viewpoints and decision-making is not the same as our own can inform and modify our approach.  Personality Type - pioneered by psychologist Carl Jung - is one of the most popular and effective tools to assist. The PersonalityExpress™ suite of tools is a fast and easy way to understand Personality Type and to apply it to a range of practical situations.\n\nNo advertising and no additional purchase necessary, you receive full functionality. \n\nMyTypeOfJob™ by PersonalityExpress™. Seriously the best of its Type.\n\n\n*Note that this app does not look at qualifications or salaries required as this would be beyond the capabilities of an app. What the app does is help a person choose the sort of career they might find fulfilling."

      "label": "This application offers a unique approach to project management, which represents your project not just as a plan, but as a coordinated mechanism moving towards the goal. \n\nThe original technique allows you to break down project objectives into smaller goals, processes and resources, but not get lost in the details, but always see the overall structure of the project as a whole. After all, project management is not a mechanical observance of the plan, but the achievement of project goals, which should not be overlooked.\n\nThe application combines the classic project approach based on Gantt charts and project management through workflow diagrams. As a rule, Gantt charts are ideal for presenting project schedules, but they are not so convenient for reflecting the complex structure of the relationship between processes, goals and resources.\n\nMore formally, the program allows you to build a customized, based on the BPMN notation, PERT diagram of the project (with events and processes at nodes). Then this description of the project is used to generate a Gantt chart and track the progress of the project. \n\nSo, inShort is a powerful project and business process management tool, which can be applied not only in office but also for personal purposes. You can further explore the capabilities of the program with the detailed interactive User Guide.\n\nKey features of the application: \n• Building the diagram of processes and resources of the project (PERT network diagram of the project, based on BPMN notation). \n• The ability to drill down the elements of workflow diagrams. \n• Tracking the execution of the project. \n• Integration with the standard Calendar.\n• Displaying the list of project tasks in the form of a Gantt chart. \n• Separation of physical and information flows of the project. \n• Ability to specify the expected time of execution, both directly and parametrically. \n• Export of charts into PDF files and OPML outlines.\n• Project management according to the methodology of the Theory of Constraints. \n• Working calendars taking into account various schedules of work for implementation of tasks. \n• Work resources and their assignment to tasks. \n• Queues of tasks: organize the work with active tasks in accordance with the elements of the GTD methodology.\n• Checklists for diagrams — monitor the sequence of actions for project management step by step.\n\nAdvanced features of project management in accordance with the Theory of Constraints technique: \n• finding the critical path; \n• positioning of time buffers of the project; \n• calculation of buffer sizes; \n• calculation of late starts for feeding paths of the project; \n• tracking of time indicators during project execution. \n\n***\ninShort Pro — application version for experienced and advanced users, contains advanced and service functions useful for in-depth work with diagrams.\nFunctions included in inShort Pro:\n• Working with layers of diagrams;\n• inReview: publications of user diagrams surveys by experienced project managers, indicating successful findings and weaknesses in the diagrams. The procedure for sending diagrams for analysis is described in the Terms of Use.\n\nThe inShort Pro version is available by monthly subscription. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\ninShort Pro Subscription Terms of Use link: http://www.shortki.com/inShort/proTerms.html\n***\n\nCannot solve a problem? Draw it inShort and sort things out with it there. It's like voodoo but it works."

If not adjust the pipe sizes to get an instant answer to see if it works.\n\nOnly works for metric 35,32,28,22,15,12,10,8 mm pipes\nSteel pipes or imperial copper equivalent sizes could be used to give you a good idea, but will not be completely accurate.\n\nNo need to use calculations and tables to work out pipe sizes, it even tell you what size of gas meter should be fitted. This design tool completes all the hard stuff for you.\n\nPipe tables and pressure drops will only work upto 30m lengths of the chosen diameter. If you find that the pressure drop does not change when changing the diameter, then try a smaller pipe size it may work"

      "label": "A Bíblia King James de 1611 é descrita como uma das publicações mais importantes da história, e também a mais fiel ao Textus Receptus. O rei James I da Inglaterra reuniu os maiores estudiosos religiosos e linguistas para uma nova tradução da Bíblia, a fim de estabelecer a tradução mais precisa e mais digna até à data. Ele nomeou 54 estudiosos para trabalhar na tradução, e 47 trabalharam em seis grupos em três locais por sete anos.\r\n\r\nApós a conclusão, a Bíblia King James foi impressa pela primeira vez em 1611 por Robert Barker. A Bíblia era muito grande, cerca de 40cm de altura. Por causa do alto custo e valor, foi anunciado para as igrejas que a Bíblia devia ser acorrentada nos púlpitos.\r\n\r\nA Bíblia 1611 foi autorizada para ser lida nas igrejas, razão pela qual foi chamada de Versão Autorizada. Enfim, nós da BV Books estamos felizes em poder apresentar, a Versão Autorizada em português da Bíblia King James."

      "label": "This application offers a unique approach to project management, which represents your project not just as a plan, but as a coordinated mechanism moving towards the goal. \n\nThe original technique allows you to break down project objectives into smaller goals, processes and resources, but not get lost in the details, but always see the overall structure of the project as a whole. After all, project management is not a mechanical observance of the plan, but the achievement of project goals, which should not be overlooked.\n\nThe application combines the classic project approach based on Gantt charts and project management through workflow diagrams. As a rule, Gantt charts are ideal for presenting project schedules, but they are not so convenient for reflecting the complex structure of the relationship between processes, goals and resources.\n\nMore formally, the program allows you to build a customized, based on the BPMN notation, PERT diagram of the project (with events and processes at nodes). Then this description of the project is used to generate a Gantt chart and track the progress of the project. \n\nSo, inShort is a powerful project and business process management tool, which can be applied not only in office but also for personal purposes. You can further explore the capabilities of the program with the detailed interactive User Guide.\n\nKey features of the application: \n• Building the diagram of processes and resources of the project (PERT network diagram of the project, based on BPMN notation). \n• The ability to drill down the elements of workflow diagrams. \n• Tracking the execution of the project. \n• Integration with the standard Calendar.\n• Displaying the list of project tasks in the form of a Gantt chart. \n• Separation of physical and information flows of the project. \n• Ability to specify the expected time of execution, both directly and parametrically. \n• Export of charts into PDF files and OPML outlines.\n• Project management according to the methodology of the Theory of Constraints. \n• Working calendars taking into account various schedules of work for implementation of tasks. \n• Work resources and their assignment to tasks. \n• Queues of tasks: organize the work with active tasks in accordance with the elements of the GTD methodology.\n• Checklists for diagrams — monitor the sequence of actions for project management step by step.\n\nAdvanced features of project management in accordance with the Theory of Constraints technique: \n• finding the critical path; \n• positioning of time buffers of the project; \n• calculation of buffer sizes; \n• calculation of late starts for feeding paths of the project; \n• tracking of time indicators during project execution. \n\n***\ninShort Pro — application version for experienced and advanced users, contains advanced and service functions useful for in-depth work with diagrams.\nFunctions included in inShort Pro:\n• Working with layers of diagrams;\n• inReview: publications of user diagrams surveys by experienced project managers, indicating successful findings and weaknesses in the diagrams. The procedure for sending diagrams for analysis is described in the Terms of Use.\n\nThe inShort Pro version is available by monthly subscription. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\ninShort Pro Subscription Terms of Use link: http://www.shortki.com/inShort/proTerms.html\n***\n\nCannot solve a problem? Draw it inShort and sort things out with it there. It's like voodoo but it works."

      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

      "label": "This app offers four different calculations and shows the results both in a pane and on a psychrometric diagram:\r\n1. Air treatment\r\n   Calculates how to convert a given ambient air to a required design air. The steps involved are cooling with a given sensible heat factor, dehumidifying, heating and humidifying (adiabatic or steam). Depending on the given and required air conditions, some of these steps may not be needed.\r\n\r\n2. Capacities\r\n   Calculates the required capacity to cool down or heat up a given amount of air (e.g. air in your room).\r\n\r\n3. Heat exchanger\r\n   Calculates how warm room air heats up cool ambient air before supplying it as fresh air to the room. While heating up the ambient air, the heat exchanger cools down the room air, which may result in condensate. When the ambient air would be too cold, this calculation dimensions an electric heater to prevent condensate.\r\n\r\n4. Carburetor icing\r\n   Given a temperature and a dew point temperature, calculates the probability of icing in an airplane carburetor. Graphically shows the danger zones on a diagram.\r\n\r\nThese four calculations show the results in a pane, but also graphically in a diagram. You can choose between three different diagrams:\r\n1. Psychrometric\r\n   This is the classic diagram representing different kinds of air properties into a single diagram. You find detailed descriptions in standard books about air treatment, such as ASHRAE. This diagram shows lines of constant temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy and specific volume.\r\n\r\n2. Mollier\r\n   This is probably the oldest diagram to represent air properties and named after its inventor Richard Mollier (1863-1935). To get a psychrometrics diagram from a Mollier diagram, swap it along the vertical axis and rotate it 90°.\r\n   The Mollier diagram is heavily used in Eastern Europe and Germany and shows the same lines as in the psychrometrics diagram.\r\n\r\n3. Dewpoint\r\n   This diagram is meant for meteorologists and pilots. It is easy to read important weather data, such as temperature, dew point and relative humidity. However, this diagram shows the same constant lines as for the other two. Interestingly, the straight lines in the other two diagrams become curved lines in this one and vice versa.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n- Select two air properties to define a point: dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy, specific volume and moist air density.\r\n- No need for a keyboard. Enter data using buttons for small and large value increments.\r\n- Choose between metric or imperial unit dimensions, e.g. °C and °F or kW and BTU/h.\r\n- See immediate results of any change on the diagrams and the result panel shows detailed information about a point on the diagram.\r\n- Choose one of the diagram types (Psychrometrics, Mollier or Dewpoint) for the graphical results. Hide some constant lines on the selected diagram to simplify it. Define colors for the diagram lines and the background gradient.\r\n- Define the efficiency properties of a heat exchanger, giving you professional results.\r\n- Tap the explain tab to get a short explanation of a calculation or a diagram.\r\n- Zoom in (two fingers gesture) and pan (one finger gesture) to enlarge and move a part of the diagram.\r\n- The app saves your latest settings and starts up with those settings.\r\n- Supports five languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Dutch), which you can set in the preferences.\r\n- Supports light and dark themes."

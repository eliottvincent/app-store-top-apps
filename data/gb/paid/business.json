Then the search started. Which program is simple, clear and inexpensive. I found a lot, I did not like anything and that was too expensive and oversized. Ergo; we do something own.\n\nThe result in iNoRisk.org is now a detachment of the module \"Organization charts\" from the iNoRisk 4.0 App for Documentation in Occupational Health and Safety for the OSH organization. We found the functionality so beautiful that we decided to deploy it out of the way.\n\nWith a few clicks, you can build a structure and an organization tree and edit the fields by tapping. The \"+\" character adds new organization charts in the left column or additional text in the edit box. In addition, shapes and colors as well as the sizes can be adjusted. That's it.\n\nAnyway, we hope you enjoy the clicks and the easiest way to create an organizational chart that we can imagine. It's just easier - to let it be done ;-)"

      "label": "SECTION 2257 COMPLIANCE MADE EASY! \n\nThis productivity app is designed to allow producers of certain erotic-themed images or video to easily compile, store, and transmit model age and information records required by U.S. law. Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

Press power button, you can see signal strength bar moving, then slide the thumb to set the threshold (0.00~1.00), the value will be saved for next time use. \n\n2.If the indicator start flashing, that means a real recording start. check the recorded files,some test files can be found  there . \n\n3.In each scenario, the threshold value could be different, set it according to the situation. For example,for snoring and dream talk recording at night, set the value to 0.05, but at daytime, you probably have to set it at 0.10. \n\n4. Attention for naming a label: all files can be saved to your computer. Label,as a part of a file name, has to follow some rules for different computer OS.For this app, make it simple as follows,the name length is better to be limited to within 125 characters,as for the kind of characters, for Windows,you can't use ?\\|/ etc. in your label, otherwise iTunes will report a error such as no files found, just rename it as windows' requirement to fix it.\n\n\n**About Volume**\nSpeaker mode or earphone mode,  the speaker hardware is shared by all apps in your device, please check both modes and adjust the volume if you can't hear anything.\n\n**How to download recording files**\nFor file downloading,  iTunes File sharing Feature is recommended.  The basic steps : connect to iTunes->click \"iPhone\" ->click \"App\"->scroll down to find \"File sharing\"->click this app's icon -> select recording fils on the right box ->click \" Save\". You can also find more details in the help section of iTunes."

But it is not guess work. \n\nThe essential aspects of SEO can be addressed relatively predictably and mechanically if you understand how search engines work and appreciate that search engines are not some magical entity - search engines are rating a site based on what information is available to them on line. Simple.\n\nThe SEO-Keywords app aims to take care care of this mechanical predictable nature to unburden business owners, digital marketing managers and SEO practitioners, and save time and effort.\n\nOther tools are good (but expensive), but however quite often loose focus, can be clumsy, and are not easy to use or mobile first so just not handy for fitting SEO into busy business owner’s schedules. \n\n  * * * * *\n\nWhat is SEO?\n\nThere are two broad sources of digital information that help search engines to optimally find businesses against keywords and these can be optimised - this is SEO!\n\n1. Your Website \n\n2. Wider community Information (published articles, referrals, social media etc - these are all known as back-links)\n\nSEO-Keywords concentrates on the Website: Here information is grouped as “on-page” (what people can see), “off-page” (such as head meta tags) and technical “structured” (such as page load times, type of server, age of site, host quality, responsive, broken links ….).\n\n  * * * * *\n\nWhat are Keywords?\n\nYour campaigns, branding and aspirations define how you want others to see your business and hence what to be found for, particularly in a digital first approach. You are maybe striving to be known as the \"best car valet company in Milwaukee” - if so, your site needs to say this and keywords you want search engines to associate the website with in this instance maybe:\n\n- car valet Milwaukee\n\n- best car valet\n\nEtc …..\n\nSo firstly: you need to decide what your keywords and phrases are.\n\n   * * * * *\n\nHow does SEO-Keywords help?\n\nSEO-Keywords determines how often keywords appear and where: for example if they appear in your “Title\" meta-tags they they are deemed more important than in plain \"p\" paragraph text.\n\nIf you were to do this manually it would be quite error prone and take hours. Using the SEO-Keywords app it is repeatable, predictable and takes seconds.\n\nIf you want some advice , send me your URL and can show you how to use and how it can help!\n\n  * * * * *\n\nNotes:\n\n(1)  Please note Apple devices do not support downloading from unsecured, non-HTTPS enabled sites.

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

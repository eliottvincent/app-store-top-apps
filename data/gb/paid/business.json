Performers, photographers, website operators and others involved in the production of such material must generate legal records containing specific categories of information under Title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 & 2257A (“Section 2257”). A copy of the performer’s picture ID card must also be included in the records. Some online platforms also require a written record of consent by the performer to be depicted on a specific website or account.\n\nQuick 2257® allows you to:\n\n• Create a form containing the performer’s legal name, stage names, and/or aliases;\n• Record the date of original production of the depiction;\n• Identify the title of the work associated with the depiction;\n• Capture the performer’s picture ID card and verification photo on the mobile device; \n• Sign and verify the accuracy of the information using the touch screen;\n\n• Create a written, signed consent form authorizing publication of the depiction;\n\n• Compile all information into convenient .pdf forms; and,\n• Store the records on the device or email them to the records custodian.\n\nDeveloped by Lawrence G. Walters, Esq., First Amendment attorney and inventor of other technology designed for the online entertainment industry, this app streamlines the process of generating and transmitting Section 2257 records and consent forms. Anyone involved in the production of erotic material can now quickly compile, store, and transmit the mandatory performer records using this simple mobile app."

I used to carry a pricing sheet on a clipboard and tally up all the individual prices. I thought there has to be a better way. So I taught myself how to code. After hundreds of hours of coding and feedback from users of the first version of window counter, this is how the pro version came to be.

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

But the benefit is considerable. No longer tethered to your laptop, you can move around the room while still holding in your hand an image of what’s on the screen behind you. No more of that weird over-the-shoulder karaoke move when checking to see where you are in the presentation.\"\n\nGo to your next PowerPoint presentation IN STYLE with i-Clickr Remote for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch!\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Complete control of your PowerPoint presentation including animations.\n* Record your presentation (slides and your voice audio) into a movie as you present.\n* Share PDF version of the presentation with audience via E-Mail.\n* View your slides AND slide notes directly on your iOS device during your presentation.\n* Navigate through your slides with finger swipes and taps.\n* Grab your audience's attention with real-time annotations (Windows only).\n* Help you track your presentation time with onboard clock.\n* Set presentation alarm so that your iOS device will alert you with a silent buzz before your time runs out.\n* Pause and resume presentations.\n* Switch between multiple slideshow.\n* Work with both Windows and Mac Office (see below for the Office versions supported), iWork '09 Keynote on Mac, and OpenOffice on Windows.\n* Easy to set up with zero configuration.\n* No additional cost when using with multiple host computers.\n* NEW: Control presentation from your Apple Watch.\n* NEW: Control external laser pointer.\n\nRequirement:\n\n* On Windows, support all versions of Microsoft PowerPoint (the free Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer is not supported).  Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows (version XP or above) is required at the host PC. \n* On Mac OS X, Office Mac 2004 or above, or iWork '09 Keynote is required.\n* WiFi connection between the host computer and your device, or connection using direct ad hoc network and the iOS’s personal hotspot.  \n* Also support the FREE OpenOffice 3.1 on Windows.\n\nTo download software required at your host computer (that is, the PC/Mac that will run your PowerPoint presentation), visit http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/iClickr/Download.aspx\n\n*** If you have problem getting i-Clickr to work, please contact us at support@senstic.com, and we will help you fix the problem."

With the Rafter Tools-Plus app, you'll be able to calculate all of the complex angles for roof framing.\n\nThe calculator displays the hip rafter plumb line shift dimensions to precisely layout hip rafters for equal pitched or irregular hip roofs with any eave angle (0° - 180°). Calculate and layout the witches cut precisely with Rafter Tools-Plus (Square Tail Fascia) using the hip rafter plumb line shift dimensions.\n\nDisplay the hip rafter roof framing angles with easy to use Framing Square Usage. Calculates the lengths of common rafters, jack rafters, and hip rafters. With ridge and hip rafter width deductions. Use it to calculate Pentagonal, Hexagonal or Octagonal Roofs.\n\nTimber Framing Angles calculated from Bartok, Hawkindale, Martindale and McKibben-Gray Hip-Valley Roof Ratios Angle Formulas. Timber Framing Angles definition are just a click away in the app.\n\nStandard Rake Walls and Hip Rake Walls rotated into the roof surface plane.\nDevers-Canted Hip Rafters, Purlin Rafters\n\nRound Tower Framing, Octagonal Framing, Bay Window Framing"

This design tool completes all the hard stuff for you.\n\nPipe tables and pressure drops will only work upto 30m lengths of the chosen diameter. If you find that the pressure drop does not change when changing the diameter, then try a smaller pipe size it may work"

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

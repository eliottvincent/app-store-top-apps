      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "Over the past few years, the Scottish Curriculum underwent a major change. One of those changes was the introduction of the Curriculum for Excellence. This has normally been accessed through a Word or PDF document or through a folder located in the classroom. The Curriculum for Excellence App makes accessing the Curriculum for Excellence Experiences and Outcomes easier for Staff, parents and pupils directly on their devices.\n\nThe use of this App will allow those interested in accessing the Scottish 3-18 Curriculum with ease. Content has been assembled from the Education Scotland Website and once installed requires no access to the internet to be used.\n\nAs a Teacher myself, I found it difficult to access the information readily in a meeting or general discussion while in school or away at a training day. Either I had to lug about the Experiences and Outcomes folder all the time or be left without it at critical moments in meetings and discussions.\n\nEqually, while planning and trying to match up cross-curricular themes, the folder made the task more difficult due to the size of it. When a meeting was scheduled, Experiences and Outcomes were printed so everyone had a copy for the discussion. I set about creating something we could all access and use, while at the same time reducing unnecessary printing and additional costs.\n\nThe Curriculum for Excellence app will sit quietly in your phone and should you require to access an E and O at a point in a meeting, or check its relation during an in-service day or educational talk, then this will make it easier to stay focused on what is being discussed and not be thinking about where your folder is or what page you need to turn to.\n\nPlease come back and rate this app once you have used it. I know it seems so petty, but this helps other teachers, interested bodies, parents and pupils find it and use it. Even a small like will help out a great deal.\n\nI have tried my best to make the Curriculum for Excellence app as simple to access as possible and for it to be accessible to as many IOS devices I am able, knowing that technology is moving faster than we are able to purchase gadgets and tech. With that in mind, if you have a suggestion, concern or complaint, please get in touch and let me know so I can try to develop it, fix it or address it.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\n(The developer has no affiliation with Education Scotland.)"

Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 6 to 8. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher. \n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it).\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n• Improve your recognition of cadences, chords and modulations. \n• Learn to describe texture, structure, dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Cadences\n• Chords\n• Modulations\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again . The app also features supporting tools including a cadence trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Would you like to have all the scripts, language patterns and NLP techniques at your fingertips on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch?\n\nAre you looking at attending an NLP certification course and want to get ahead and master the scripts, content and understanding of NLP?\n\nWell, here is the best of the best…  from the NLP Practitioner and NLP Master Practitioner programs as presented and taught by The Tad James Co. With over 30 years of experience in teaching and using NLP techniques to empower and assist you to make positive changes.\n \nThis app is THE SAME HIGH QUALITY you have come to expect from the industry leaders – Dr. Tad James and Dr. Adriana James and over the last 30 years, many have purchased the printed cue cards version of this app.\n\nThe features include:\n• Full native iPad high resolution and Retina HD display on iPhone 4 support:\nEverybody knows all apps run on the iPad. However, many of them run in 1x native iPhone resolution – a small portion of the iPad screen only. Our app has been specifically designed to take full advantage of iPad’s higher resolution 1024 x 768 pixels and of the iPhone 4’s Retina HD display. Which translates in crisp and clear picture, whether you zoom in or out.\n\n• Zoom in or out:\nFor clarity or perhaps to see the bigger picture on  some pages, this feature has been implemented specifically for this app.\n\n• Favorites list or Bookmarks: \nHere you add put the pages you are going to use for an intervention or session so it’s all in one place. No flicking through pages and easy to find content.\n\n• Screen auto-rotate:\nNot all apps take full advantage of iOS 3.x and 4.x screen auto rotate feature. We made sure that, however you are looking at your iDevice’s screen, you will always find it easy to read in portrait or landscape. Whichever way you hold your iDevice, it will accommodate that.\n\n• Advanced search capabilities:\nSearch via key words for ANY word for quick easy access. The desired content is instantly displayed wherever it appears. You can then tap and view the desired topic.\n\n• Bonus content:\nIn addition to the NLP, you will also receive the latest scripts for Time Line Therapy® TECHNIQUES. THIS IS the most advanced AND easy to use modality to remove negative emotions and limiting decisions from your past so you can move freely in the future. \n\nWith over 80 scripts and outlines you can now easily follow the scripts and make all the techniques work in a business context, or education and general coaching.\n\nIn order to get the best results with this application, it is a good idea to attend a live training or an nlp internet training in the near future, or to have attended a Tad James Co. NLP training already. \n\nFor more info, please visit www.NLPcoaching.com, www.easyNLP.com or tap Visit us online at the bottom of the screen inside the app.\n\nIf you like this app and the content, please give us a 5 star review. This will allow us to reinvest the proceeds into developing other much needed NLP applications. Dr. Tad James’ vision over the last 30+ years is to empower people and deliver highest quality trainings and product. With your help, we can do this. Please email any suggestions, questions or bugs to bb@nlpcoaching.com and we will endeavor to incorporate them ASAP."

      "label": "This is the only app on the market that has both pronunciation training and business vocabulary training. This app contains all the lessons from the book Get Rid of your Accent for Business, by Linda James and Olga Smith. The book is available in print on Amazon, on Kindle, and as an audio book on Audible. \n\nThis is the most complete and comprehensive resource for business speech training. It's written in the style of the Financial Times and The Economist. It contains interviews with top professionals from Finance, IT, HR, Marketing and Law to help you practice up-to date business lingo. \n\nThis app is a short cut to achieving a high level of Business English. Our customers tell us that it immediately helps them to improve their performance at work. It is a must-have for all professionals who would like to succeed in this competitive world. \n\nThis app will help you to:\n\n• Neutralise your accent within 1-3 months\n• Make your Business English clear and easy to understand\n• Become a better communicator and public speaker\n• Increase your professional confidence and overall image\n• Improve your career prospects\n\nMany of our clients have been promoted as their speech became more educated and easy to understand. Here are some of the comments our clients have shared with us:\n\n“My boss told me: If I don’t lose my accent, I will lose my job.”\nGulnara, Financial Advisor, City of London\n\n“If I don’t speak clearly, I will just remain a junior IT guy making peanuts, who is staring at the computer all day and never even allowed to go to meetings.” \nYago, IT consultant, London\n\nVisit our website at www.batcsglobal.com to learn about our other accent apps and books.\n\n\nApp Contents and Functionality\n\nIn this speech training app, we teach you how to produce all British English sounds. Each lesson in the book covers one sound. \nFirst, we explain how to place your tongue, lips and jaw for the target sound. Then you repeat the sound in words, phrases, sentences, verses, tongue twisters and business prose passages. Additional lessons cover contractions, silent letters, and useful French expressions.\n\nThe lessons cover all English sounds needed to master Received Pronunciation, the neutral accent of educated English speakers. \nYou can play audio tracks, record yourself, and compare your pronunciation with the model.\n\n\nAbout the authors\n\nLinda James (RAM, Dip. Ed., IPD, LRAM)\n\nLinda trained at the Royal Academy of Music and qualified as a teacher of Speech and Drama. She also holds an International Phonetics Diploma from London University.\n\nLinda has had extensive experience as a dialect coach in TV, films and the theatre. For more than 20 years she has worked as a Speech Tutor at several London drama colleges and privately, specialising in the teaching of Received Pronunciation (RP) and the eradication of accents for professionals.\n\n\nOlga Smith (BA in Linguistics, MBA)\n\nOlga holds a degree in Linguistics and an MBA from Nottingham University. She is also an advanced public speaker and a holder of the Toastmaster bronze award.\n\nOlga learned a unique drama school method for Accent Reduction from top British phonetician Linda James. Together, they co-authored the bestselling “Get Rid of your Accent\" book series.\n\nIn the past, you could only get speech training in British drama schools or by taking speech lessons from a private speech tutor. Olga wanted to make this exclusive training accessible for a much wider audience. Linda and Olga took the method long used in London drama schools, adapted it for learners of English and collated it into a single training manual, the first of its kind.\n\nThe success of the book inspired Olga to design and launch Accent Reduction courses for those who need to neutralize their accent in a short period of time. The courses became a huge success and have been featured in National newspapers and television in the UK. Visit www.batcsglobal.com and book an individual course to get the best results in a short period of time."

      "label": "Speakin' Ilonggo is a language-learning app that focuses on sentence building. It contains over 2,300 Hiligaynon (aka Ilonggo) phrases with accompanying audio recorded by a native speaker from Negros Occidental, Philippines.\n\nMany of the phrases in Speakin' Ilonggo were adapted from the \"The Giant Ilonggo Phrasebook\" written by me, Paul Soderquist. I served as an LDS Missionary on Panay Island from 2010 to 2012 and tried to document everything I learned about the languages there. Though the original focus of the phrases was centered on missionary life, in developing this app many years later I've revised and reorganized the content in an effort to better help anyone who desires to learn Ilonggo.\n\nThe philosophy of Speakin' is that massive input is the true key to language learning, and that phrases (not vocabulary words) are the building blocks of conversation. Though I didn't originate the idea, I've come to agree with something called \"the 10,000 phrase method\". It basically says that if you feed your brain enough real sentences, enunciating and dissecting them word by word, phrase by phrase ensuring that you understand each one, then eventually after reaching the somewhat arbitrary and perhaps merely symbolic benchmark of 10,000, you will be fluent.\n\nThe app allows users to learn each sentence through trial and error. They are shown an English translation and tasked to build the corresponding Ilonggo phrase word by word. If they make a mistake, the phrase is automatically put in a \"repeat\" pile, and they will be given another chance sometime later to try again until they get it right.\n\nAt first, it may seem difficult to simply \"guess\" each word. Therefore, users can optionally long-press any of the multiple choice options in order to see its meaning without being penalized. Gradually, as the user continues to use the app they will become less dependent on this feature. That's an exciting experience.\n\nThere is also a review feature which allows users to see and hear all of the phrases they've completed in the \"done\" pile, as well as all of the individual words they've learned from a particular phrase set.\n\nFeel free to contact me personally for any questions or concerns.\n\npaulsoderquist3@gmail.com"

      "label": "Vegetation Ecologist Elizabeth Byers, the Flora of Nepal Project, the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (Nepal), and High Country Apps have partnered to produce the new WILDFLOWERS OF MOUNT EVEREST plant identification app for mobile devices.  The app presents over 550 wildflowers, shrubs, and trees likely to be seen along the trails in Sagarmatha National Park, Nepal.  More than 2500 beautifully detailed images illustrate the species descriptions, along with bloom period, elevation range, local names, and plant lore.  Most of the species can also be seen in the adjacent Makalu-Barun National Park and the upper elevations of the Gauri Shankar Conservation Area, and many are found throughout Nepal at higher elevations.  The app does not need an Internet connection to run, so you can use it no matter how remote your wanderings take you.\n\nThough primarily designed for amateur enthusiasts, the breadth of content also includes technical descriptions, scientific name synonymy, and references, making it appealing to more experienced botanists.  Users can browse the species list by plant name or plant family to locate a species and access the related information.  However, most users will want to rely on the easy-to-use search key to accurately identify plants of interest. Save your favorites to a personalized list and email it to yourself or your friends.\n\nThe key's interface is broken down into eleven simple categories: growth form (e.g., wildflower, shrub, vine), flower color, number of petals, flower type, elevation zone, habitat, leaf arrangement, leaf margin, leaf type, plant height, and flowering month.  Select choices in as many or as few categories as you wish.  As you do so, the number of species found is displayed at the top of the page.  Once done selecting, the click of a button returns a list of thumbnail images and names for potential matches.  Users scroll among the species on the list and tap a thumbnail image to access additional photos, descriptions, plant facts and lore.\n\nWILDFLOWERS OF MOUNT EVEREST includes supporting documents with information on the natural history of the Mount Everest region, descriptions of wildflower seasons and best times to visit, insights into how the climate influences the plant communities found here, a map of Sagarmatha National Park as well as detailed instructions on how to use the app.  Users will also find an extensive glossary of botanical terms, along with labeled diagrams of leaves, flowers, and inflorescences.  Finally, detailed descriptions can be found for each family contained in WILDFLOWERS OF MOUNT EVEREST.  Tapping on a family name brings up a list of images and names for all species in the app belonging to that family.\n\nSagarmatha National Park’s vegetation ranges from the temperate oak-hemlock forests at the lowest elevations, up through the fir-birch-rhododendron forests of the subalpine to the dwarf shrublands and meadows of the alpine, and on upward to scattered cushion plants at the highest elevations.  WILDFLOWERS OF MOUNT EVEREST will appeal to individuals of all ages who travel to such areas and are interested in knowing the names, natural history, and cultural importance of the plants that they encounter.  WILDFLOWERS OF MOUNT EVEREST is also a great educational tool for learning more about plant communities, botanical terms, and how to identify plants in general."

      "label": "The OFFICIAL ABRSM Aural Trainer contains interactive challenges to help develop your music aural skills (listening skills). Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 1 to 5. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher.\n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n\n• Improve your sense of pulse and metre (feeling the beat).\n\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it or spot differences and mistakes).\n\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n\n• Learn to describe dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Pulse and Metre\n• Echoes\n• Differences\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nTackle each element in stages using the preparation exercises.\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again. The app also features supporting tools including an interval trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

      "label": "A simple fun filled phonics app.\r\n\r\nThousands of schools use games from www.phonicsplay.co.uk in their daily phonics teaching. Now, some of that PhonicsPlay fun is available in an app. Alien brothers Obb and Bob guide children through an ongoing sequence of mini-games that rehearse key skills from Phase 2 of the Letters and Sounds programme that is used widely in UK schools.\r\n\r\nThe app is simple to navigate. Children can play independently and can continue playing as long as they like without the game coming to an end. Alternatively, for any parents feeling a bit bemused about phonics and how it is taught these days, this app is a great opportunity for playing and learning together.\r\n\r\nThis app is for children in the early stages of learning phonics and covers: s, a, t, p, i, n, m, d, g, o, c, k, ck, e, u, r, h, b, f, l.  \r\n\r\nThis app isn't designed to teach phonics - human beings will always do that job best. Instead it was designed to be a simple and enjoyable way for children to rehearse and build on what they have already learned.  As with any new skill, the more you rehearse it, the more automatic it becomes.  \r\n\r\nThere is no in-app purchasing in this game.\r\n\r\nFor further information or to find out more about how the app can support phonics learning, please visit: www.phonicsplayapps.co.uk\r\n2,"

A parent / teacher area lets you stay in touch with your children's progress and customize their learning experience.\n\n\"Finally - a just right app to help kids master math facts with serious motivation and tons of fun!\" - TeachersWithApps.com\n\n**************************************\n\nKey Features (from a child's perspective):\n\n- Practice your multiplication facts across 7 different game modes (Times Tables 1-12; Tricky Tables; Mix It Up; Fill in the Gap; Challenge Mode; Extreme Tables; Word Problems). \n- Covers multiplication tables from the regular 1 to 12 sets through to the 13s, 14s and 15s for those who want a further challenge.\n- Step by Step Training mode takes you through your multiplication tables one by one until you know them all.\n- 40 Squeebles characters to rescue by answering questions correctly, each with its own unique personality. \n- 50 gemstones to win for reaching certain milestones. \n- Earn turns on the fun mini-game, Bubble-Ball, by answering multiplication questions correctly. A second mini game is included in the Step by Step training mode as a \"Brain Break\" every so often.\n- Earn stars to swap for equipment to use in the Bubble-Ball game. \n- Win special random bonus rewards when you're least expecting it. \n\nKey Features (from a parent or teacher's perspective):\n\n- Password-protected parents/teacher zone lets you manage players and view progress. \n- View full stats from the last 28 days for each child. \n- Stats show each table attempted and any incorrect answers so each child's progress can be carefully monitored. \n- Register unlimited children with the app, making it perfect for classroom use as well as home use. \n- Lock multiplication sets or particular questions so children are only asked questions which are suitable for their ability level. This also stops children from earning unlimited rewards by answering questions they find very easy.\n- View a list of 'Tricky Multiplication Tables' for each child (questions they have previously got wrong).\n- Edit player settings, allowing customization for each child. \n- Switch between user-entry or multiple choice answer modes for children of different ages or ability levels. \n- No in-app purchases, adverts or internet links of any kind.\n\n**************************************\n\nThe app can be used by kids practicing for a weekly multiplication test, or those looking to improve multiplication and core math skills in general.\n\nFrom the App Store:\n\n\"Simply put: best multiplication app we’ve tried. The games require you to do math; tricky tables is a great way to work through mistakes; you can adjust settings for the math- and timer-anxious child. Really excellent design.\"\n\n\"My son liked saving/collecting the squeebles and reading their style/strengths the way he does Pokemon cards. And he learned all his times tables thru 12 in two sessions after struggling for weeks.\"\n\n\"I decided to purchase this for our 6 children to help them learn the times tables in a fun way.  It is a great app: they all enjoy it, it is easy to use, and best of all, they are learning their tables.\"\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for features, please e-mail info@keystagefun.co.uk"

This app is perfect for anyone wanting to have a little extra fun while role playing with their Reborn Baby dolls. While Babysitme is running a schedule, it tells the user to Feed, Burp, Rock and all other necessary actions when really taking care of an infant. These actions are designed to be acted out in role play with the user’s Reborn Baby Doll.\n\nWhen using the app you will be able to choose between Easy, Medium, Hard or Play mode simulations. The Easy, Medium & Hard simulations run on a 24-hour schedule. The Play mode is designed for people that are just wanting a fast-paced version of the app. It is a shortened version of the simulation modes where the care events are very close together and don’t last very long. \nRoutine is categorized in age groups designed to allow you to follow along with your babies routine, There are new care events and even tells you when baby is asleep or awake! \n\n- Name your baby. \n- Realistic 24-hour care schedule, Just like a real baby!\n- Easy for all ages to use (Recommended ages 7+). \n- Bond with your Reborn baby through your baby needing your care and attention.\n- Play schedules for younger children with a shorter attention span. \n- You wont know when your baby will cry for the next care event, making it as realistic as a real baby. \n- Unpredictable care events meaning it isn’t the same old boring Routine every day.\n\n\nThe idea of the app is you place your device next to your Baby Doll and wait for the app to send through a notification sound (cries).  You will need to check the device for what the baby would like, then give the baby doll the correct care\nFor example:\n- Feed baby \n- Burp baby \n- Nappy change \n- Rock baby\n- cuddle baby\n    (Etc…)\n\nWhen the babies care is finished the App will sound again letting you know the care event is finished. Place the device back next to baby and wait for the device to make another sound for the next care event.\nWhen you are finished you simply turn the app off.\n\nThis app has been designed for fun, as a form of entertainment."

      "label": "Get Rid of your Accent is a phenomenon. Seven years ago, we created an instant hit, the best-selling pronunciation book in the UK. Our second and third books make us the most popular books and CD package around. Actors, lawyers, brokers, businessmen, and diplomats have flourished with our help. \n\n\"As a diplomat I need effective communication skills, particularly to address public audiences through radio and TV. A clear, crisp accent is always more convincing than a thick, foreign one. I am reading this book and I think it is immensely useful for foreigners like myself.\"  Samuel Moncada, Venezuelan Ambassador to the UK\n\n\n\"Clearly, the authors of the book have collected years of experience and expertise to create this practical and effective tool for speech study.\"  Joe Windley, Head of Speech, Central School of Speech and Drama, London\n\nNow with this toolkit you can get the best of our amazing lessons in one easy-to-use app that goes everywhere with you, it is  the British English Pronunciation Course at your fingertips. Hear the sounds; see how to make them; practice; and watch your career, education, and social life blossom.\nVisit www.batcsglobal.com  \n\nApp Contents and Functionality\n\nThe lessons cover all English sounds needed to master Received Pronunciation, neutral accent of educated southern English and the chief accent taught to foreigners who wish to learn the British model. Students can play audio tracks, record themselves, and compare their pronunciation with the model.\n\nThis app will help you to:\n\n• Neutralise your accent within 1-3 months\n• Make your English clear and easy to understand\n• Become a better communicator and public speaker\n• Increase your personal confidence and overall image\n• Improve your job prospects\n\n\nAbout the authors\n\nLinda James (RAM, Dip. Ed., IPD, LRAM)\n\nLinda trained at the Royal Academy of Music and qualified as a teacher of Speech and Drama. She also holds an International Phonetics Diploma from London University.\n\nLinda has had extensive experience as a dialect coach in TV, films and the theatre. For more than 20 years she has worked as a Speech Tutor at several London drama colleges and privately, specialising in the teaching of Received Pronunciation (RP) and the eradication of accents.\n\n\nOlga Smith (BA in Linguistics, MBA)\n\nOlga holds a degree in Linguistics and an MBA from Nottingham University. She is also an advanced public speaker and a holder of the Toastmaster bronze reward.\n\nOlga learned a unique drama school method for Accent Reduction from top British phonetician Linda James. They together co-authored the UK bestselling books, “Get Rid of your Accent”, Part One, Part Two and Part Three.\n\nIn the past, you could only get speech training in British drama schools or by taking speech lessons from a private speech tutor. Olga wanted to make this exclusive training accessible for a much wider audience. Linda and Olga took the method long used in London drama schools, adapted it for learners of English and collated it into a single training manual, with CDs, the first of its kind.\n\nThe success of the book led to another venture Olga undertook: she designed and launched Accent Reduction courses for diplomats, professionals, students, and many others who need to neutralize their accent in a short period of time. The courses became a huge success and have been featured in National newspapers and television in the UK. Visit www.batcs.co.uk and book an individual course to get the best results in a short period of time."

With lots of cozy spaces, an aquarium and outdoor space, every pet will find a nice spot to play or relax — dog or cat, bird or sloth-bat!\n\nVETERINARY: The vet can help sick pets feel better and help healthy pets stay that way! You’ll find pills, drops and the instruments needed to operate on sick or injured pets. Pets can play outdoors or wait on the cozy beds until the vet is ready to see them.\n\nPET SHOP: Find everything you need for to groom, feed, play with and care for your pets at the pet shop. After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice and your characters’ movements as you’re telling the story. Create videos up to two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share your storytelling later! \n\nAbout Us:\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Each question will require one correct answer to be picked from a choice of four.\r\n\r\nThe assessment will be made up from questions covering eleven topics. The numbers of questions that will be used from each topic are:\r\n - General Health and Safety at Work - 6\r\n - Manual Handling Operations - 4\r\n - Reporting Accidents - 3\r\n - Personal Protective Equipment at Work - 4\r\n - Health and Hygiene - 3\r\n - Fire and Emergency - 9\r\n - Work at Height - 5\r\n - Work Equipment - 4\r\n - Special Site Hazards - 3\r\n - Electrotechnical - 6\r\n - Environmental - 3\r\n \r\nTo successfully pass an assessment, 43 out of the 50 questions must be answered correctly.\r\n\r\nIf the delegate is unsuccessful they may take a new assessment. A fee is chargeable by the assessment organisation for each assessment taken by the delegate.\r\n\r\nPreparation\r\n\r\nThis guide should be used to help prepare for the assessment.\r\n\r\nThe guide contains all the questions that can be used to make up the awareness assessment, together with the correct answer and, where applicable, a brief explanation of the answer.\r\n\r\nThe assessment uses a selection of the questions from the question bank printed in this guide, however, the four answers in the assessment may be in a different order from the order shown in this guide.\r\n\r\nThere are no questions in the assessment that are not in this guide. The assessment is designed to test basic knowledge and awareness of health and safety for people working in the electrical industry and on construction sites. The awareness assessment is not trying to trip up or catch people out, all the questions in the assessment are listed in this guide.\r\n\r\nThe ECS Revision may be used as the end of course test for health and safety training but in no way should not be considered a qualification in Health and Safety."

      "label": "Designed by an Occupational Therapist.\nFirst & Then is a very simple app that uses a board with photos to show that one activity must happen before the next can occur. A fantastic tool for visual learners! \n\nThe idea behind a First & Then board is to encourage a child to complete an activity that they don’t particularly enjoy. The board motivates the child to engage in a less preferred activity, knowing that a preferred activity (or a reward) will follow. For example, the ‘first’ activity may be something such as handwriting, homework, eating vegetables, using the toilet or visiting the dentist. The ‘then’ activity may be playing outside, computer time or a chocolate treat. \n\nThe App is extremely simple to use, the board is set up from one page, with clear prompts to help along the way. \n\nThe app allows the user to quickly and simply insert photos from the device’s camera or photo library, meaning that ‘First & Then’ boards can be made on-the-go and with little fuss.  Photos taken are saved within the App to use again and again.\n\nThe app includes a coloured visual timer, that the user can choose to use, to show the child how long they need to spend on an activity. As well as a digital display, the time is also represented by a coloured pie chart. When the pie is green, the child needs to keep going. When the pie turns amber, the child needs to get ready to finish. The pie turns red when it is time to stop the activity.\n\nThe app also includes a ‘Finished box’. The child can drag the photo into this box when the activity is completed. \n\nThe App is complete with the option to use exciting tones to reward the child for completing the activity."

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

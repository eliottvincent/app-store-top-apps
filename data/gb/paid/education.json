      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

      "label": "Spelling Bee by Squeebles is an app aimed at helping 5 to 11 year old kids practice their spellings in a fun, motivating environment. It allows you to set up your own, personalized spelling tests, as well as download from over 150 pre-recorded tests containing over 1800 words.\n\n\"After evaluating many spelling apps, I was so pleasantly surprised while testing out Squeebles Spelling – it’s a winner!\" - TeachersWithApps.com\n\n**************************************\n\nKey Features (from a parent or teacher's perspective):\n\n- Set up your own custom spelling tests containing the exact words your kids need to learn, recording yourself speaking the audio of each word, or download from over 200 pre-recorded spelling tests created by us across 5 difficulty levels.\n\n- Dyslexia-friendly features, including the option of using Open Dyslexic font.\n\n- Accented characters allow you to set up spelling tests for French, Spanish, German or Italian words.\n\n- Individual statistics cover spelling test scores and show incorrect spellings so you can see what each child is struggling with.\n\n- Print each child's previous tests and answers.\n\n- Register unlimited children on any one device\n\n- Share spelling tests between devices or back them up to the cloud using a free KeyStageFun account.\n\n- Customize each child's experience with personalized settings.\n\n- No in-app purchases, no adverts and no internet links for children to accidentally tap on.\n\n- Parent / teacher area can be password protected.\n\n- A motivational reward system for your children keeps them practicing their spellings so they can keep earning further rewards and making progress in the game.\n\n**************************************\n\nKey Features (from a child's perspective):\n\n- Practice your spellings across 4 different game modes, taking personalized tests set by a parent or teacher, KeyStageFun downloadable tests, random tests and tricky tests.\n\n- \"Tricky Words\" mode only asks you questions you previously answered incorrectly.\n\n- Consolidate learning by taking one-off tests that choose words randomly from all the words stored in the app.\n\n- Rescue 20 Squeebles from the clutches of the nasty Spelling Snake, including some designed by children who won our \"Design a Squeeble\" competition. Each Squeeble has its own unique personality, facts and stats.\n\n- Every time you spell a word correctly, you earn turns on the fun \"Squeeberang\" mini game, where Squeebles fly as far as they can through the air on boomerang-shaped colourful flying machines.\n\n- Collect stars to trade for Squeeberangs and power-ups to use in the Squeeberang game. The more stars you have, the better the Squeeberangs you can get.\n\n- Earn power-ups to use in the game.\n\n- View high scores, stats and the rewards you've won.\n\n**************************************\n\nThe app can be used by kids practicing for a weekly spelling test or spelling bee, or those looking to improve vocabulary ahead of school end of year tests.\n\nFrom the App Store:\n\n\"Love this design!  Simple, easy to use, interactive.  I have downloaded eight different spelling apps - all four stars +.  However, this is the best one I have found for my son.\" (5 star review)\n\n\"We use this app to help my daughter study for her weekly spelling test. It is a great study tool. She gets 100% on almost all of her tests.\"\n\n\"My husband and I enjoyed recording our daughter's weekly spelling words (using silly voices, of course!). My nine year old was giggling as she learned - who knew spelling could be so fun?\"\n\n\"My daughter practices her spelling list on this every night. It works great, easy to use and set up. She loves earning points to buy squeeberangs. Way more fun than practicing on paper, and helps them find their way around the keyboard too.\"\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for features, please e-mail info@keystagefun.co.uk"

Say the word in the conjugated form indicated.\n(2) Tap the sound icon to check whether you said the conjugated form correctly.\n(3) Tap the ＊ icon to check the conjugated form in writing.\n(4) Study the use of the conjugated form by referring to the example sentence and illustration on the back side of the card.\n(5) Tap the Rule icon to see the conjugation rule.\n\nCheck: Test your retention of each conjugated form by typing in your answers.*\n(1) Type in the conjugated form as instructed.\n(2) If you entered the correct form, the card will be removed from MyDeck. Cards answered incorrectly or skipped will remain in the deck for further practice.\n*To study with the Check method, you will need to add a Japanese keyboard to your iPhone settings before starting.\n\nHandy features\n•Menu\nThe study selections are grouped together in a single menu to allow you to practice more efficiently. \n\n•List\nAll conjugation forms of each word are listed in this feature, with the words arranged in a-i-u-e-o order. A check mark is displayed next to each conjugation form that has been mastered and the MyDeck card for each entry can be opened, allowing you to review the conjugations via the list.\n\n•Rule\nThis feature lists the rules for all 28 conjugation types covered by the app, enabling you to quickly look up the way to form conjugations such as the passive, the causative, the causative passive, and the tricky te-form.\n\n•MyDeck Shuffle Mode\nActivating this mode will cause the app to display the MyDeck cards in random order, rather than the default order. Shuffling the deck will help you to more firmly master the material.\n\n•Tutorials\nThe tutorials provide helpful lessons on how to add a Japanese keyboard and operate each function. \n\n—This app is based on the second edition of GENKI.\n—Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

Try this app!\n\n1. SOLVE REAL RUBIK'S CUBE\n    Place the Rubik's Cube in front of the camera, follow the prompts to scan the 6 Rubik's facets in turn, and then this app will show you the steps to solve the Rubik's Cube in 3D step by step!\n    Note: Automatic recognition of the Rubik's Cube needs to be done in a well-lit place, dim lighting environment will lead to recognition failure.\n    Tips: If the cube is not recognized when you scan it, you can rotate a random face of the cube and try scanning again.\n\n\n2. PLAY VIRTUAL RUBIK'S CUBE\n    Playing Rubik's Cube on iPhone feels playing a real one!\n    KEY FEATURES:\n    - Realistic 3D graphics makes you feel playing with real Rubik's Cube.\n    - Swipe the cube with your finger to rotate the layer of cube. Swipe through the blank area to rotate the cube.\n    - You can also tap the Undo button to undo the last action.\n    - Double-tap on the face of the cube to mark the face; double-tap again to remove it. After the face marked, subsequent rotations will generate guide lines to show the rotation action.\n    - Tilt the phone horizontally or vertically to change the viewing angle of the Rubik's Cube.\n    - Rubik's Cubes of 2, 3, 4 and 5- order included.\n   \nSuggestions or questions?

      "label": "\"Laminitis\" the iPhone App was created to provide horse owners with a practical tool to help monitor weather conditions in a way that can be used to warn when grazing on grass posses an increased risk to horses prone to laminitis.\n\nLocal weather conditions are monitored and are used to predict the rise and fall of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC's) in grass.  When the predicted NSC's increase, this is shown as a rise in risk.\n\nUnder extreme weather conditions grass can become stressed and in these circumstances significantly increase the risk of a horse becoming footy or suffering a laminitic episode.  When this type of weather pattern happens the risk gauge will rapidly increase to High and maintain this level until the NSC and grass stress levels are predicted to have lowered again.\n\nToday, laminitis is a huge problem for horses all over the world and is one of the most common causes of lameness.  With the help of this app as an educational tool it is hoped that fewer horses will suffer from this condition going forward.\n\nCurrent Coverage: United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland), Ireland, France, Belgium\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application is not intended as a replacement for correct animal husbandry or to replace veterinary advice, it's role is simply to act as an additional early warning tool to advise when grasses at the location you have selected are likely to be 'under stress' and therefore to have accumulated excess non-structural carbohydrates (NSC, i.e. sugars, starch or fructan) which could significantly increase the risk of a laminitic episode should it be grazed.\n\nThis app can give you a warning when the risk of grazing induced laminitis is rising or high. However, individual horses vary widely in their ability to tolerate fluctuations in NSC levels so what is safe for one horse may not be safe for another. In addition, grazing is only one risk factor for laminitis and you need also to be aware of the risks posed by other causes, including toxins, metabolic problems and sugar and starch levels in hard feed, which cannot be measured by this app."

      "label": "The OFFICIAL ABRSM Aural Trainer contains interactive challenges to help develop your music aural skills (listening skills). Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 6 to 8. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher. \n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it).\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n• Improve your recognition of cadences, chords and modulations. \n• Learn to describe texture, structure, dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Cadences\n• Chords\n• Modulations\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again . The app also features supporting tools including a cadence trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

This app is perfect for anyone wanting to have a little extra fun while role playing with their Reborn Baby dolls. While Babysitme is running a schedule, it tells the user to Feed, Burp, Rock and all other necessary actions when really taking care of an infant. These actions are designed to be acted out in role play with the user’s Reborn Baby Doll.\n\nWhen using the app you will be able to choose between Easy, Medium, Hard or Play mode simulations. The Easy, Medium & Hard simulations run on a 24-hour schedule. The Play mode is designed for people that are just wanting a fast-paced version of the app. It is a shortened version of the simulation modes where the care events are very close together and don’t last very long. \nRoutine is categorized in age groups designed to allow you to follow along with your babies routine, There are new care events and even tells you when baby is asleep or awake! \n\n- Name your baby. \n- Realistic 24-hour care schedule, Just like a real baby!\n- Easy for all ages to use (Recommended ages 7+). \n- Bond with your Reborn baby through your baby needing your care and attention.\n- Play schedules for younger children with a shorter attention span. \n- You wont know when your baby will cry for the next care event, making it as realistic as a real baby. \n- Unpredictable care events meaning it isn’t the same old boring Routine every day.\n\n\nThe idea of the app is you place your device next to your Baby Doll and wait for the app to send through a notification sound (cries).  You will need to check the device for what the baby would like, then give the baby doll the correct care\nFor example:\n- Feed baby \n- Burp baby \n- Nappy change \n- Rock baby\n- cuddle baby\n    (Etc…)\n\nWhen the babies care is finished the App will sound again letting you know the care event is finished. Place the device back next to baby and wait for the device to make another sound for the next care event.\nWhen you are finished you simply turn the app off.\n\nThis app has been designed for fun, as a form of entertainment."

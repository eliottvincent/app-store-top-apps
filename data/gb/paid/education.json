      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "Over the past few years, the Scottish Curriculum underwent a major change. One of those changes was the introduction of the Curriculum for Excellence. This has normally been accessed through a Word or PDF document or through a folder located in the classroom. The Curriculum for Excellence App makes accessing the Curriculum for Excellence Experiences and Outcomes easier for Staff, parents and pupils directly on their devices.\n\nThe use of this App will allow those interested in accessing the Scottish 3-18 Curriculum with ease. Content has been assembled from the Education Scotland Website and once installed requires no access to the internet to be used.\n\nAs a Teacher myself, I found it difficult to access the information readily in a meeting or general discussion while in school or away at a training day. Either I had to lug about the Experiences and Outcomes folder all the time or be left without it at critical moments in meetings and discussions.\n\nEqually, while planning and trying to match up cross-curricular themes, the folder made the task more difficult due to the size of it. When a meeting was scheduled, Experiences and Outcomes were printed so everyone had a copy for the discussion. I set about creating something we could all access and use, while at the same time reducing unnecessary printing and additional costs.\n\nThe Curriculum for Excellence app will sit quietly in your phone and should you require to access an E and O at a point in a meeting, or check its relation during an in-service day or educational talk, then this will make it easier to stay focused on what is being discussed and not be thinking about where your folder is or what page you need to turn to.\n\nPlease come back and rate this app once you have used it. I know it seems so petty, but this helps other teachers, interested bodies, parents and pupils find it and use it. Even a small like will help out a great deal.\n\nI have tried my best to make the Curriculum for Excellence app as simple to access as possible and for it to be accessible to as many IOS devices I am able, knowing that technology is moving faster than we are able to purchase gadgets and tech. With that in mind, if you have a suggestion, concern or complaint, please get in touch and let me know so I can try to develop it, fix it or address it.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\n(The developer has no affiliation with Education Scotland.)"

      "label": "From the charity behind the award-winning Teach Your Monster To Read comes Teach Your Monster: Adventurous Eating, a brand new learning game that helps kids get excited about fruit and vegetables.  \n \nAdventurous Eating is a game for kids developed with child feeding specialist Dr Lucy Cooke inspired by The SAPERE method. This scientific learning technique encourages children to learn new things about food using all five senses; sight, touch, smell, hearing and taste.\n \nWhy Adventurous Eating?\n\nThis game is packed full of fun mini-games that encourage 3 to 6 year olds to explore foods with all five of their senses and help build a better relationship with food. We know that children respond well to feeding or caring for a character, so the game encourages kids to try fruit and veg by using all of their senses, as research shows this is an effective way of making new food less intimidating.\n \nHow does Adventurous Eating work?\n\nThe game starts with your child making their monster who goes to Bub’s Food Party at Tasty Towers. Guided by Bub, they play a fun mini-game at each of the five tables at the party, one for each sense. Watch their monster explore over 40 different fruit and vegetables with all five senses and see the ‘wow moment’ as they start to see food in a new way! Just like in real life, different monsters like different foods, so the monsters won't always like the food they try, and that's OK—next time, they might.\n\nThe idea of the game is to become an adventurous eater by earning stars every time their monster uses one of their senses with a new fruit or vegetable. These stars give the monster access to the exclusive disco party, where they will hear a unique, catchy song for every fruit and vegetable they try. After the disco, the party ends, and everyone goes home with a sticker for their sticker book showing the food they’ve explored that day. Monsters can collect a sticker for each food they’ve tried and customise it with a silly face and body parts to make it even more fun. Then it’s off to bed, where the monster dreams about what food they have tried that day! \n\nHow can Adventurous Eating help my child?\n\nThe early results of the game are impressive, having been played over 1.3 million times by 350,000 children worldwide. After playing the game, the children try new fruits and vegetables and ask when they can play again to ensure their monster goes to the disco party! In addition, over half of the parents said their children would have a healthier relationship with food after playing Teach Your Monster: Adventurous Eating. So why not start your little one on their food adventure too? \n\n \nAbout Us\n \nWe are Teach Your Monster - a non-profit that creates magical, fun-filled learning games for kids. \n\nWith the help of friendly monsters, playful design, and magnificent storytelling, we work with leading academics to create beautifully crafted games kids love to play. Trusted by teachers, parents, and home educators, our innovative products aim to engage even the most reluctant learners.\n \nTeach Your Monster works with The Usborne Foundation — a charity set up by Peter Usborne CBE of Usborne Publishing, to support early years learning. We believe every child should have the opportunity to reach their full potential in their early years and beyond.\n\nFollow us on social media for the latest news:\nFacebook:  @TeachYourMonster\nInstagram: @teachyourmonster\nYouTube:  @teachyourmonster\nTwitter:  @teachmonsters\n\nWhat food shall we try today?\n\n© Teach Your Monster Limited, 2022"

      "label": "The Baby Sensory Signbook app teaches you all signs you need, so you and your baby can start communication and language development. Learn to communicate long before the development of speech, using our simple Babysigns.\n\n\nFEATURES \n- All official Baby Sensory baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favourites, for the signs you're learning.\n- Learn 'Say Hello' and 4 other songs' signs with music.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Baby Sensory app, you can easily learn all official signs to make early communication possible. This creates a stronger parent-child bond and stimulates early language development.\nEven the youngest baby wants to tell you what they need and how they feel. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally and may cry if their needs are not met. Signing helps your baby to express his or her needs and takes the guesswork out of parenting.\n\n\nABOUT US\nBaby Sensory was the first baby programme to offer a complete approach to learning and development from birth to 13 months. Designed to stimulate, educate and provide precious memories during the all-important first years of life, the programme has won multiple awards both nationally and internationally since 2008. Everything we do is backed by over 35 years of expert research in childhood development. \n\n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the app, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.babysensory.com for more info.\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.babysensory.com\nMail: apps@babysensory.com\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: apps@babysensory.com\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/BabySensoryUK\nwww.twitter.com/BabySensoryHQ"

It allows you to set up your own, personalized spelling tests, as well as download from over 150 pre-recorded tests containing over 1800 words.\n\n\"After evaluating many spelling apps, I was so pleasantly surprised while testing out Squeebles Spelling – it’s a winner!\" - TeachersWithApps.com\n\n**************************************\n\nKey Features (from a parent or teacher's perspective):\n\n- Set up your own custom spelling tests containing the exact words your kids need to learn, recording yourself speaking the audio of each word, or download from over 200 pre-recorded spelling tests created by us across 5 difficulty levels.\n\n- Dyslexia-friendly features, including the option of using Open Dyslexic font.\n\n- Accented characters allow you to set up spelling tests for French, Spanish, German or Italian words.\n\n- Individual statistics cover spelling test scores and show incorrect spellings so you can see what each child is struggling with.\n\n- Print each child's previous tests and answers.\n\n- Register unlimited children on any one device\n\n- Share spelling tests between devices or back them up to the cloud using a free KeyStageFun account.\n\n- Customize each child's experience with personalized settings.\n\n- No in-app purchases, no adverts and no internet links for children to accidentally tap on.\n\n- Parent / teacher area can be password protected.\n\n- A motivational reward system for your children keeps them practicing their spellings so they can keep earning further rewards and making progress in the game.\n\n**************************************\n\nKey Features (from a child's perspective):\n\n- Practice your spellings across 4 different game modes, taking personalized tests set by a parent or teacher, KeyStageFun downloadable tests, random tests and tricky tests.\n\n- \"Tricky Words\" mode only asks you questions you previously answered incorrectly.\n\n- Consolidate learning by taking one-off tests that choose words randomly from all the words stored in the app.\n\n- Rescue 20 Squeebles from the clutches of the nasty Spelling Snake, including some designed by children who won our \"Design a Squeeble\" competition.

The more stars you have, the better the Squeeberangs you can get.\n\n- Earn power-ups to use in the game.\n\n- View high scores, stats and the rewards you've won.\n\n**************************************\n\nThe app can be used by kids practicing for a weekly spelling test or spelling bee, or those looking to improve vocabulary ahead of school end of year tests.\n\nFrom the App Store:\n\n\"Love this design!  Simple, easy to use, interactive.  I have downloaded eight different spelling apps - all four stars +.  However, this is the best one I have found for my son.\" (5 star review)\n\n\"We use this app to help my daughter study for her weekly spelling test. It is a great study tool. She gets 100% on almost all of her tests.\"\n\n\"My husband and I enjoyed recording our daughter's weekly spelling words (using silly voices, of course!). My nine year old was giggling as she learned - who knew spelling could be so fun?\"\n\n\"My daughter practices her spelling list on this every night. It works great, easy to use and set up. She loves earning points to buy squeeberangs. Way more fun than practicing on paper, and helps them find their way around the keyboard too.\"\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for features, please e-mail info@keystagefun.co.uk"

Make sure you check out the preview screenshots in the App Store to see how the app will look on your device."

      "label": "The OFFICIAL ABRSM Aural Trainer contains interactive challenges to help develop your music aural skills (listening skills). Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 1 to 5. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher.\n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n\n• Improve your sense of pulse and metre (feeling the beat).\n\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it or spot differences and mistakes).\n\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n\n• Learn to describe dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Pulse and Metre\n• Echoes\n• Differences\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nTackle each element in stages using the preparation exercises.\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again. The app also features supporting tools including an interval trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

      "label": "The OFFICIAL ABRSM Aural Trainer contains interactive challenges to help develop your music aural skills (listening skills). Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 6 to 8. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher. \n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it).\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n• Improve your recognition of cadences, chords and modulations. \n• Learn to describe texture, structure, dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Cadences\n• Chords\n• Modulations\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again . The app also features supporting tools including a cadence trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

      "label": "Squeebles Multiplication is a fun, interactive way for your children to learn and practice their multiplication tables and improve their basic math skills. \n\nThe app features seven different game modes and a training area that teaches as well as tests, along with a reward system that appeals to children where they rescue Squeebles characters from the nasty Math Monster and earn turns on a fun mini game. A parent / teacher area lets you stay in touch with your children's progress and customize their learning experience.\n\n\"Finally - a just right app to help kids master math facts with serious motivation and tons of fun!\" - TeachersWithApps.com\n\n**************************************\n\nKey Features (from a child's perspective):\n\n- Practice your multiplication facts across 7 different game modes (Times Tables 1-12; Tricky Tables; Mix It Up; Fill in the Gap; Challenge Mode; Extreme Tables; Word Problems). \n- Covers multiplication tables from the regular 1 to 12 sets through to the 13s, 14s and 15s for those who want a further challenge.\n- Step by Step Training mode takes you through your multiplication tables one by one until you know them all.\n- 40 Squeebles characters to rescue by answering questions correctly, each with its own unique personality. \n- 50 gemstones to win for reaching certain milestones. \n- Earn turns on the fun mini-game, Bubble-Ball, by answering multiplication questions correctly. A second mini game is included in the Step by Step training mode as a \"Brain Break\" every so often.\n- Earn stars to swap for equipment to use in the Bubble-Ball game. \n- Win special random bonus rewards when you're least expecting it. \n\nKey Features (from a parent or teacher's perspective):\n\n- Password-protected parents/teacher zone lets you manage players and view progress. \n- View full stats from the last 28 days for each child. \n- Stats show each table attempted and any incorrect answers so each child's progress can be carefully monitored. \n- Register unlimited children with the app, making it perfect for classroom use as well as home use. \n- Lock multiplication sets or particular questions so children are only asked questions which are suitable for their ability level. This also stops children from earning unlimited rewards by answering questions they find very easy.\n- View a list of 'Tricky Multiplication Tables' for each child (questions they have previously got wrong).\n- Edit player settings, allowing customization for each child. \n- Switch between user-entry or multiple choice answer modes for children of different ages or ability levels. \n- No in-app purchases, adverts or internet links of any kind.\n\n**************************************\n\nThe app can be used by kids practicing for a weekly multiplication test, or those looking to improve multiplication and core math skills in general.\n\nFrom the App Store:\n\n\"Simply put: best multiplication app we’ve tried. The games require you to do math; tricky tables is a great way to work through mistakes; you can adjust settings for the math- and timer-anxious child. Really excellent design.\"\n\n\"My son liked saving/collecting the squeebles and reading their style/strengths the way he does Pokemon cards. And he learned all his times tables thru 12 in two sessions after struggling for weeks.\"\n\n\"I decided to purchase this for our 6 children to help them learn the times tables in a fun way.  It is a great app: they all enjoy it, it is easy to use, and best of all, they are learning their tables.\"\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions for features, please e-mail info@keystagefun.co.uk"

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

All for fraction of the cost of other consulting guides, and available anywhere you have your phone (full offline functionality).\n\nMemorizing frameworks is not good preparation for a consulting case study interview. You need to be at ease in the consulting case setting. Proficiency with 'case study math' is crucial for that. Use CaseBase to learn the techniques, practice the math, and put it all into use with case studies sourced from the leading consulting firms.\n\nFEATURES\n> Over 50 case pages sourced from recent Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey, and Bain interviews.\n> Automated answer checks for all calculation problems (precise and estimated). Recommended responses for free form questions.\n> Detailed explanations for each question and subsection, with step by step guide to each answer.\n> Intuitive interface, color graphics with each case.\n> Built to run offline. No wifi needed, no data used.\n> Tiny storage footprint. Consistently among the smallest apps on user devices. \n\nPRAISE FOR CASEBASE\n5-STARS\n“Great prep. As someone whose works in management consulting and has gone through tons of cases with applicants, I'll say this app is great preparation whether sitting down for a while to hammer on a case or quickly flipping through some mental math.”\n\nFrom the creators of CaseMath: Case Interview Math Prep.\n\nFull email support at support@caseinterviewprep.com\n\nFrom The Wall Street Journal:\n\n\"Mel Wolfgang, BCG's head of recruiting in the Americas, interviews about 100 students every year and says he can tell when someone sounds too \"scripted.\" \"It's sort of painful,\" he says, about hearing such responses.\"\n\nABOUT CASEBASE\nConsulting case interview preparation is wasted time if it takes the wrong form. Today’s most commonly used guides outline elaborate frameworks for the reader to memorize and detail point by point how candidates should present themselves. But when you approach each case and question with a prefabricated answer your responses become formulaic, not insightful. Almost without exception, this is painfully obvious to the interviewer.\n\nAs with any pursuit, the best preparation will focus on building a solid foundation. That means developing a close familiarity with the material and calculations you’ll face in consulting case study interviews as well as learning to form and articulate conclusions based on limited information. \n\nThis guide was designed to provide that sort of preparation. First and foremost it offers instruction and practice in the type of math that underlies these case interviews. Then, with the accompanying cases you will break down and solve actual interview questions sourced from leading consulting firms."

Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Try this app!\n\n1. SOLVE REAL RUBIK'S CUBE\n    Place the Rubik's Cube in front of the camera, follow the prompts to scan the 6 Rubik's facets in turn, and then this app will show you the steps to solve the Rubik's Cube in 3D step by step!\n    Note: Automatic recognition of the Rubik's Cube needs to be done in a well-lit place, dim lighting environment will lead to recognition failure.\n    Tips: If the cube is not recognized when you scan it, you can rotate a random face of the cube and try scanning again.\n\n\n2. PLAY VIRTUAL RUBIK'S CUBE\n    Playing Rubik's Cube on iPhone feels playing a real one!\n    KEY FEATURES:\n    - Realistic 3D graphics makes you feel playing with real Rubik's Cube.\n    - Swipe the cube with your finger to rotate the layer of cube. Swipe through the blank area to rotate the cube.\n    - You can also tap the Undo button to undo the last action.\n    - Double-tap on the face of the cube to mark the face; double-tap again to remove it. After the face marked, subsequent rotations will generate guide lines to show the rotation action.\n    - Tilt the phone horizontally or vertically to change the viewing angle of the Rubik's Cube.\n    - Rubik's Cubes of 2, 3, 4 and 5- order included.\n   \nSuggestions or questions?

Monster Phonics has also been selected by BETT futures as one of the top 20 most inspiring new ed-tech ideas in the UK. This app supports the reading and spelling of the first 100 high frequency words and is part of a wider phonics scheme that supports the New Curriculum for Spelling (KS1) and phonics in Reception.\n\nMonster Phonics is a synthetic phonics scheme. It is unique in that it uses character (monster) phoneme cues and colour coding to represent the sounds A, E, I, O, U, oo, ow, silent letters and tricky letters. Each monster and its corresponding colour is linked to a specific set of graphemes that makes the particular phoneme.\n\nMonster Phonics Apps have been developed specifically to make phonics more accessible for all learners. The revolutionary use of colour coding and characterisation has been proven to dramatically accelerate progress in reading. Monster Phonics also teaches handwriting and the correct letter formation for the first 100 words.\n\nThis Monster Phonics APP show how the first 100 words are more accessible to children because of the use of colour. The number of “tricky” words is reduced considerably with the colour coding system. There will be 2 Monster Phonics APPs covering the first 300 words. Once learned these words stay with children forever. The first 300 words make up 65% of all reading texts. Learning these words quickly is incredibly important for all children.\n\nSelected to be in the BETT Futures Cohort - January 2015!"

      "label": "The ABRSM Violin Scales Trainer is your all-in-one companion for practising scales.  The app covers all scales requirements at ABRSM Grades 1-5 from the current Violin syllabus and is also suitable for Initial Grade within Grade 1!\n\nWhat does ABRSM Violin Scales Trainer include?\nAn extensive set of resources to help you practise your scales and learn the requirements for your Practical Grades and enhance your performance:\n\nPractice Area\n• Notation for every scale, including suggested fingering and positioning. \n• Example performances of every scale, for you to compare your own playing against.\n• A built-in metronome to help you see how close you are to exam tempo. Start slow and gradually build up the speed!\n• A unique backing track for every scale. \n\nTest Area\nIf you fancy a quick warm-up or to put yourself to the test, then the Test Area is for you! This area selects a series of scales from the requirements for you to perform. Use the record function, reflect critically and rate your performance.\n \nPractice Meter\nThe more you use Violin Scales Trainer, the smarter it gets. The Practice Meter lets you see at a glance which scales you’re doing well at, and which ones need more practice.\n\nWhy Practise Scales?\nTime devoted to these exercises within each practice session will improve many aspects of technique, such as co-ordination, string crossing, bow control, position changes and tone production. In addition, the sense of key and pattern acquired through familiarity with scales and arpeggios has several benefits: it speeds up the learning of new pieces, builds aural awareness, increases familiarity with the geography of the instrument, and helps develop fine intonation, evenness of line and quality of tone."

See our other accent reduction apps and books on www.batcsglobal.com.\n\nThis new app provides a total solution for accent reduction.\n\nContent\n\nYou practice English pronunciation first in words, then in useful phrases, short sentences, amusing verses, rhythmic and articulation exercises and short passages. We selected the most essential vocabulary for those who begin to learn English.\n\nFunctionality\n\n• The app plays audio tracks;\n• Students can repeat, copy pronunciation, liaisons, and intonation;\n• Students can record themselves;\n• Students can hear their voice and compare their pronunciation with the model.\n\n\nThe app will help you sound confident and educated. You will:\n\n• Master all English sounds of RP (Received Pronunciation). RP is the neutral accent of educated southern English and the chief accent taught to foreigners who wish to learn the British model. In the past it was also referred to as Oxford English, Queens English, or BBC English;\n• Drill articulation exercises, consonant clusters and word endings to make your consonants clear and crisp;\n• Learn patterns of English intonation and sentence stress;\n• Master fluency, speaking in phrases, linking words together.\n\n\nThis is what people say about this new book:\n\n\"This is a book useful for both those starting on the path of accent reduction and those that have used any of the previous books by Olga and Linda (my case). The method is the same, but this volume concentrates on the most used words and expressions of daily life and I have found it really helpful in correcting my pronunciation of many commonly used phrases. I have also found the apps really helpful in comparing my pronunciation to the correct one, much more practical than the CDs.\" Alan Perez, Amazon customer\n\n\"Excellent book. As a teacher, I need to find a way to reduce my foreign accent, to deliver good lessons and clear information to my students. This book is a very recommended tool, you only need time to practise and repeat as much as you can the different activities.\" An Amazon customer"

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science.

      "label": "Welcome to the world of imagination and magic in The Fairy Tale Tarot! Brought to life by award winning artist/writer Lisa Hunt, The Fairy Tale Tarot encourages us to find new and deeper meaning in the familiar stories we’ve loved since childhood.\n\nThis is a very innovative Tarot, a deck that demands some degree of effort from readers. Each card relates to an entire fairy tale, keyed to the meanings of the Tarot. You will recognize many tales, like Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel, and Snow White. And you will learn new tales, drawn from Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Native America.\n\nMany of the Major Arcana are renamed in a fairy tale manner, such as Innocence for The Fool, The Fairy Godmother for The Empress, and Happily Ever After for The World. The elemental suits are artfully referenced in the Minor Arcana. The characters and plot of each fairy tale subtly convey the traditional meaning of the RWS cards.\n\nThis is a very deep and multi-layered Tarot. This deck encourages us to engage the world of fairy tales in a Jungian manner. Lisa Hunt’s art is so lovely that the wisdom and beauty of her writing is sometimes overlooked. Once Upon a Time, the book included in The Fairy Tale Tarot app, could easily stand alone as bedtime reading for children and adults. For a bedtime treat, let your child Pick A Card, and then read the resulting fairy tale aloud!\n\nOut of print and exorbitantly expensive as physical cards, The Fairy Tale Tarot by Lisa Hunt has never before been so beautifully showcased! The Fairy Tale Tarot presented by The Fool’s Dog also features a unique card, Snow White and Rose Red with their Bear, drawn expressly for this app.\n\n*Intuitive, elegant interface is easy for beginners and experts\n*Gorgeous full screen, high-resolution card images\n*Full support for all current iOS devices\n*Sophisticated journal\n*Includes full and unabridged book\n*20 spreads built in\n*Design your own layout with Free Form\n*Allow reversed cards or not\n*Option to use Major Arcana only\n*Zoom in to enlarge card details\n*Share reading via email, Facebook, and Twitter\n*Animated shuffle & cut\n*Optional voice prompts\n*Customize with your own card meanings & reading cloths\n*Many adjustable settings\n*Book and card meanings available in English only\n\nOpen your heart to the eternal wisdom of fairy tales, with The Fairy Tale Tarot!"

Open the app, find the channels list, look for the channel you want to watch and then press play. TV Launcher takes away that pain by allowing you to open any of the supported streaming apps directly to the channel.\n\n\nTV Launcher contains these great features:\n\nUS STREAMING PLATFORMS\n\nTV Launcher supports many US streaming platforms that have live TV! You’ll be able to jump straight to channels in CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX NOW, Discovery+, FXNOW, Pluto TV, TNT, TBS, Nat Geo TV, CNN, Bloomberg, DisneyNOW, ESPN and NBA.\n\n\nWIDGETS & SHORTCUTS\n\nYou don’t even have to open TV Launcher to get to the channel you want to watch. With the Widget, you can launch channels directly from your Home Screen and support for Siri Shortcuts means you can watch channels using just your voice!\n\n\nTV GUIDE\n\nChoose to see what's on now and up next or, view a full day's worth of listings so you can decide what to watch before choosing a channel.\n\n\nFAVORITES\n\nIf you have a select few channels you always like to watch, add them to your favorites list.\n\n\nHIDE CHANNELS\n\nNot interested in the news or don’t have kids? Choose the channels you want to hide and only keep around the ones you’re likely to watch. If you don’t have a streaming app installed, you can hide channels from those too.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNCING\n\nYour favorite channels, hidden channels and other settings all sync via iCloud so if you have multiple devices using TV Launcher, they'll all be kept in sync.\n\n\nREGION\n\nChoose from East or West so you get shown the channels you expect.\n\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nTV Launcher supports many layout configurations so you can organise your channels exactly how you’d like to find them. There’s options like a full list, grouping by app or even by category too.\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\n\nOnce you’ve organized your channels, choose how to display them with options like the ability to show channel names or group names.\n\n\nSEARCH\n\nIf you can’t find the channel you’re looking for, search for it!\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: support@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note that to watch a selected channel, you will need the respective app installed. TV Launcher cannot be guaranteed to work outside the US due to the selection of apps available in specific countries. All channels and their respective trademarks are owned by them and this app is not affiliated with them in any way."

      "label": "DeadBox is a Ghost Hunting App for communicating with spirits. It's similar to the Spirit Box and Ghost Box, you ask questions and look for intelligent and relevant responses to your questions. You should pick a location that is haunted, as ghosts need to be there to be able to respond. Be polite and treat with spirits with respect, as they were living people once, and being kind and friendly will increases your changes of them responding.\n\nThe Ghost Hunting App DeadBox has a built-in dictionary of words, which are picked at random. It is believed spirits and ghosts are able to manipulate electronic devices, and can override the app and pick words themselves. If you are getting random responses to your questions, there may be no spirits around at the time. Or they may not wish to communicate. Try again at another time or a different location. Just like when communicating with a Spirit Box or Ghost Box, think of engaging questions.\n\nDead Box is similar to the Ovilus and Paratek, but with a different and more relevant set of words. And we have given the app a creepy vibe and feel to help make your ghost hunting experience more exiting. There are no advertisements, no instore purchases, and your can change the scan speed. There is a history page so you can view previously picked words, it shows the date and time they were picked."

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

Watching all the animals go to sleep is a lovely way to set the mood for bedtime.\n\n\"You feel as if you are playing inside of a beautifully animated movie.\" // USA TODAY / 4 stars out of 4\n\n\"Nighty Night!\" is brought to you from Oscar-Nominee Heidi Wittlinger (2002, best animated short) who brings a lot of passion and effort in constructing little sets made of paper and combining them with 2D illustration and animation.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n1. Stunning designs by Oscar nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger \n2. Illustration and animation in 2D\n3. Thirteen interactive animals (Dog, Pig, Sheep, Duck, Cow, Fish, Chicken, Pony, Spider, Goat, Cats, Rabbit etc.) \n6. Switch between winter and summer version\n7. Autoplay function \n8.

Since then a lot has changed, but many of us remember the days when there was no Graphical User Interface.\n\nThis app now is introducing DOS for mobile devices. Not laptops, but phones. iPhone and iPad, to be precise. It is a perfect emulator of the DOS that so many games and applications in the 80'ies and 90'ies have been running on.\n\nWin and Win95 were running on DOS, showing what a 16bit operating system is capable of. If sys ini, commanc.com, config.sys and .exe sound familiar to you, then this is the app for you.\n\nThe DOS is not just a CLI, it is a full fledged operating system. It does everything that the Ancient DOS did. It is capable of executing batch files or installing some of the game classics that never made it past DOS. It probably runs much better than the original DOS used to run on old PC's, which were state of the art back then.\n\n30 years is old enough to be called vintage, and it brings as much power as it did back then ;-) With this app you can get this vintage feeling on your iPhone or iPad.\n\n◆Features\n    ▸ SoundCard emulation\n    ▸ External Bluetooth Keyboard\n    ▸ Disk Operating System\n    ▸ Everything you would expect from DOS ;)\n\nIf you have ideas, feedback, suggestions or anything else you would like to tell us, do not hesitate to drop us a line!\n\nAnd if you like Power DOS, be not shy to leave a good review!"

      "label": "Thunder for Philips Hue done right. Finally.\n\nMeet the most spectacular and realistic Thunder Ambiance app available for Philips Hue. It's truly immersive. \n\nHue Thunder provides an unique thunder simulation in various settings. Every time you start one of the ambiances it will be different and unpredictable. Al light effects have been precisely created and synced with thunder sound to create and impressive simulation with your Philips Hue setup. It will impress everyone.\nHue thunder can also be used to train pets to get used to thunder sounds and lightning flashes.\n\nOur unique node based soundscape engine, which is behind the beautiful designed and intuitive user interface, is truly innovative. It uses techniques which are used by top game designers and audio engineers to mimic nature's way and randomness. On top of that our soundscape apps use a unique and simple to use occurrence slider to let you decide how often a specific bird or other sound is used in the preset. Still it's totally unpredictable when a specific sound is being heard therefore producing an amazingly natural sound experience. It can run for hours on end without getting repetitive like other sound engines do. \n\nChoose from the following thunder presets and themes:\n\nThunder presets:\n- Light drizzle.\n- On a rainy day.\n- Heavy rain pours down.\n- Light thunder storm.\n- Inside the thunder storm.\n- Heavy thunder storm.\n- Tornado Alley.\n- Hurricane mayhem.\n\nThunder Ambient presets:\n- A damp rain forest.\n- At the beach after a warm day.\n- Staring out the window in a busy city.\n- A walk in the city under the umbrella.\n- Bad weather camping at the lake.\n- Storm over NYC.\n- After the storm.\n- In the car.\n- Bike ride through Amsterdam.\n\nThe following elements can be altered during playback:\n- Sky brightness.\n- Sky On/Off\n- Thunder brightness.\n- Thunder occurrence.\n- Environment volume.\n- Thunder volume.\n\nOther features:\n- Bluetooth and Airplay supported with delay compensation.\n- Sleep timer to safely fall asleep with a stormy fading background. Lights turn off after sleeptimer is finished.\n\n (Hue Thunder also works without Philips Hue, but obviously without light effects)."

      "label": "Life Simulation game with a lot of freedom!\nThe core of the game is that the player takes on the role of a child:\nFrom birth to kindergarten, primary schools, middle school, high school, college and beyond to finding a job, dating, getting married, having children and growing old!\nIt's not as simple as that, of course, but if it were, it would be less fun.\nThe game is, as I said at the beginning, \"high, high, high\" in terms of freedom.\nFamily backgrounds are completely random, it depends on your parents' position, your salary and savings, how many siblings you have, how many brothers and sisters you have, it all depends on your face.\nMaybe you're the offspring of some billionaire and you're at the top of your game!\nOf course there is also the possibility that you were born into some extraordinarily poor family.\nYour IQ, face value etc. are also randomly generated. This ensures that you experience a different life every time!\nThere are also various random events in the game, and often different choices lead to different lives, the so-called \"butterfly effect\".\nContinue to talk about the freedom of the game \"thief high thief high thief high\" ！！！！！！\nWhy do you say that?\nLet's briefly introduce the game below what you you can do with it. : - [I want to go to school].\n\n[Should I go to school]\nThe game allows players to decide whether they want to go to school or not, when they are old enough to go to school, everyone goes to school, but you can choose to continue to wander ~ (of course you will not be beaten up by your parents)\n(I can't guarantee if you'll get beaten up by your parents, of course)\n\nCan I pick up pretty girls at school?\nYou can choose the one you like, give her gifts, study with her (chat), and then your relationship grows, and then you know what to expect.\n(I'm not to blame if you fall behind in your studies, of course.\n\nCan I choose a good (or bad) school?\nThe game is designed with different levels of schools, so you can decide what school you want to go to based on your family's financial resources, and it's okay if you don't get into the university of your choice!\nAfter all, in this game \"there is nothing that money can't solve, if there is, it's not enough money!\". If there is, there is not enough money! It doesn't matter if you get a bad grade, I'll go even if I have the money to pay the high price! Don't me why, I have money to spare!\nI want to win at the starting line!\n\nI can get married\nThe game allows you to find the (beautiful/handsome) object you like, launch a wild pursuit, and finally get your hands on it!\n\nCan I have kids? Can I still have kids when I'm 100?\nHave a baby! If you dare to raise... I'll have kids! The game involves characters having children until they are 100 years old (of course, when it comes to the odds, it depends on your face).\nOr you can find a younger one when you're older, if you know what I mean.\n\nWhat if I can't have kids for whatever reason?\nYou don't have to worry about that. There is an adoption system inside the game; players can go there and browse around. You might just find an amazing child!\n\nCan I start a business?\nYou can be a worker, a part-time soul, a part-time person! But what if I don't want to work? You can choose to start your own business here. It's not a miracle that you can start your own business and turn your life around!\n\nCan I have special attributes (genes)?\nThere are many special genes in the game, such as the high IQ gene, the twin gene, the octuplets gene, the high face gene and so on. If you can think it, I can do it!\n\n\nCan I inherit my next generation when I get older?\nThe game allows players to inherit their own children. \"You can keep choosing the best offspring and inherit them. Then inherit and thus breed the perfect offspring!\n\nAnd ...... There are many, many more developers kakaku won't reveal too much~~\nFinally"

After all, counting by finger is funny but absolutely an impossible mission. So I came up with the idea of developing an app that would do it for me. Finally we've developed a reliable and one-of-its-kind algorithm for freckles detecting and counting. We would like to share this sunny app with you.\nNow you can also count freckles with “Freckle tracker” app on your face or on a one of your relatives, than share the results with your friends and invite them to do the same thing. \n \nSo easy it works: \n \n1. You have a choice either to pick an image of a person with freckles out of your smartphone gallery or to take a photo within the “Freckle tracker” app.\n2. Just after you pressed the \"count\" button, watch your freckles winking at you and discover how many of them you have. \n3. Afterwards, click the \"share\" icon and choose the way you want to send the results to your friends.\n4. Even if you don´t have any freckles, just be amazed playing the sunny game, guessing the number of freckles on other people faces.\n \nWe appreciate your ratings. And please don't hesitate to provide your hints and wishes on how we can improve our App. Send us your counting results, and we will with pleasure update our game library with your images.\n \nWe are pretty sure that after playing around with this app, at least a smile will appear on your face. \n\nDid we arouse your interest? Then download the app and click on \"?\" icon, to learn more about how to increase counting accuracy.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n******\nSchon seit langem war ich mit der Frage beschäftigt: Wie zähle ich die Sommersprossen auf der Nase meiner Tochter? Schließlich ist das Zählen mit dem Finger zwar eine lustige aber eben auch eine absolut mühselige Beschäftigung. Dann kam ich auf die Idee, eine App zu entwickeln, die es für mich erledigt. Am Ende haben wir es geschafft, einen zuverlässigen, einzigartigen Algorithmus zu entwickeln: dieser erkennt und zählt für Dich Sommersprossen. Diese sonnige App möchten wir mit Dir teilen. \n\nNun kannst auch Du Mithilfe der „Freckle tracker“ App Deine Sommersprossen und die Deiner Lieben zählen, die Zählergebnisse mit der Welt teilen und Deine Freunde dazu einladen, sich auch damit zu beschäftigen. \n \nSo einfach wird´s gemacht:\n \n1.  Du hast die Wahl, entweder ein Foto einer Person mit Sommersprossen aus der Galerie Deines Smartphones zu schnappen oder es direkt auf der „Freckle tracker“ App mit der Kamera aufzunehmen.\n2.  Sobald Du auf den \"count\" Button drückst, kannst du sehen wie Deine Sommersprossen Dich anblinzeln und gleich danach erfährst Du wie viele es sind.\n3.  Klicke auf das Symbol \"share\" und wähle aus, wie Du das Foto mit dem Zählergebnis an Deine Freunde senden möchtest.\n4.  Wenn Du keine Sommersprossen hast, dann lass dich einfach verzaubern und spiele das sonnige Spiel und rate die Anzahl der Sommersprossen auf Gesichtern anderer Leute. \n \nWir freuen uns auf Deine Bewertung sowie Anregungen und Vorschläge, wie wir unsere App verbessern können. Sende uns auch Deine Zählergebnisse, und wir erweitern unsere Spielbibliothek mit Deinen Fotos.\n \nWir sind ziemlich zuversichtlich, dass nach dem Rumspielen mit dieser App, sich ein Lächeln auf Deinem Gesicht zeigen wird. \n\nHaben wir Dein Interesse geweckt? Dann lade die App runter und klicke auf \"?\" Symbol um mehr darüber zu erfahren, wie Du die Zählgenauigkeit erhöhen kannst.\n\nViel Spaß beim Zählen!\n\n© Copyright 2019 Bantique´s production.

Use the search bar to quickly find your minifigures by unique ID, name, or set number. You can swipe between minifigure entries to easily update your collection! Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes. You can also add multiple of the same minifigure to your collection and then track your total progress on the My Collection tab.\n\nLegal Information:\n\nLEGO and the minifigure are registered trademarks of the LEGO Group.\n\nSTAR WARS is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm, Ltd.

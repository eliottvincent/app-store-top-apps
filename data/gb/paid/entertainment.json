But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory.

This was in the 60'ies of the last century. Since then a lot has changed, but many of us remember the days when there was no Graphical User Interface.\n\nThis app now is introducing DOS for mobile devices. Not laptops, but phones. iPhone and iPad, to be precise. It is a perfect emulator of the DOS that so many games and applications in the 80'ies and 90'ies have been running on.\n\nWin and Win95 were running on DOS, showing what a 16bit operating system is capable of. If sys ini, commanc.com, config.sys and .exe sound familiar to you, then this is the app for you.\n\nThe DOS is not just a CLI, it is a full fledged operating system. It does everything that the Ancient DOS did. It is capable of executing batch files or installing some of the game classics that never made it past DOS. It probably runs much better than the original DOS used to run on old PC's, which were state of the art back then.\n\n30 years is old enough to be called vintage, and it brings as much power as it did back then ;-) With this app you can get this vintage feeling on your iPhone or iPad.\n\n◆Features\n    ▸ SoundCard emulation\n    ▸ External Bluetooth Keyboard\n    ▸ Disk Operating System\n    ▸ Everything you would expect from DOS ;)\n\nIf you have ideas, feedback, suggestions or anything else you would like to tell us, do not hesitate to drop us a line!\n\nAnd if you like Power DOS, be not shy to leave a good review!"

      "label": "TV Launcher brings over 100 live UK TV channels that you know and love into one convenient launcher on your iPhone & iPad - perfect for cord-cutters!\n\n\n* As featured on iMore & 9to5Mac *\n\n\nThe Apple TV app makes it easy to track the programmes you’re watching but if you’re still wanting to watch live, you know the score. Open the app, find the channels list, look for the channel you want to watch and then press play. TV Launcher takes away that pain by allowing you to open any of the supported streaming apps directly to the channel.\n\n\nTV Launcher contains these great features:\n\nUK STREAMING PLATFORMS\n\nTV Launcher supports all of the main UK streaming platforms that have live TV and a few more too! You’ll be able to jump straight to channels in BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, My5, NOW (Sky), Discovery+, TalkTV, euronews, France 24, Al Jazeera and Bloomberg. There's also support for quick access to UKTV Play, Pluto TV, DAZN, STV Player and RTÉ Player as well which unfortunately don't support launching channels fully.\n\n\nWIDGETS & SHORTCUTS\n\nYou don’t even have to open TV Launcher to get to the channel you want to watch. With the Widget, you can launch channels directly from your Home Screen and support for Siri Shortcuts means you can watch channels using just your voice!\n\n\nTV GUIDE\n\nChoose to see what's on now and up next or, view a full day's worth of listing so you can decide what to watch before choosing a channel.\n\n\nFAVOURITES\n\nIf you have a select few channels you always like to watch, add them to your favourites list.\n\n\nHIDE CHANNELS\n\nNot interested in the news or don’t have kids? Choose the channels you want to hide and only keep around the ones you’re likely to watch. If you don’t have a streaming app installed, you can hide channels from those too.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNCING\n\nYour favourite channels, hidden channels and other settings all sync via iCloud so if you have multiple devices using TV Launcher, they'll all be kept in sync.\n\n\nREGION\n\nDifferent parts of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland & Northern Ireland) have slight variations to their standard channels. Choose your region in the settings menu and you’ll be shown the channels you expect.\n\n\nORGANISATION\n\nTV Launcher supports many layout configurations so you can organise your channels exactly how you’d like to find them. There’s options like a full list, grouping by app or even by category too.\n\n\nCUSTOMISATION\n\nOnce you’ve organised your channels, choose how to display them with options like the ability to show channel names or group names.\n\n\nSEARCH\n\nIf you can’t find the channel you’re looking for, search for it!\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: support@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note that to watch a selected channel, you will need the respective app installed. TV Launcher cannot be guaranteed to work outside the UK due to the selection of apps available in specific countries. All channels and their respective trademarks are owned by them and this app is not affiliated with them in any way."

Others claim that absolutely \nnothing is taking place, \njust happenstance or imagination.  \n\nMany users see these type of devices \nas a tool for paranormal investigation. \nThe softwares author Digital Dowsing llc \nfeels the device should be used for experimentation  \nnot a tool for Investigation.  \n\nThis Application was written \nfor experienced ITC researchers, not designed as a \nparty favor or game.\n\n=========================\nVersion 2.0\nRequires OS 7 or Higher \nFor the iPad or iPhone \n** Designed for experienced ITC   Experimenters\n  \n=========================\n\nSo what can a user expect? \nThe idea is simple if you believe \nthat communication Is possible.  \nITC would be a great first step. \nITC reads the environment and \ncreates speech fragments. \n\nAs the device runs it  slices speech \ninto small fragments. Like tuning a radio as \nthe dial moves you hear  short sound bits. \n\nBy scanning the ITC creates speech and \nspeech like sounds.  \n\nDigital dowsing has produced this type of \ndevice for several years now.  \nUsing the experience gained from actual \nhardware production, Digital Dowsing \nreproduces real world functions in this \niPhone,iPad application.  \n\nPlease don't purchase this application if \nyour expecting perfect results. \n\nThis is a tool for experimentation,\nnot a telephone.  \n\nResults will depend on effort  \ntime and patience. \nITC \" trans Instrumental Communications \" \nis not a science it's a method.   \n\nWill it work for you, The answer is no... \nIt will only work with you. \n\nThe method  is not a fortune teller. \nDon't expect answers to life. \nExpect the responses that  make \nyou laugh or challenge you Ideas \nand concepts of what is \nreally going on.\n\nBecause of the nature of this application \nit is offered for \nexperimnetal purposes only.\n\nThe Author of this software is the Inventor \nof the Paranormal Puck, OvilusTalker,\nEM Pump, Video Ovilus, PX, SLS and many other devices. \n\nFor more details please visit www.DigitalDowsing.com\n\nHow ITC works:\nITC uses files that are played for different \nlengths of time depending on settings, \nand started in different segments of the \nspeech based on the mode and inputs. \n\nIt is not possible to put the spoken words \non the screen, each word is built from many \ndifferent words or word fragments.\n\n\nFor more details please visit www.DigitalDowsing.com"

      "label": "**** As seen on Nick Jr. ****\n\nWelcome to the Big Outdoors, Squirrels! Introducing the latest app featuring Hey Duggee! Safe, ad-free fun for your little ones.\n\nJoin Duggee and the Squirrels as they work hard to earn seven brand new badges: \n\n•\tCatch the falling acorns; \n•\tGrow your own fruit and veg; \n•\tRound up the missing sheep; \n•\tLearn Duggee’s raindance; \n•\tPilot your submarine in an underwater adventure; \n•\tMake a paper boat to help the ants!\n•\tAnd finally, hit the beach and build a glorious sandcastle.\n\nCompleting each activity earns the Squirrel a badge. With 5 Squirrels playing for 7 badges each, that’s a whole lot of Duggee Hugs!\n\nKey Features:\n\n•\tSeven fun activities with a variety of gameplay styles \n•\tDevelop fine motor control skills in the Acorn Badge \n•\tImprove attention skills, reaction times and speech skills in the Food Growing Badge \n•\tPractice counting in the Sheep Badge  \n•\tPromote gross motor control skills in the Raindance Badge \n•\tDevelop concentration and planning skills in the Submarine Badge\n•\tEncourage creativity in the Paper Boat and Sandcastle Badges\n•\tVisit your gallery to see all of your wonderful adventures\n\nGames:\n\nThe Acorn Badge\nSome animals collect acorns to eat through the winter. Use your excellent catching skills to fill your cart with lots of lovely acorns! Look out for those elusive Special Acorns! And be careful not to slip on the banana skins...\n\nThe Food Growing Badge\nShall we grow our own fruit and veg, Squirrels? First, you plant your seed. Next, you cover it with soil. And finally, you give it a lovely big drink of water! You’ll need to protect your plant from pests… and you’ll need to talk to it to help it grow. What green fingers you have!\n\nThe Sheep Badge\nThe sheep are missing? Let’s round them all up! Twist and weave your way through the trees and bushes, picking up sheep as you go. 1 sheep, 2 sheep, 3 sheep… all the way up to 10 sheep! Are you keeping count? \n\nThe Raindance Badge\nA raindance is a dance that people do to try to make it rain! This game will really get you moving. First, you’ll need to learn the steps: Clap, clap, wiggle, jump! Now you know the moves, let’s dance along to the music. Excellent…you’ve made it rain!\n\nThe Submarine Badge\nHow exciting... an underwater adventure! Use your finger to track the bubbles and watch as the submarine follows the trail. Collect a Jazz Fish and it’ll play you a rhythmic tune. See if you can spot the Giant Sea Stallion! \n\nThe Paper Boat Badge\nOh no! The Ants are late for their picnic! Let’s make them a paper boat to get them safely across the pond. Practice your origami with some skillful folding. Once you’ve crafted your paper boat, finish it off with some nautical decorations. Lastly, shout ‘faster!’ and watch your boat speed across the water. \n\nThe Sandcastle Badge\nIt’s the summer holidays and Duggee’s organised a day trip to the beach! Help the Squirrels earn their badge by building a fortress made of sand!  \n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

Missiles fired at the player from the tops of buildings again become a threat. \n\nLevel 5.- Sends the player into obnoxiously tight machine tunnels. Pilot error is the only though formidable enemy. \n\nThe final level has the player make an attack run on the Base, defended only by its position in a deep valley. After the destruction of the Base, the player begins again."

When Bomb Jacke is jumping if tap Bomb Jacke glides in the air.\n\nThe Game\n-------------\n\nThe player controls Bomb Jacke, a superhero mighty mouse who can leap and glide. Someone has planted 24 bombs at landscapes. Bomb Jacke must fly around the screen to collect the bombs. Each screen uses a different configuration of platforms upon which Bomb Jacke may run and jump. Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty.\n\nBomb Jacke \"defuses\" the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb's fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching 20 or more bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Bomb Jacke may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game's bonuses and power-ups. The lit fuses have no strategic purpose other than the bonus; a lit bomb left unattended does not explode.\n\nYou control Bomb Jacke throughout the game. Bomb Jacke one and only mission is to collect all of the bombs in the stage before moving on to the next and collecting more. In his way will be several enemies which will seek to stop him. Bomb Jacke will lose one life any time he comes into contact with any of the enemies. There is no time limit, so Bomb Jacke can take as long as he needs to clear the stage. However, the longer you wait, the more likely it is that the enemies will overwhelm him. Bomb Jacke can turn the tables on his enemies by collecting a power coin (P), which will temporarily turn all of the enemies into coins which he can collect. Whether Bomb Jacke earns extra lives by reaching certain coins.\n\nPower Coin (P), Obtainable after meter filling the Bonus Multiplier 20 segments: unlit bombs by 1, and lit bombs by 2.\n\nBonus Coin (B), Obtainable every time the score reaches a multiple of 5,000, until the Bonus Multiplier reaches x5 per level.\n\nExtra Coin (E), Obtainable when Bomb Jacke has \"killed\" enough enemies by collecting them as Coins, and score reaches multiple of 50,000.\n\nEnjoy it!!!!"

      "label": "\"Become a paranormal investigator too with the amazing new Pro del Pit app. Have fun testing your courage or put yourself in the shoes of a paranormal investigator.\n\nThe Ghost Finder contains the three most important tools used by investigators of the paranormal: The Ghost Box, the M1 and the Rem, developed ad hoc by the Pit Team.\n\nGHOST BOX:\n\nThe Ghost Box or Spirit Box is an AM FM radio that quickly changes the frequency for the purpose of listening to EVPs.\n\nThis radio varies the frequency with a rhythm ranging from 100 milliseconds to 500 milliseconds and the resulting electronic voice tends to take effect from the white noise of the frequency.\n\nM1:\n\nThe M1 is an electromagnetic field meter. Thanks to the magnetometers present in the latest generation mobile phones *, you too can try your hand at researching variations in the electromagnetic field.\n\nIts functions are similar to those of a KII but enhanced for use on a smartphone. The more the electromagnetic field variations will be strong, the more the LEDs will light up to red.\n\nREM:\n\nThe Rem is an electronic device that allows you to receive answers to your questions.\n\nThe Rem has a built-in word database. Whenever a considerable variation in electromagnetism is recorded, the amplitude and intensity values ​​are combined to select a word from the reference database.\n\nThe first screen will show the word while the second will record the electromagnetism variations that caused the selection of that word.\n\nBLACK BOX:\nThis fantastic instrument perceives random chaotic noise and connects to a phonetic database from which it is possible to listen to the formation of words divided into syllables. Ask your question and listen to the answers that will come. Try to understand the words that will come out by joining the single phonemes.\n\nINFO ON OPERATION:\n\nTo test m1 just enter M1 function and approach an electrical socket or an electronic device on and the instrument will immediately show a change in magnetism.\n\nThanks to an algorithm developed by Team Pit, the App creates a triangulation between the three magnets inside the latest generation mobile phones to accurately calculate the magnetic anomalies in the environment.\n\n*ATTENTION*\n\nIn older mobile phones without the 3 magnetometers now used in most mobile phones, the app will not work properly and the M1 will light up with just the movement of the mobile phone. This is because it will simulate a compass and give false positive answers to just the movement of the mobile. \""

Select a keyword / phrase you want to change from the web page, when it disappears or changes, the browser will stop refreshing and sound an Alarm!.\n\nThe Browser Features:\n-Refresh until word or phrase no longer appears on the page (this means you are no longer stuck on the holding page)\n-Auto Detect if page failed to load.\n-Prevent the iPhone or iPad going to sleep\n-Two search methods \n-Refresh until word Appears \n-Refresh until word Disappears / changes\n-Change the refresh speed.\nExample uses:\n- Sales sites: Get an advantage with sneaker sales, new exclusive phone sales and clothing sales.  Sometimes you need to keep refreshing a website just before a sale starts, choose a keyword or phrase like ‘currently unavailable’ and the app will keep refreshing until the word disappears, i.e the sale is on. This can give you the vital seconds required to purchase / cop that exclusive sales item.  \n\n- Ticketing sites: will often keep you in a queue on a web page known as a ‘holding page’, on some sites refreshing this page can get you through to the purchase page. This is where The Refreshinator helps, More refreshes = More chances of a ticket. When you are stuck on a \"holding page\", The Refreshinator can be set to automatically refresh the holding page until you get onto the purchase area. As each refresh is a chance, the speed you refresh the page counts Increases your chances. The Refreshinator can do this faster than a person and can drastically improve your chances of getting through a ticket queue. The App was used to purchase tickets in the Glastonbury ticket sale and Glastonbury Resale, it get through to the purchase area over ten times in an average of 30 seconds. Once in 3 seconds.\n\n- Chat rooms / sports sites:  Some sites do not refresh when updates occur, you can set the Refreshinator to Refresh a site until a a game finishes or a chat group updates, in these scenarios we recommend using a a refresh rate of 5 - 15 seconds as updates are not so frequent.\n\n- Job listings, some site put up job listing at a given point of time however watching and refreshing the site continuously is a chore. Just put in the key word or phrase and set the app to keep refreshing until the listing appears."

      "label": "Necrophone Pro is a real ghost app designed specifically for spirit communication and paranormal research. This spirit box contains a preloaded soundbank with a large variety of words, similar to ghost tube.\n\nNew features in the ghost box include white noise, reverb and echo. This ITC ghost hunting app has a very creepy vibe, and gives good results whilst trying to communicate with the dead.\n\nThe sound bank files use a the full range of low, mid and high frequencies making it much easier for communication with the dead.\n\nOur real ghost app contains full and partial words in English at varying quality levels. And partial words in other languages. Sample partial phonetic words include things such as bi, bo, um, ye, na.\n\nOur spirit box may sound similar to other ghost hunting tools such as Necrophonic, Paratek ghost box, DeadWave spirit box and Ghost Tube.\n\nThe white noise background in our real ghost app can be turned on and off, and the background is a moving video to give a creepy and spooky vibe to get you in the mood for your ghost hunting app.\n\nIf you want to record your spirit box session you can use a separate EVP recorder or ghost tube with it. Or use with an EMF meter to detect any electrical spikes while using Necrophone ghost hunting tools to communicate with the spirits. Or an SLS camera, like ghost tube to be able to see them as well.\n\n*No Advertisements\n*No Popups\n*No Subscriptions\n*No In App Purchases\n*Lifetime Use\n\nQUICK TIPS: Never go out alone, especially in abandoned places, always take a friend or family member to stay safe when using ghost hunting tools. Ensure you choose a location which is known to be haunted. As no real responses will come through if there are no spirits. Only randomly generated words. Always be polite to the spirits and don't challenge them whilst using ghost hunting tools.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This ghost hunting app picks words at random from the word bank. It is believed that ghosts are able to manipulate electrical devices, and may be able to override the words which the ghost box picks. But there is no guarantee or scientifical evidence to prove this. So please use our real ghost app at your own risk.\n\n\nHow to get the most from your ghost hunting tools\n\n1. Before using your ghost hunting app, picked a haunted place. No real ghost app will work if there are not any ghosts in the location you are at. First find a haunted location, which will dramatically increase the chances of getting replies from your ghost app or spirit box.\n\n2. Once you have picked your haunted location, take some friends or family members with you to ensure your safety whilst using your real ghost app. Using your real ghost app and ghost box is always more fun with friends.\n\n3. Once you arrive at the haunted place, say hello to the spirits and introduce yourself before using your ghost hunting tools. Treat spirits like people, they will be much more likely to respond if you are polite to them. Once ready, you can start your real ghost app session. Start your ghost box and ask if any spirits are there. Once you start getting intelligent responses from the ghost app or spirit box, you can start documenting your evidence.\n\nYOUR GHOST BOX AND SPIRIT BOX CAN BE VERY HELPFUL COMMUNICATION WITH THE OTHER SIDE. But you also need to increase your chances be ensuring spirits are there, and you are polite to them. Don't just ask the same repetitive questions, think of something new, original and engaging."

      "label": "The companion app to the popular book \"The Serpent and the Jaguar,\" the award-winning MCP Mayan Tzolkin gives you the authentic Mayan Tzolkin calendar the way the living Maya practice it. This app follows the sacred traditional count of the Kiche Maya, and is in no way related to the \"Dreamspell\" or \"13-moon\" calendar, invented in the 20th century.\n\nWe designed the MCP Mayan Tzolkin to connect you with the energies of the sacred Tzolkin calendar—perhaps the most well known of all the Mayan calendars—and to understand the meaning of the Tzolk’in’s essential building blocks: the day signs and the numbers. \n\nFor the first time, the entire series of these energies is now available in their complete form, and on a mobile platform—260 unique daily energies finely tuned to the realities of modern day life. \n\nMCP Mayan Tzolkin features: \n• Complete set of the 260 “Energies of the Day,” each energy thoughtfully interpreted for the context of modern-day life, taking into account not only the meaning of the day sign and numeral, but also the general context of the current Trecena \n• Sophisticated, beautifully rendered glyph, number and deity graphics \n• The well-known Mayan Calendar Portal Tzolkin calendar rings, in full dynamic, interactive mode \n• Explanation of the nature, meaning and purpose of the sacred Tzolk’in, including listings of the 20 day signs and 13 numbers in both Yucatec and K’iche’ Maya \n• A calculator to convert Gregorian (Western) dates into Tzolkin dates \n• Full descriptions of the 20 sacred day signs and the 13 numbers, based on the traditions of the Maya of Guatemala \n• Full descriptions of the 13 deities associated with the thirteen numbers \n\nWhile other apps generally take their day sign, number and “energy of the day” descriptions from various non-Maya sources, the “Energies of the Day” in our app are based on authentic interpretations and practices of the Tzolkin that have been made available to us by the Maya of the Guatemalan highlands and Maya scholars with long years of experience living and working with the Maya. \n\nBACKGROUND \nSince ancient times, the Maya have used the 260-day Tzolkin as their personal astrological calendar. Incredibly accurate regardless of culture, race, gender, faith, or ethnicity, the Tzolkin remains, to this day, profoundly relevant to the human experience—including our modern lives and lifestyles. Unlike the now-defunct Long Count calendar whose latest cycle ended on 12.21.2012, and whose original usage and meaning has been completely overrun by popular notions of doomsday scenarios, the sacred Tzolk’in is a deeply personal astrological calendar. \n\nPRAISE \nCheck out what people have been saying about the Energies of the Day since the very first day we published them: \n\n~ THANK YOU! You speak right from the bottom of my soul. This is exactly what I've been going through lately... \n~ Thank you so much for the insight. I always start my day here :) \n~ Wow, the sync that this post has today with me, [is] completely relevant to my situation. I really enjoy your posts MCP … this is amazing info! \n~ This is so accurate it's scary some days... and I don't believe in zodiac and horoscopes and stuff like that usually. \n~ I got chills reading this… something is VERY on point here... \n~ I would just like to say thank you for the effort and energy that you extend to putting these [energies] together for our benefit at this cycle in time of our existence. \n\n\nThe Mayan Calendar Portal and all of its properties, including the MCP Mayan Tzolkin mobile application, are produced by LUCITÀ Inc."

      "label": "This is a straightforward yet powerful app that acts as a polyphonic audio synthesizer with a virtually unlimited collection of sounds. Under the hood, It uses an AVAudioUnitSampler to generate the audio output when you touch one or more keys. The sounds that are available come from soundfont (SF2)  files, such as those available online for free (and of variable quality). \n\nThe app also exists as an AUv3 plug-in (included) so you can use it in your favorite music generation application such as GarageBand, Logic, or AUM. It also includes two AUv3 effects units – reverb and delay - which you can use separately as well..\n\nThe app supports MIDI input -- just connect a MIDI keyboard/controller to your iOS device and you should be good to go! There is also support for MIDI over Bluetooth.\n\nTo use, simply select a SoundFont name in the left list, then a patch name on the right and start playing. Some additional hints to get going:\n\n• Add a SoundFont (SF2) file that you have downloaded onto your iCloud Drive. Press the \"+\" button and then locate the file to add. You can always change the display name of the SoundFont  by swiping right. And you can remove a SoundFont that you no longer want by swiping left on its name.\n\n• Bring up reverb and delay effects by touching the wavy \"signal\" button.\n\n• Swipe right on a patch name to make it a favorite. Favorited patches have a star next to their name. You can edit the name of the favorite by again swiping right and selecting the edit action. You can remove a favorite by swiping left and selecting the remove action.\n\n• Touch the labels at either end of the black bar to change the range of the keyboard. You can go as low as \"C0\" and as high as \"C9\". You can also change the range by swiping left/right on the black bar. Note that this ability does not exist in the AUv3 extension -- use the native application keyboard controls to achieve the same results. You can also toggle the keyboard sliding feature by touching the small arrow between the note labels.\n\n• Switch between the soundfont patches listing and the favorites view by double-tapping on the patch name in the black bar above the keyboard. You can also swipe left/right with two fingers in the patches and favorites views to switch to the other view.\n\n• In the view of favorites, you can edit a favorite button by double-tapping on it. You can rearrange the favorite buttons with a tap-and-hold gesture.\n\nFinally, you can check out the source code! Go to the Support URL to find out more."

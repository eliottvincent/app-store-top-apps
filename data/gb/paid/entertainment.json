Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes.

Open the app, find the channels list, look for the channel you want to watch and then press play. TV Launcher takes away that pain by allowing you to open any of the supported streaming apps directly to the channel.\n\n\nTV Launcher contains these great features:\n\nUS STREAMING PLATFORMS\n\nTV Launcher supports many US streaming platforms that have live TV! You’ll be able to jump straight to channels in CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX NOW, Discovery+, FXNOW, Pluto TV, TNT, TBS, Nat Geo TV, CNN, Bloomberg, DisneyNOW, ESPN and NBA.\n\n\nWIDGETS & SHORTCUTS\n\nYou don’t even have to open TV Launcher to get to the channel you want to watch. With the Widget, you can launch channels directly from your Home Screen and support for Siri Shortcuts means you can watch channels using just your voice!\n\n\nTV GUIDE\n\nChoose to see what's on now and up next or, view a full day's worth of listings so you can decide what to watch before choosing a channel.\n\n\nFAVORITES\n\nIf you have a select few channels you always like to watch, add them to your favorites list.\n\n\nHIDE CHANNELS\n\nNot interested in the news or don’t have kids?

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory.

No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

Have fun helping them to interact with their surroundings – kites, snowmen, sandcastles, balloons, windmills, a paddling pool, sprouting veg, bouncing pumpkins and lots more.  \n\nWhether it's a chicken, a rabbit, a cat or a hedgehog it'll need to be fed, watered, washed and exercised - not to mention a bit of extra TLC when it's feeling under the weather. \n\nSo keep a watchful eye on your expanding menagerie to make sure your animals have everything they need to make them happy! \n\nKey Features:\n\n•\tAn interactive app that encourages exploratory and open-ended gameplay; \n•\tFive locations to visit: a park, some woods, the beach, the snow and a field; \n•\tNine animals to collect: penguin, monkey, hedgehog, chicken, cat, frog, bird, rabbit and mouse; \n•\tStep by step guide on how to care for the animals; \n•\tPlayers learn to spot what an animal needs to keep it happy: Food, water, exercise, a wash and sometimes a bandage!; \n•\tPlaying the correct mini game gives the animal what they need and earns the player their We Love Animals Badge!\n\nFeeding: Enid the cat looks like she’s a little peckish! See if you can feed her the correct food from the conveyer belt. Give her enough of the food she likes and she’ll be happy again in no time!\n\nDrinking: I think Monkey could do with a drink. Let’s get him some water by connecting the pipes to the water fountain! What a splendid path you’ve chosen, Squirrel!\n\nWashing: How did Mouse get so dirty? She could do with a good wash! First get rid of the leaves… next, cover her in soap… and finally, pop every last one of the soapy bubbles! Excellent cleaning!\n\nExercising: An animal should be exercised daily! Help Norrie and Tag to get your animals skipping and you’ll have them fit and healthy before they know it!\n\nCaring: Frog’s gotten into a scrape! Not to worry… a few bandages in just the right places and he’ll be back to his old self before you can say “Ribbet!”.\n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

Frizzy hair, straight hair, blue hair…the choice is yours.\n  \nThe Drawing Badge\nSelect from different pens, pencils and paints to colour in the Squirrels - a pink and red Norrie with spots or a stripy Betty perhaps. When you’re happy with your drawing, watch with pride as Duggee displays your picture in the Clubhouse.\n \nThe Super Squirrel Badge\nDress up the Squirrels in an exciting range of heroic Super Squirrel outfits. Mix and match capes, masks, hats and more to style your Super Squirrel then watch them display their amazing costumes especially for you.\n \nThe Cake Badge\nThere’s lots of ingredients for you to add to your cake, so you’ll need to give it a good stir before Duggee pops it in the oven.

Like tuning a radio as \nthe dial moves you hear  short sound bits. \n\nBy scanning the ITC creates speech and \nspeech like sounds.  \n\nDigital dowsing has produced this type of \ndevice for several years now.  \nUsing the experience gained from actual \nhardware production, Digital Dowsing \nreproduces real world functions in this \niPhone,iPad application.  \n\nPlease don't purchase this application if \nyour expecting perfect results. \n\nThis is a tool for experimentation,\nnot a telephone.  \n\nResults will depend on effort  \ntime and patience. \nITC \" trans Instrumental Communications \" \nis not a science it's a method.   \n\nWill it work for you, The answer is no... \nIt will only work with you. \n\nThe method  is not a fortune teller. \nDon't expect answers to life. \nExpect the responses that  make \nyou laugh or challenge you Ideas \nand concepts of what is \nreally going on.\n\nBecause of the nature of this application \nit is offered for \nexperimnetal purposes only.\n\nThe Author of this software is the Inventor \nof the Paranormal Puck, OvilusTalker,\nEM Pump, Video Ovilus, PX, SLS and many other devices. \n\nFor more details please visit www.DigitalDowsing.com\n\nHow ITC works:\nITC uses files that are played for different \nlengths of time depending on settings, \nand started in different segments of the \nspeech based on the mode and inputs. \n\nIt is not possible to put the spoken words \non the screen, each word is built from many \ndifferent words or word fragments.\n\n\nFor more details please visit www.DigitalDowsing.com"

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

All of the former add-on features of the original version are now included as part of the base price.\n• New! Screensaver mode when running the app for extended periods of time. \n• New! Totally reimagined particle visualizations.\n• New! Stealth Skin\n• New! Dark theme backgrounds in the History and Features screens\n• New!

      "label": "Mahjong is an enjoyable game, played around the world. However, for beginners (and even more experienced players!), calculating the value of a hand can be confusing. On top of that, payments between players after the value of each hand is calculated can also be tricky.\n\nMahjong Helper aims to simplify the tasks of scoring and payments between games. It can also be used to keep a history of matches played, and to easily experiment with different methods of scoring.\n\nFeatures:\n* Multiple Matches\n* Beautiful, easy-to-read tiles.\n* Hand Scorer with intuitive tile/set-type selector (press, slide, and release to choose a tile)\n* Supports European Classical, Hong Kong, Japanese Modern / EMF Riichi (with Dora tiles and Red Fives), and Chinese Official (MCR / Competition) scoring\n* 4, 3, and 2 player scoring modes\n* Send scores from Hand Scorer to Score Sheet, or enter scores manually.\n* Score Sheet calculates payments between players, supports \"Ready\" declarations and counters in Japanese Mahjong.\n* see how the score is calculated on the \"Scoring\" panel - great for those learning the game, or just to double-check!\n* Supports seat rotation between rounds, or groups that prefer keeping the same positions throughout.\n* Share matches across devices - other players can keep a record of the match & contribute to scoring from their own devices.

It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

When Bomb Jacke is jumping if tap Bomb Jacke glides in the air.\n\nThe Game\n-------------\n\nThe player controls Bomb Jacke, a superhero mighty mouse who can leap and glide. Someone has planted 24 bombs at landscapes. Bomb Jacke must fly around the screen to collect the bombs. Each screen uses a different configuration of platforms upon which Bomb Jacke may run and jump. Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty.\n\nBomb Jacke \"defuses\" the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb's fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching 20 or more bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Bomb Jacke may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game's bonuses and power-ups. The lit fuses have no strategic purpose other than the bonus; a lit bomb left unattended does not explode.\n\nYou control Bomb Jacke throughout the game. Bomb Jacke one and only mission is to collect all of the bombs in the stage before moving on to the next and collecting more. In his way will be several enemies which will seek to stop him. Bomb Jacke will lose one life any time he comes into contact with any of the enemies. There is no time limit, so Bomb Jacke can take as long as he needs to clear the stage. However, the longer you wait, the more likely it is that the enemies will overwhelm him. Bomb Jacke can turn the tables on his enemies by collecting a power coin (P), which will temporarily turn all of the enemies into coins which he can collect. Whether Bomb Jacke earns extra lives by reaching certain coins.\n\nPower Coin (P), Obtainable after meter filling the Bonus Multiplier 20 segments: unlit bombs by 1, and lit bombs by 2.\n\nBonus Coin (B), Obtainable every time the score reaches a multiple of 5,000, until the Bonus Multiplier reaches x5 per level.\n\nExtra Coin (E), Obtainable when Bomb Jacke has \"killed\" enough enemies by collecting them as Coins, and score reaches multiple of 50,000.\n\nEnjoy it!!!!"

      "label": "Endless RPG is a random dungeon and adventure generator for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons and 1st Edition Pathfinder roleplaying games.\n\nThe Random Dungeon Generator is not a game. It is is a tool for playing pen-and-paper role-playing games alone, in a small group without a dungeon master, or with a dungeon master as either a standalone adventure or an easy way to get into the game.  \n\n*** D&D 5TH EDITION OR PATHFINDER 1E ***\n\nThe two most popular tabletop roleplaying systems are supported.  All standard bestiary is included for Pathfinder 1st edition, and D&D support includes the Tomb of Foes and Volo's Guide. These additional monster manuals can be turned on or off in settings, allowing you to customize the dungeon based on the books you own.\n\n*** PLAY SOLO OR IN A GROUP WITHOUT A DM ***\n\nThe Random Dungeon Generator allows you to explore a randomly-generated dungeon through a fog-of-war discovery system with encounters, traps, tricks and treasures shown as you encounter them.  This is perfect for solo play or groups without a dungeon master.\n\n*** GAMEMASTER TOOLS ***\n\nCustom Dungeons allow you to pick the CR level, environment (dungeon, cave, etc.) and enemy (orcs, undead, demons, etc.) and can generate a single level or multiple level dungeons.  \n\nYou can even email the map to yourself complete with a legend so that you can use the randomly generated dungeon offline or import into third-party software.\n\n*** CUSTOMIZE YOUR MAPS! ***\n\nAs a DM, you have a variety of tools to customize the maps.  This includes editing encounters, adding or deleting monsters, editing treasure, adding items, moving traps or setting custom messages for your players, which can allow you to add custom events or traps.\n\n*** MULTIPLE DUNGEON TYPES AND MULTI-LEVELS ***\n\nThe missions created by Endless RPG can encompass different types of 'dungeons' including caves, ruins, strongholds or the classic dungeon.  The missions can also be on a single level or multiple levels mixing and matching the dungeon types, so you can explore a cave that leads to ruins or a stronghold with a dungeon below it.\n\n*** EXPORT TO VIRTUAL TABLETOPS (ROLL20, ETC) OR FOR OFFLINE USE ***\n\nThe DM Mode allows you to email the map of the dungeon level, which can help when trying to use the dungeon in Roll20 or other virtual tabletops or simply playing offline.  You can email a legend with the map that will show all encounters, treasures, etc.  You can also view the map full screen in order to take a screenshot.\n\n*** QUICK BATTLE AND BATTLE MAPS FOR COMBAT MANAGEMENT***\n\nThe app aids in keeping track of hit points with characters on the screen while exploring.  When encountering creatures, the player has a choice of simply clearing the encounter (the monsters will be considered defeated), utilizing a Quick Combat mode, which is perfect on smartphones or for quick battles with 1 or 2 creatures, or a full Battle Map, which allows a more tactical way of resolving combat.\n\n*** SUPPORTS UP TO 8 CHARACTERS ***\n\nPlayers can run through the dungeon as a single character or a party of up to eight characters.  A \"character\" can also include guard dogs, guard bears, or other non-standard creatures.  \n\n*** EXPERIENCE AND LOOT TABLES ***\n\nThe app will keep track of the monsters you have killed, including the over experience points and experience points by character.  It will also track the treasure (magic items, coins, etc.) you have looted on your adventure.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nArt by Raymond E.

Adapted from the hugely successful books, the images are very interesting to babies, even if they seem simple to adults. Babies' vision is quite blurred for the first few weeks so strong contrasting shapes are the best. \n\nTake care to see how baby responds to the images. Lower the brightness and if baby tries to turn away, now might not be the best moment, so try later. New babies are all different, they can tire easily, but will still have favourites. Enjoy discovering which your babies likes with this great app."

      "label": "DeadBox is a Ghost Hunting App for communicating with spirits. It's similar to the Spirit Box and Ghost Box, you ask questions and look for intelligent and relevant responses to your questions. You should pick a location that is haunted, as ghosts need to be there to be able to respond. Be polite and treat with spirits with respect, as they were living people once, and being kind and friendly will increases your changes of them responding.\n\nThe Ghost Hunting App DeadBox has a built-in dictionary of words, which are picked at random. It is believed spirits and ghosts are able to manipulate electronic devices, and can override the app and pick words themselves. If you are getting random responses to your questions, there may be no spirits around at the time. Or they may not wish to communicate. Try again at another time or a different location. Just like when communicating with a Spirit Box or Ghost Box, think of engaging questions.\n\nDead Box is similar to the Ovilus and Paratek, but with a different and more relevant set of words. And we have given the app a creepy vibe and feel to help make your ghost hunting experience more exiting. There are no advertisements, no instore purchases, and your can change the scan speed. There is a history page so you can view previously picked words, it shows the date and time they were picked."

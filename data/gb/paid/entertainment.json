      "label": "This happy sound and music visualisation app converts sound frequencies into light/colour frequencies, in the most scientifically accurate visualisation process available on iOS. Will you find the aliens?\n\nSpecial Features:\n- Many geometries to explore the colour of your sounds\n- Mood light mode for music-responsive ambient light projection\n- Science page to learn more about our senses\n- Secret modes to unlock\n\nInstructions:\n1: The visualisation will begin immediately. Speak to your device or play music. Select different geometries with 2 fingers.\n2: Instructions are included in the app, you can access them any time with two fingers.\n\nThe art of synesthesia:\nAs trippy psychedelic synesthesia art, this app is an exploration of the relationship between our audio and visual senses, and the nature of our consciousness.\n\nThe science of the senses:\nYour eyes contain 3 colour receptive cells, each having different sensitivities within the perceptible light spectrum. At the same time, your ears have different sensitivities over the audible spectrum. In addition, our eyes and ears re-adjust depending on the intensity of light and sound. Using real data on the nature of our sensory organs, the ambient sound spectrum picked up by your device's microphone is converted into light in real-time, so you can for the first time see the colour of your voice, music, nature and environment.\n\n\nThis app forms part of a larger project of synesthesia and sound visualisation. For more information, apps and more details about the science involved, please visit the blog site:\nhttp://bensoundcolour.blogspot.jp/\nIf you would like to contribute music for a future release, or use this process in your own projects, live performances, VJ sets, or other, please send me an email."

In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science.

      "label": "LSW Collector is the most detailed LEGO Star Wars minifigure collecting app around and is the perfect way to catalogue your collection! Use the search bar to quickly find your minifigures by unique ID, name, or set number. You can swipe between minifigure entries to easily update your collection! Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes. You can also add multiple of the same minifigure to your collection and then track your total progress on the My Collection tab.\n\nLegal Information:\n\nLEGO and the minifigure are registered trademarks of the LEGO Group.\n\nSTAR WARS is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm, Ltd.

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

Frizzy hair, straight hair, blue hair…the choice is yours.\n  \nThe Drawing Badge\nSelect from different pens, pencils and paints to colour in the Squirrels - a pink and red Norrie with spots or a stripy Betty perhaps. When you’re happy with your drawing, watch with pride as Duggee displays your picture in the Clubhouse.\n \nThe Super Squirrel Badge\nDress up the Squirrels in an exciting range of heroic Super Squirrel outfits. Mix and match capes, masks, hats and more to style your Super Squirrel then watch them display their amazing costumes especially for you.\n \nThe Cake Badge\nThere’s lots of ingredients for you to add to your cake, so you’ll need to give it a good stir before Duggee pops it in the oven. The it’s time to decorate it with different coloured icing, sprinkles, fruit and more, present your cake to Duggee and the Squirrels so they can tuck in.\n \nThe Leaf Badge\nUsing your superb powers of detection, can you help the Squirrels spot the correct leaves to add to their collections. Explore different fully interactive scenes to try to find the special leaves and discover a few familiar faces along the way.\n\nThe Tinsel Badge\nChristmas is coming but the Clubhouse isn’t looking very Christmassy!

      "label": "From the brilliant idea and creation of Angelo Carbone, the app was developed by magician and developer Alessandro Albergo.\n\nIt’s back! After many years off the App Store.\nMagic SMS was first released back in 2011. Then Magic SMS 2 was released in 2015. Now here in 2022 we have Psychic Prediction.\n\nThis app is for entertainment purposes only.\n\n\"The best magic trick app that I've seen; beautifully thought through.\" - Derren Brown\n\n\"This is such a strong and effective use of magic on the iPhone. Finally!\" - David Blaine\n\n\"Magic SMS is the coolest effect I've seen in years! Trust me you'll be texting everyone about this. Amazing!\" - Dynamo\n\n\"Magic SMS represents a real leap forward in the development of iPhone magic. If you have an iPhone and like magic, you should buy it.\" - MAGIC Magazine Review\n\n* As performed live on London's LBC Radio and one of LBC Radio's Best Apps of the Year. *\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nImagine a magic app that does not look like you are running an app...\n\nImagine a magic app that creates powerful mind reading magic...\n\nIntroducing Magic SMS 2... Mind Reading via Text Message.\n\n\nThe Effect: You tell your friend that you know someone who is psychic and that you want to put him to the test. You ask your friend to freely think of any colour and any playing card. Nothing is spoken or written down.\n\nYou send a text message to your psychic asking him to guess what your friend is thinking of. You then turn off your phone and put it aside. From this point on you NEVER touch the phone AGAIN.\n\nYou both patiently wait for the text message to arrive. Moments later, an SMS does arrive. The preview message in the Lock Screen shows that it is indeed from the psychic. Now that the message has arrived you ask your friend for the first time to confirm what they had thought of.\n\nYou ask your friend to pick up the phone (as you don’t want to touch it) and to read the full reply. They will be utterly amazed to see that the psychic has correctly guessed both the freely thought of colour and playing card.\n\nWOW!\n\n\n• Easy to do but very POWERFUL in effect!\n• The FIRST EVER magic app to use this UNIQUE principle.\n• No voice activation, G-Sensor use, icon swiping or suspicious turning over of the phone.\n• No masking or hiding of the screen. Everything is done openly and fairly.\n• You NEVER touch the phone, once the text has been sent.\n• Once you know what colour and card your friend has thought of you STILL never touch the phone.\n• SMS reply can be customised to say whatever you want.\n• 9 routines plus new improvements from the original Magic SMS app.\n• A truly free choice of ANY colour and ANY playing card. A staggering 530 possible combinations.\n\n** SUPPORTED LANGUAGES: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish and Portuguese.**\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSUPPORT INFORMATION\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any issues, please contact magicsms@live.com or allab.developer@gmail.com before leaving a review and we will be happy to assist."

      "label": "In Tabula Mundi Tarot, the Fool’s Journey begins with a step into a wormhole, a rip in the fabric of space-time. Along the way, the Fool dances to the beat of the disc-jockey Magus, surfs with the Charioteer, and balances on a sword’s edge with figure-skating Adjustment.\n\nTabula Mundi Tarot is the work of The Rosetta Tarot’s creator, M. M. Meleen. Every card in Tabula Mundi Tarot remains faithful to the esoteric meaning of Aleister Crowley’s masterpiece, Thoth Tarot. However, Tabula Mundi is not at all a reworking of Lady Frieda Harris’ artworks for Thoth.\n\nTabula Mundi follows Thelemic philosophy and mirrors the structure of Thoth. Each card is painted according to the fourfold color scale developed by the adepts of the Golden Dawn, drawing on Alchemy, Astrology, and the Qabalah, often with an underlying sacred geometry grid.\n\nAs the Fool steps into the wormhole, he meets these modern interpretations of the Thoth archetypes, a vivid panorama of cognitive imagery. The Fool encounters the whole of creation with art that speaks to our time. Here are new inspiring images of the universal Tree of Life, updated for the discerning 21st century occultist.\n\n*Intuitive, elegant interface is easy for beginners and experts\n*Gorgeous full screen, high-resolution card images\n*Full support for all current iOS devices\n*Sophisticated journal\n*Includes full and unabridged book\n*20 spreads built in\n*Design your own layout with Free Form\n*Allow reversed cards or not\n*Option to use Major Arcana only\n*Zoom in to enlarge card details\n*Share reading via e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter\n*Animated shuffle & cut\n*Optional voice prompts\n*Customize with your own card meanings & reading cloths\n*Many adjustable settings\n*Book and card meanings available in English only\n\nHold the universe in your hands, with Tabula Mundi Tarot."

From design to execution, his apps are absolutely flawless. \nInertia Pro is a prime example of why I trust in his work so implicitly, it is jaw droppingly good and represents one of the most cutting-edge mentalism releases to date!”\n- Michael Murray\n\n\nPLUS - If you have Xeno, you can now create your own sites for use with Inertia Pro, or use any of the Xeno Sites available in the gallery.\n\nAnd... you can perform Inertia Pro with any Xeno site REMOTELY! This can all happen on the spectator's device, without you touching it.\nPerfect for Zoom shows or long-distance performances!\n\n\nThe Jerx wrote this about Inertia Pro:\n\n“You know those phone forces where you would hold the phone upside down and have them scroll blindly and whatever picture or item they landed on would be forced (usually because their scrolling wasn’t doing anything)?\n\nWell, this app allows you to do that type of force face-up while the spectator looks at the phone.\n\nIt’s so good and *feels* exactly like it should.”\n\n\n--- \n\nInertia is for entertainment purposes only, designed for professional performers. This app does not provide true mind reading abilities or anything similar.\n\nPlease get in touch to discuss TV or video performance rights."

      "label": "This Living Worlds app is a modern recreation of a set of dynamic pixel art scenes first published in the early 90s as part of an \"illustrated personal organizer\" named Seize the Day, and seen as screenshots across the Internet since then. These scenes were created by Mark Ferrari, legendary artist from such classic games as Loom and The Secret of Monkey Island as well as the recent Thimbleweed Park. Now, 25 years later, Ian Gilman, the original software developer, has resurrected the Living Worlds, with Mark's support and additional code from Joseph Huckaby. There may be copycats, but this is the only authentic version from the original creators! \n\nThis release of the app contains all twelve of the original scenes in their full glory. The sun rises and falls in real time, storms pass through, flowers bloom, the moon and stars cross the sky. Smaller details like chimney smoke and animal footprints come and go. The image \"lives\" throughout the day, drawing you in, suggesting stories, and rewarding quiet observation.\n\nIn addition to the classic graphics, each scene includes a new \"Logbook\" story written by Mark Ferrari and ambient soundscapes designed by Ian Gilman.\n\nJoin us for this 25th anniversary celebration of these unique artworks!"

      "label": "Light Creations allows you to create amazing light sculptures and structures. You provide the seed for the creation by drawing an arbitrary line, e.g., straight, curved, or long and winded, and enjoy how Light Creations transforms this seed into a dynamic piece of 3D art.\n\nAccelerate the animation by humming, singing or playing music and dive deep into a relaxing journey through a world of light.\n\nObserve the mesmerizing dynamics of the evolving art and create screenshots with ease just by tapping an icon. The screenshots are conveniently saved into your photo album for further processing and sharing. \n\nLight Creations provides five themes, each transforming the initial seed in a different way:\n\nGalaxy - Creates light sculptures built out of many light particles.\n\nLight Ocean - Creates light sculptures above an ocean of light.\n\nCentered Lines - Creates symmetrical light structures.\n\nWarped Lines - Creates a work of art where the initial seed is warped in space resulting in fractal like creations.\n\nMultiDraw - The initial line is mirrored several times and warped in space already while drawing. Tip: use the pinch gesture to emphasize the amazing micro and macro structures.\n\n- Universal App for iPad, iPhone, iPod.\n- Retina Display support.\n- There are no ads or in-app purchases in Light Creations.\n\nCustomer Comments:\n\n***** Wow!!!!\n\"This is the most beautiful and trippy app I have on my iPad (and I have about 20). Listen to some ambient electronica or psychedelia and ascend to a higher plain without chemical assistance.\"\n\n***** AWESOME!\n\"Love it, mesmerizing & beautiful ! Save your creations & share. Recommend,\"\n\n***** Great app for creative control\n\"I typically don't write reviews, but these visuals need a voice! They are simply in a league of their own. The future of intuitive easy to use visuals has arrived! [...] Congratulations to the developer for this marvelous work of art! \"\n\n***** Totally brilliant\n\"This is like having your own personal firework display. Congrats to the app maker.\"\n\n***** Grandiose"

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

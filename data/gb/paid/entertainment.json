      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

Ghost SLS works as an SLS Emulator to so you can get results without buying an expensive camera.\n\nThe camera filters allow you to determine if the figure detected could be due to the lighting conditions of the area so you can spot false positives.\n\nBecause this is not a true SLS camera your results in low light may be less reliable.  Because of this it is recommended that you turn on your camera's torch light if you are scanning in dark areas.\n\nYou can also snap photos of what you catch to share with your friends or other investigators.\n\nJoin our group chat to discuss ghostly things with other users.\n\nIf things get a little spooky we recommend turning on some lights and taking a break from the app for a while. :)"

      "label": "This is the Original \"Spider on Hand\" app as seen on Youtube. Beware of imitations.\n\nDo you know anyone who is afraid of spiders? Everyone right? Then this is the perfect magic trick/prank for you.\n\nWatch the trailer video at http://www.mypetboris.com/trailer.htm\n\nMy Pet Boris app is the scariest app for the iPhone. Inspired by Jim Pace's magic trick \"The Web\" where a spider magically appears on the back of your spectator's hand. Bound to get amazing reactions.\n\nThe app uses the idea of \"Augmented Reality\" merging real life objects with computer generated graphics to create a truly frightening effect.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC SPIDER EFFFECT\nYou take a photo of the spectator's palm (secretly loading a plastic spider on the back of their hand) and place the phone on their palm to hold.\n\nYour Pet Boris - an Australian Red back spider (black widow) creeps onto the screen and they can feel the vibrations as it walks. You can tap the screen and even slide your finger into the animation to scratch the spider's back. Boris walks off the screen.\n\nYou tell them that the phone has special sensors that when you wave your hand over the screen it makes the spider come back. He does.\n\nYou get them to wave their hand over the phone. \nIt is just then that they glimpse a realistic spider clinging to the back of their hand and they FREAK OUT!!\n\nBound to get BIG reactions. \n\nFinger tone and size can be set to suit your own or you can import an image of your own finger. \n\nStart-up screen can be customised to suit your performance style. An actual  photo of their hand, solid white or any image from your library can be used as a background.\n\nNOTE: Requires a plastic spider or cockroach and adhesive dots to perform. You should be able to find these locally or you can purchase from our website.\n\nSee our website http://www.mypetboris.com for more details, spider and cockroach supplies and video presentation & instructions.\n\nLike our Facebook page to keep up to date with changes, tips and suggestions. http://www.facebook.com/MyPetBoris\n\n\nTHE MAGIC COCKROACH\nThe app also comes with a cockroach animation for those who think they are scarier than spiders.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC BUTTERFLY EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Butterfly is an additional effect within the Magic Spider – My Pet Boris App. \n\nIt is enabled as an “in app purchase” for around US$2.99 depending on your local currency. The custom finger feature is also unlocked when you purchase the butterfly effect.\n \nThis is a perfect routine for those times when you want to perform a beautiful effect for a little girl or woman, leaving her with a magical gift at the end. You will get similarly strong reactions to the Magic Spider effect without the scare factor.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe magician simulates a grand illusion in the palm of the spectator’s hand. A tiny foil covered “Magical Egg” is placed in the palm of the spectator’s hand and then photographed. The phone is placed on their hand.\n\nThe egg transforms into a Chrysalis and then into a butterfly. The magician’s finger is seen to tickle the virtual butterfly on screen which then flies away. \nUsing a magical gesture the magician brings the butterfly back briefly before it flies off again.\n\nThe spectator is asked to try and make it return. When they try, they find a matching butterfly (in an impossible location) on the back of their hand. The original foil egg has vanished.\n\nTHE CARD REVELATION EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Spider effect with the addition of a torn card corner revelation as a finale.\n\nAccessory packs and supplies are available at: http://www.mypetboris.com/store.htm\n\nSee our FAQ Section. http://www.mypetboris.com/faq.htm\n\nFull instructions at: (everything is explained)\nhttp://www.mypetboris.com/inst2099.htm.\n\nUse the password at the bottom of the \"CREDITS\" screen for access."

Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science. While the periodic table in Toca Lab: Elements is accurate, the way new elements are created is not. Instead, it’s a fun way to experiment, discover and create curiosity in the world of science. Toca Lab: Elements is just a starting point for further exploration! \n\n***\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

Open the app, find the channels list, look for the channel you want to watch and then press play. TV Launcher takes away that pain by allowing you to open any of the supported streaming apps directly to the channel.\n\n\nTV Launcher contains these great features:\n\nUK STREAMING PLATFORMS\n\nTV Launcher supports all of the main UK streaming platforms that have live TV and a few more too! You’ll be able to jump straight to channels in BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, My5, NOW (Sky), Discovery+, TalkTV, euronews, France 24, Al Jazeera and Bloomberg. There's also support for quick access to UKTV Play, Pluto TV, DAZN, STV Player and RTÉ Player as well which unfortunately don't support launching channels fully.\n\n\nWIDGETS & SHORTCUTS\n\nYou don’t even have to open TV Launcher to get to the channel you want to watch. With the Widget, you can launch channels directly from your Home Screen and support for Siri Shortcuts means you can watch channels using just your voice!\n\n\nTV GUIDE\n\nChoose to see what's on now and up next or, view a full day's worth of listing so you can decide what to watch before choosing a channel.\n\n\nFAVOURITES\n\nIf you have a select few channels you always like to watch, add them to your favourites list.\n\n\nHIDE CHANNELS\n\nNot interested in the news or don’t have kids? Choose the channels you want to hide and only keep around the ones you’re likely to watch. If you don’t have a streaming app installed, you can hide channels from those too.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNCING\n\nYour favourite channels, hidden channels and other settings all sync via iCloud so if you have multiple devices using TV Launcher, they'll all be kept in sync.\n\n\nREGION\n\nDifferent parts of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland & Northern Ireland) have slight variations to their standard channels. Choose your region in the settings menu and you’ll be shown the channels you expect.\n\n\nORGANISATION\n\nTV Launcher supports many layout configurations so you can organise your channels exactly how you’d like to find them. There’s options like a full list, grouping by app or even by category too.\n\n\nCUSTOMISATION\n\nOnce you’ve organised your channels, choose how to display them with options like the ability to show channel names or group names.\n\n\nSEARCH\n\nIf you can’t find the channel you’re looking for, search for it!\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: support@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note that to watch a selected channel, you will need the respective app installed. TV Launcher cannot be guaranteed to work outside the UK due to the selection of apps available in specific countries. All channels and their respective trademarks are owned by them and this app is not affiliated with them in any way."

Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off.

Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes.

Select a keyword / phrase you want to change from the web page, when it disappears or changes, the browser will stop refreshing and sound an Alarm!.\n\nThe Browser Features:\n-Refresh until word or phrase no longer appears on the page (this means you are no longer stuck on the holding page)\n-Auto Detect if page failed to load.\n-Prevent the iPhone or iPad going to sleep\n-Two search methods \n-Refresh until word Appears \n-Refresh until word Disappears / changes\n-Change the refresh speed.\nExample uses:\n- Sales sites: Get an advantage with sneaker sales, new exclusive phone sales and clothing sales.  Sometimes you need to keep refreshing a website just before a sale starts, choose a keyword or phrase like ‘currently unavailable’ and the app will keep refreshing until the word disappears, i.e the sale is on. This can give you the vital seconds required to purchase / cop that exclusive sales item.  \n\n- Ticketing sites: will often keep you in a queue on a web page known as a ‘holding page’, on some sites refreshing this page can get you through to the purchase page. This is where The Refreshinator helps, More refreshes = More chances of a ticket. When you are stuck on a \"holding page\", The Refreshinator can be set to automatically refresh the holding page until you get onto the purchase area. As each refresh is a chance, the speed you refresh the page counts Increases your chances. The Refreshinator can do this faster than a person and can drastically improve your chances of getting through a ticket queue. The App was used to purchase tickets in the Glastonbury ticket sale and Glastonbury Resale, it get through to the purchase area over ten times in an average of 30 seconds. Once in 3 seconds.\n\n- Chat rooms / sports sites:  Some sites do not refresh when updates occur, you can set the Refreshinator to Refresh a site until a a game finishes or a chat group updates, in these scenarios we recommend using a a refresh rate of 5 - 15 seconds as updates are not so frequent.\n\n- Job listings, some site put up job listing at a given point of time however watching and refreshing the site continuously is a chore. Just put in the key word or phrase and set the app to keep refreshing until the listing appears."

When Bomb Jacke is jumping if tap Bomb Jacke glides in the air.\n\nThe Game\n-------------\n\nThe player controls Bomb Jacke, a superhero mighty mouse who can leap and glide. Someone has planted 24 bombs at landscapes. Bomb Jacke must fly around the screen to collect the bombs. Each screen uses a different configuration of platforms upon which Bomb Jacke may run and jump. Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty.\n\nBomb Jacke \"defuses\" the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb's fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching 20 or more bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Bomb Jacke may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game's bonuses and power-ups. The lit fuses have no strategic purpose other than the bonus; a lit bomb left unattended does not explode.\n\nYou control Bomb Jacke throughout the game. Bomb Jacke one and only mission is to collect all of the bombs in the stage before moving on to the next and collecting more. In his way will be several enemies which will seek to stop him. Bomb Jacke will lose one life any time he comes into contact with any of the enemies. There is no time limit, so Bomb Jacke can take as long as he needs to clear the stage. However, the longer you wait, the more likely it is that the enemies will overwhelm him. Bomb Jacke can turn the tables on his enemies by collecting a power coin (P), which will temporarily turn all of the enemies into coins which he can collect. Whether Bomb Jacke earns extra lives by reaching certain coins.\n\nPower Coin (P), Obtainable after meter filling the Bonus Multiplier 20 segments: unlit bombs by 1, and lit bombs by 2.\n\nBonus Coin (B), Obtainable every time the score reaches a multiple of 5,000, until the Bonus Multiplier reaches x5 per level.\n\nExtra Coin (E), Obtainable when Bomb Jacke has \"killed\" enough enemies by collecting them as Coins, and score reaches multiple of 50,000.\n\nEnjoy it!!!!"

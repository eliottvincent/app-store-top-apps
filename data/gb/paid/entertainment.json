      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science.

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

      "label": "Get ready to rescue baby dinosaurs with Blaze and AJ in Blaze’s Dinosaur Egg Rescue Game!  \n\nThis iPhone app exposes preschoolers to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) concepts as they travel through Dino Valley with Blaze and AJ to find lost dinosaur eggs.\n\nThroughout the adventure, children are encouraged to develop problem-solving strategies and complete physics-based puzzles using water, bouncy balls and lasers to rescue dinosaur eggs from dangerous situations. Each location contains between one to three eggs, along with a hidden prehistoric gem!\n\nTOOLS: To rescue the dinosaur eggs, children are encouraged to manipulate the following tools and simple machines:\n-\tWheels\n-\tPulleys\n-\tCranks\n-\tLevers\n-\tMirrors (static and rotating)\n-\tSolar panels\n-\tPendulums\n\nCONCEPTS: In addition to experimenting with different tools, children are exposed to the following STEM concepts:\n-\tHeight (e.g. moving Blaze up or down to reach certain locations)\n-\tWeight (e.g. adding objects to a  bucket connected to a pulley)\n-\tTrajectory (e.g. manipulating the path of water, bouncy balls or a laser)\n-\tAdhesion (e.g. using a “sticky patch” to trap items and construct a path to complete the puzzle)\n\nHANDS-ON APPROACH TO LEARNING\nThis educational iPhone game for kids fosters a hands-on, experiential approach to STEM learning through critical-thinking challenges that enhance children’s understanding of physics puzzles and how things work. Kids learn with the help of their best friend Blaze - the coolest truck from the popular Nick Jr TV show!\n\nADDITIONAL GAME FEATURES\n-\t3 Blaze transformations – Blaze can shoot water, bouncy balls, or laser beams!\n-\tExplore three locations in Dino Valley and navigate different types of terrain – the jungle, rocky plateaus and a volcano!\n-\t45 levels – Solve forty-five physics puzzles to locate over 80 dinosaur eggs and a prehistoric gem on every level! \n\n\nBlaze and the Monster Machines Dinosaur Rescue collects personal user data as well as non-personal user data (including aggregated data).

The philosophy is not about winning, losing or competition, it's about having fun in a child-friendly environment and learning without even realizing it! Great Mini-Games with purpose!:\n\nCompatibility: The App doesn't support iPad2, iPhone 4s, iPad Mini1, iPod5 with iOS9\n\n1) Kitten Hide&Seek - encourages focus and attention.\n2) Paw Painting - creativity unleashed! Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children. Parents have the option to limit screen time for their kids: after a chosen time, the kitten gets tired and goes to sleep.\nLittle Kitten is a high-tech app - using the latest 3d animation technology to create the visuals, it also uses cutting edge programming to maximize the user experience on your apple device. Enjoy the premium quality content in this original app brought to you by Squeakosaurus.

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

Use the search bar to quickly find your minifigures by unique ID, name, or set number. You can swipe between minifigure entries to easily update your collection! Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes. You can also add multiple of the same minifigure to your collection and then track your total progress on the My Collection tab.\n\nLegal Information:\n\nLEGO and the minifigure are registered trademarks of the LEGO Group.\n\nSTAR WARS is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm, Ltd.

      "label": "DeadBox is a Ghost Hunting App for communicating with spirits. It's similar to the Spirit Box and Ghost Box, you ask questions and look for intelligent and relevant responses to your questions. You should pick a location that is haunted, as ghosts need to be there to be able to respond. Be polite and treat with spirits with respect, as they were living people once, and being kind and friendly will increases your changes of them responding.\n\nThe Ghost Hunting App DeadBox has a built-in dictionary of words, which are picked at random. It is believed spirits and ghosts are able to manipulate electronic devices, and can override the app and pick words themselves. If you are getting random responses to your questions, there may be no spirits around at the time. Or they may not wish to communicate. Try again at another time or a different location. Just like when communicating with a Spirit Box or Ghost Box, think of engaging questions.\n\nDead Box is similar to the Ovilus and Paratek, but with a different and more relevant set of words. And we have given the app a creepy vibe and feel to help make your ghost hunting experience more exiting. There are no advertisements, no instore purchases, and your can change the scan speed. There is a history page so you can view previously picked words, it shows the date and time they were picked."

It’s Duggee Time!\n\nSafe, trusted, ad-free fun for your little ones.\n \nJoin Duggee and the Squirrels at the Clubhouse as they work hard to earn their badges: Re-style Duggee's crazy hair; bring out your inner artist and colour in your favourite Squirrel; dress up each of the squirrels in their heroic Super Squirrel costumes; put your chef's hat on and bake a cake with Duggee; turn super-sleuth as you hunt for an outstanding leaf collection; get Christmassy and decorate a tree with Duggee. \n \nKey Features:\n•\tExplore the Squirrel Club and interact with all your favourite characters across 6 fun games\n• \tCollect six badges for each of the Squirrels – but make sure you leave time for a Duggee Hug!\n• \tVisit your gallery to see a Polaroid of all your wonderful game creations \n \nGames:\n \nThe Hair Badge\nCut, colour and style Duggee’s hair any way you want, using lots of different tools – a brush, scissors, colour dye and even hair growth cream for when you snip off too much. Frizzy hair, straight hair, blue hair…the choice is yours.\n  \nThe Drawing Badge\nSelect from different pens, pencils and paints to colour in the Squirrels - a pink and red Norrie with spots or a stripy Betty perhaps. When you’re happy with your drawing, watch with pride as Duggee displays your picture in the Clubhouse.\n \nThe Super Squirrel Badge\nDress up the Squirrels in an exciting range of heroic Super Squirrel outfits. Mix and match capes, masks, hats and more to style your Super Squirrel then watch them display their amazing costumes especially for you.\n \nThe Cake Badge\nThere’s lots of ingredients for you to add to your cake, so you’ll need to give it a good stir before Duggee pops it in the oven. The it’s time to decorate it with different coloured icing, sprinkles, fruit and more, present your cake to Duggee and the Squirrels so they can tuck in.\n \nThe Leaf Badge\nUsing your superb powers of detection, can you help the Squirrels spot the correct leaves to add to their collections. Explore different fully interactive scenes to try to find the special leaves and discover a few familiar faces along the way.\n\nThe Tinsel Badge\nChristmas is coming but the Clubhouse isn’t looking very Christmassy!

Throttle, tire skidding, and gear shifting all matched automatically to your driving using iPhone’s motion sensors. Compatible with all boards, no additional hardware is needed.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n• Start HoverBoard Engine and turn iPhone asleep into your pocket\n• Step onto your hoverboard\n• Tap your iPhone/pocket to start the engine\n• Go ride on your board! iPhone’s motion sensors detect your speed\n• HoverBoard Engine creates matching throttle, break, gear shift and tire skidding sounds!\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n• Choose between a growling V4, a singing V6 and a massive gasoline gobbling V8 with rattling valves\n• Manual mode that allows you to play with the engines by hand, without hoverboard, while seeing the cylinders rev up\n• After your ride you can export/save your engine sounds, e.g. to use them in a hover-action movie\n\nIdeal for use with bluetooth-audio hoverboards, so the sounds really come from the board. With normal, non-audio boards, the iPhone’s powerful internal speaker can be used. ALERT: this is so much fun that “silent” hoverboarding becomes hoverboring! Remember to always drive safely, and keep your iPhone securely in your pocket while driving.\n\nEnjoy the ride!\n\nAndré\nrodotti.com"

Roleplay, lyrics, jokes, memes - all sorts!\n\nEndless variety and hilarious replies mean people keep chatting for hours. It talks the way you do - or maybe the way you most want it to. \n\nEmail fun conversations to your friends or share them through your Facebook or Twitter. Stop and start talking on multiple conversations whenever you like.\n\nThis app is uniquely designed for the iPhone, with chat bubbles scrolling by. Change their shade to suit your mood.\n\nYou need to be online to talk - the app has to communicate with servers - but even slow connections are fine.\n\nThe keyboard in the screenshots is Tyyyp, which uses Cleverbot AI, and works well with the Cleverbot app!\n\nFor an app with an emotional avatar too, and with iPad support, check out Cleverbot HD. \n\n\n\nThis app has reached the top 50 overall in the US and has remained mostly inside the top 20 Entertainment for over 18 months.\n\n***Over 2000 5 star ratings worldwide.***\n\nNot only that, our feedback is GREAT too...!\n\n\"To all the Luddites who claim computers can never replace human interaction you guys flip a defiant bird.\" 25th Sept 2013\n\n\"I can't believe I'm not talking to an actual person, it seems so real. Great work.\" 8th Sept 2013\n\n\"Super excellent. I am very much excited, entertained, interested\" 1st March 2013\n\n\"Omg !!! Its so amazing!!! Now its my new BFF :p\" 25th Oct 2011\n\n\"Seriously this may be the coolest thing anyone has ever developed. I salute you.\" 25th Aug 2011\n\n\"Truly Amazing - I just had like an hours chat with it. It is amazing it's like a pocket best friend. It's so totally awesome and is so cool I can't believe it's this cheap.\" 21st Mar 2011\n\n\"Cleverbot is epic!!!!!!!!!! He's there when I want to talk about dolphins, There when I want to ask him where babies come from, I am glad I found him. He talks about anything. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. Thank god you made this.\" 30th Jan 2011\n\n\"After about one day with this I found the bot will role-play with you and had a blast! After a few *slaps* I found it can fight. You can live out movie fight scenes WITH AN AI! Then it started doing things I didn't know it could do... like *kisses hard* or *hurls you into fan*... yep it gets intense. No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

And i can refuse to give rides to deadbeats at work if the geiger counter detects radiation on their shoes.\" - Callagene (Canada App Store\n\n\"***** Eccellente\" - Lucasteno (Italy App Store)\n\n\"Valutazione **** Semplice ed ottimo strumento di rilevazione Buono\" -  Ermanred (Italy App Store)\n\nFEATURES\n\n• easy-to-read LCD display measures spurious hazards from background to extreme levels\n• oversized numeric meter easily switchable from microsieverts to millirem or count per minute scales\n• realistic digital counter from 0.10 μSv/h to 100 μSv/h (0.01 mrem/h to 10 mrem/h)\n• authentic audio click rate, easily mutable for library or classroom use\n• versatile alpha, beta, and gamma modes\n• dual tilt-sensitive and touch-sensitive controls\n•  audio synchronized iPhone camera flash adds to the tension\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Hold Digital Geiger Counter flat and face up.\n\n2. Smoothly tilt Digital Geiger Counter's face to the left or right on the x-axis to increase levels.\n\n3. Surreptitiously touch and hold the yellowish radiation symbol on the bottom left of the screen with your thumb to boost levels if necessary. The outside circle edge gives minimal boost, slowly increasing to maximum boost in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.\n\n4. For best results with Digital Geiger Counter, practice subtly combining both tilt and touch control methods. Also try twisting Digital Geiger Counter as you move it towards your target. Be slow and smooth.\n\nWARNING\n\nDigital Geiger Counter is meant for entertainment purposes only and is entirely ineffective at detecting actual ionizing radiation. Digital Geiger Counter is factory-calibrated to the x-axis and contains no user-serviceable parts."

After many years off the App Store.\nMagic SMS was first released back in 2011. Then Magic SMS 2 was released in 2015. Now here in 2022 we have Psychic Prediction.\n\nThis app is for entertainment purposes only.\n\n\"The best magic trick app that I've seen; beautifully thought through.\" - Derren Brown\n\n\"This is such a strong and effective use of magic on the iPhone. Finally!\" - David Blaine\n\n\"Magic SMS is the coolest effect I've seen in years! Trust me you'll be texting everyone about this. Amazing!\" - Dynamo\n\n\"Magic SMS represents a real leap forward in the development of iPhone magic. If you have an iPhone and like magic, you should buy it.\" - MAGIC Magazine Review\n\n* As performed live on London's LBC Radio and one of LBC Radio's Best Apps of the Year. *\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nImagine a magic app that does not look like you are running an app...\n\nImagine a magic app that creates powerful mind reading magic...\n\nIntroducing Magic SMS 2... Mind Reading via Text Message.\n\n\nThe Effect: You tell your friend that you know someone who is psychic and that you want to put him to the test. You ask your friend to freely think of any colour and any playing card. Nothing is spoken or written down.\n\nYou send a text message to your psychic asking him to guess what your friend is thinking of. You then turn off your phone and put it aside. From this point on you NEVER touch the phone AGAIN.\n\nYou both patiently wait for the text message to arrive. Moments later, an SMS does arrive. The preview message in the Lock Screen shows that it is indeed from the psychic. Now that the message has arrived you ask your friend for the first time to confirm what they had thought of.\n\nYou ask your friend to pick up the phone (as you don’t want to touch it) and to read the full reply. They will be utterly amazed to see that the psychic has correctly guessed both the freely thought of colour and playing card.\n\nWOW!\n\n\n• Easy to do but very POWERFUL in effect!\n• The FIRST EVER magic app to use this UNIQUE principle.\n• No voice activation, G-Sensor use, icon swiping or suspicious turning over of the phone.\n• No masking or hiding of the screen. Everything is done openly and fairly.\n• You NEVER touch the phone, once the text has been sent.\n• Once you know what colour and card your friend has thought of you STILL never touch the phone.\n• SMS reply can be customised to say whatever you want.\n• 9 routines plus new improvements from the original Magic SMS app.\n• A truly free choice of ANY colour and ANY playing card. A staggering 530 possible combinations.\n\n** SUPPORTED LANGUAGES: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish and Portuguese.**\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSUPPORT INFORMATION\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any issues, please contact magicsms@live.com or allab.developer@gmail.com before leaving a review and we will be happy to assist."

The spectator  just by looking at a slideshow and you can guess or force several images in the same performance while you have your back to the audience.    “ True mentalism”\n\n—NO INTERNET connection needed.\n—Intuitive and super easy to learn and perform.\n—Fully customizable, create your own photo album and share it with other users. \n\nImpossible right? what the spectator  doesn't know and will never suspect is that while watching a slideshow from the iphone photo gallery, Photopsia app is analyzing their face, detecting when the spectator closes or opens their eyes, ruling out blinking. \n\n\n\"Phenomenal magic app with lots of potentials, using mindblowing technology.\" - Benke Smith \n\n“Never thought that something like that is possible… PHOTOPSIA broke all the limits”  alexandru miclea ( administrator group facebook magic apps)\n\n“A wicked clever app with ingenious input methods that will blow people’s minds. \nFirst impressions.. Just amazing!! “ - Shameer Salim\n\n\nHere are some features where you can create your own routines:\n\nForced feature\nWith this feature you will be able to force one or several items (image). In the case of not adding any image as force, you will only be able to do the peek. ( guessing the last image the spectator saw by closing their eyes to focus on the details of that image)\n\nWhen the spectator closes his eyes Photopsia app recognizes the image that is displayed just at the moment of closing his eyes.\n\nWhen the Spectator opens his eyes, the image selected in the settings will be shown as forced, this can be repeated with one or more images from the same album and even without leaving the performance, choose another album to perform the same or another effect.\n\nMatch force feature\n\nIt is often used as a match between two spectator\n\nFirst spectator select freely an item (when eyes close) to automatically become the force item when the second spectator ( parnet) open the eye.\n\nDual Force\n It allows you to force an item depending on the item chosen freely by one spectator\n\nEach image (item) is paired with another, depending on the one the spectator chooses freely when closing his eyes, when the spectator opens them ,the first image he will see will be the forced image that is paired with the chosen one freely when he closes his eye before"

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

Open the app, find the channels list, look for the channel you want to watch and then press play. TV Launcher takes away that pain by allowing you to open any of the supported streaming apps directly to the channel.\n\n\nTV Launcher contains these great features:\n\nUS STREAMING PLATFORMS\n\nTV Launcher supports many US streaming platforms that have live TV! You’ll be able to jump straight to channels in CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX NOW, Discovery+, FXNOW, Pluto TV, TNT, TBS, Nat Geo TV, CNN, Bloomberg, DisneyNOW, ESPN and NBA.\n\n\nWIDGETS & SHORTCUTS\n\nYou don’t even have to open TV Launcher to get to the channel you want to watch. With the Widget, you can launch channels directly from your Home Screen and support for Siri Shortcuts means you can watch channels using just your voice!\n\n\nTV GUIDE\n\nChoose to see what's on now and up next or, view a full day's worth of listings so you can decide what to watch before choosing a channel.\n\n\nFAVORITES\n\nIf you have a select few channels you always like to watch, add them to your favorites list.\n\n\nHIDE CHANNELS\n\nNot interested in the news or don’t have kids? Choose the channels you want to hide and only keep around the ones you’re likely to watch. If you don’t have a streaming app installed, you can hide channels from those too.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNCING\n\nYour favorite channels, hidden channels and other settings all sync via iCloud so if you have multiple devices using TV Launcher, they'll all be kept in sync.\n\n\nREGION\n\nChoose from East or West so you get shown the channels you expect.\n\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nTV Launcher supports many layout configurations so you can organise your channels exactly how you’d like to find them. There’s options like a full list, grouping by app or even by category too.\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\n\nOnce you’ve organized your channels, choose how to display them with options like the ability to show channel names or group names.\n\n\nSEARCH\n\nIf you can’t find the channel you’re looking for, search for it!\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: support@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note that to watch a selected channel, you will need the respective app installed. TV Launcher cannot be guaranteed to work outside the US due to the selection of apps available in specific countries.

And add the Christmas decorations you want to see such as Christmas cards, balls, bows, stockings, and Christmas lights. You can add also a Christmas Tree widget on your home screen and notification panel.

That is built for iPhone, iPhone Pro, iPad, iPad Air, iPad Mini, and iPad Pro. And it is the ideal entertainment tool to enjoy the Christmas season at home and anywhere in the world. Merry Christmas!\n\nWhen it is just the 12 days of Christmas, or you are more than 60 days early. You will be notified on many days is left. In the small widget, you will see it on the top right of your widget. And for the medium widget, at the right of your Christmas tree, you see the countdown to when it is Christmas.\n\nWhat is Christmas?\nChristmas was traditionally a Christian festival celebrating the birth of Jesus, but in the early 20th century, it also became a secular family holiday, observed by Christians and non-Christians alike. The secular holiday is often devoid of Christian elements, with the mythical figure Santa Claus playing the pivotal role. That lives in the winter wonderland in the North Pole.\n\nWhy Christmas is celebrated?\nChristmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.\n\nThe unique features in this high-quality app:\n◆ Change the tree type in the app and widget\n◆ Change the tree blinking light color\n◆ Change the color of the bows\n◆ Change the color of the stockings\n◆ Option to change the widget background to solid, gradient, image, or transparent\n◆ Option to show you the days left until Christmas day (with the option to count to 24 or 25 December)\n\nYour Christmas Countdown is ready to go. Now we must wait and sing this song. Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way...\n\nProject information:\nhttps://www.stefanvd.net/project/my-christmas-tree\n\nThis is built by the developer of the most popular browser extension Turn Off the Lights.

It also rolls a six-sided die (and doesn't cheat). But best of all . . . once per game, you get a Boon . . . an in-game advantage to help you kill the monsters, steal the treasure, and stab your buddy. There are almost 150 different Boons, all illustrated by John Kovalic. The higher your level when you ask for your Boon, the better it's likely to be. And when you reach the winning level, it plays a fanfare. Your friends will hate you . . .\n\nBonus features include:\n• Kill-O-Meter screen to keep track of combat scores.\n• Counters for Chez Geek and SPANC (Space Pirate Amazon Ninja Catgirls) illustrated with art from the games.\n\nThis app is NOT a stand-alone game! It is a game aid for the Munchkin card games and Munchkin Quest board games by Steve Jackson Games. Munchkin is the dungeon experience . . . with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff.

      "label": "This is a straightforward yet powerful app that acts as a polyphonic audio synthesizer with a virtually unlimited collection of sounds. Under the hood, It uses an AVAudioUnitSampler to generate the audio output when you touch one or more keys. The sounds that are available come from soundfont (SF2)  files, such as those available online for free (and of variable quality). \n\nThe app also exists as an AUv3 plug-in (included) so you can use it in your favorite music generation application such as GarageBand, Logic, or AUM. It also includes two AUv3 effects units – reverb and delay - which you can use separately as well..\n\nThe app supports MIDI input -- just connect a MIDI keyboard/controller to your iOS device and you should be good to go! There is also support for MIDI over Bluetooth.\n\nTo use, simply select a SoundFont name in the left list, then a patch name on the right and start playing. Some additional hints to get going:\n\n• Add a SoundFont (SF2) file that you have downloaded onto your iCloud Drive. Press the \"+\" button and then locate the file to add. You can always change the display name of the SoundFont  by swiping right. And you can remove a SoundFont that you no longer want by swiping left on its name.\n\n• Bring up reverb and delay effects by touching the wavy \"signal\" button.\n\n• Swipe right on a patch name to make it a favorite. Favorited patches have a star next to their name. You can edit the name of the favorite by again swiping right and selecting the edit action. You can remove a favorite by swiping left and selecting the remove action.\n\n• Touch the labels at either end of the black bar to change the range of the keyboard. You can go as low as \"C0\" and as high as \"C9\". You can also change the range by swiping left/right on the black bar. Note that this ability does not exist in the AUv3 extension -- use the native application keyboard controls to achieve the same results. You can also toggle the keyboard sliding feature by touching the small arrow between the note labels.\n\n• Switch between the soundfont patches listing and the favorites view by double-tapping on the patch name in the black bar above the keyboard. You can also swipe left/right with two fingers in the patches and favorites views to switch to the other view.\n\n• In the view of favorites, you can edit a favorite button by double-tapping on it. You can rearrange the favorite buttons with a tap-and-hold gesture.\n\nFinally, you can check out the source code! Go to the Support URL to find out more."

Be Alfalfa, try the “Friar” effect for a more \"holy\" look or even add a birthmark to your chrome dome for a truly iconic bald style. \n\nFully animated, your hairless-self will even smile, blink, yawn and more. Make yourself, friends and family bald, then send them a video/photo of their comb-over via Skype, Viber, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, MMS, YouTube, Email, Gmail, and more.\n\nEven combine Old + Beard + Fat effects when you also have Oldify, Beardify or Fatify installed on your device!\n\nMAKE BALD FRIENDS!\nIt's hilarious :)\n\nJoin us: @apptly on Instagram / Twitter\n\n\nGo bald with style."

This can give you the vital seconds required to purchase / cop that exclusive sales item.  \n\n- Ticketing sites: will often keep you in a queue on a web page known as a ‘holding page’, on some sites refreshing this page can get you through to the purchase page. This is where The Refreshinator helps, More refreshes = More chances of a ticket. When you are stuck on a \"holding page\", The Refreshinator can be set to automatically refresh the holding page until you get onto the purchase area. As each refresh is a chance, the speed you refresh the page counts Increases your chances. The Refreshinator can do this faster than a person and can drastically improve your chances of getting through a ticket queue. The App was used to purchase tickets in the Glastonbury ticket sale and Glastonbury Resale, it get through to the purchase area over ten times in an average of 30 seconds. Once in 3 seconds.\n\n- Chat rooms / sports sites:  Some sites do not refresh when updates occur, you can set the Refreshinator to Refresh a site until a a game finishes or a chat group updates, in these scenarios we recommend using a a refresh rate of 5 - 15 seconds as updates are not so frequent.\n\n- Job listings, some site put up job listing at a given point of time however watching and refreshing the site continuously is a chore. Just put in the key word or phrase and set the app to keep refreshing until the listing appears."

      "label": "The stories of encounters with the Ghost-O-Meter continue to spread. One look at the reviews will tell you there is definitely something special about this app. But how did it get started? Here's the story behind the creation of Ghost-O-Meter...\n\nNobody took it seriously at first. Unexplained noises. The occasional sound of soft voices. Was that the wind? Sometimes our monitors would flicker. Certain places in the office were noticeably colder than others. Nothing to worry about. Or so we thought. \n\nThen things got kind of creepy. Things started going missing. Cryptic messages appearing on the mirrors in the bathroom. Some days the whole building would feel like it was swaying. Things would go missing then reappear elsewhere in our building. Finally, we had to confront the possibility that maybe, just maybe, the building was haunted. \n\nGhost-O-Meter is a tool created for detecting ghosts. As Ghost-O-Meter detects paranormal activity the needle will move and vibrate. If the ghost readings are strong enough the light will glow brightly. If you actually find a ghost the counter will increase to indicate a successful ghost encounter. \n\nUse Ghost-O-Meter to scan your building for paranormal activity. Get a creepy feeling at a certain spot in the woods? Test it for ghosts. Sometimes even the safest spots could be filled with spirits. You don't know until you test it. Download the Ghost-O-Meter today and see if you can find any ghosts. This app was created for your entertainment, and while we can't guarantee true ghost metering/locating functionality, it definitely has an uncanny ability to give unexplained feedback. \n\nNOTE: iPhones older than the 3GS don't have components sensitive enough to detect ghost activity. \n\nWhat people are saying about Ghost-O-Meter:\n\"My wife and I took the ghost tour at the Stanley (the most haunted place in America) and afterwards took our own tour using Ghost-O-Meter. This app was 100% 'dead on' outside rooms 217, 401 and 428.\" - Philip Hastings, December 18, 2011"

Our apps have been featured in many famous worldwide publications.\n\nEach sound was meticulously remastered to cut out any background noise. All of our sounds are purchased from a legitimate large company to ensure they comply with copyright laws and are high quality. All of our apps include a help page with easy to read instructions, tips, and a link to our contact form. We typically respond to emails within twenty-four hours or less.\n\nOur apps are easy to use and feature a nice clean interface (see screenshot below). They also include a loop button so you can endlessly loop any of the sounds. We were one of the first development companies for iOS, and we hope you enjoy our applications. People often find this app helpful when searching for things like water, waters, water sound, water sounds, water noise, water noises, iWater, and iWaters."

The fireballs are fast and indestructible and must be manically dodged. \n\nLevel 4.- Flies the player over a large metropolis. Missiles fired at the player from the tops of buildings again become a threat. \n\nLevel 5.- Sends the player into obnoxiously tight machine tunnels. Pilot error is the only though formidable enemy. \n\nThe final level has the player make an attack run on the Base, defended only by its position in a deep valley.

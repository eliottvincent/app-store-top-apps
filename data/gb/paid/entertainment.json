Open the app, find the channels list, look for the channel you want to watch and then press play. TV Launcher takes away that pain by allowing you to open any of the supported streaming apps directly to the channel.\n\n\nTV Launcher contains these great features:\n\nUK STREAMING PLATFORMS\n\nTV Launcher supports all of the main UK streaming platforms that have live TV and a few more too! You’ll be able to jump straight to channels in BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, My5, NOW (Sky), Discovery+, TalkTV, euronews, France 24, Al Jazeera and Bloomberg. There's also support for quick access to UKTV Play, Pluto TV, DAZN, STV Player and RTÉ Player as well which unfortunately don't support launching channels fully.\n\n\nWIDGETS & SHORTCUTS\n\nYou don’t even have to open TV Launcher to get to the channel you want to watch. With the Widget, you can launch channels directly from your Home Screen and support for Siri Shortcuts means you can watch channels using just your voice!\n\n\nTV GUIDE\n\nChoose to see what's on now and up next or, view a full day's worth of listing so you can decide what to watch before choosing a channel.\n\n\nFAVOURITES\n\nIf you have a select few channels you always like to watch, add them to your favourites list.\n\n\nHIDE CHANNELS\n\nNot interested in the news or don’t have kids? Choose the channels you want to hide and only keep around the ones you’re likely to watch. If you don’t have a streaming app installed, you can hide channels from those too.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNCING\n\nYour favourite channels, hidden channels and other settings all sync via iCloud so if you have multiple devices using TV Launcher, they'll all be kept in sync.\n\n\nREGION\n\nDifferent parts of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland & Northern Ireland) have slight variations to their standard channels. Choose your region in the settings menu and you’ll be shown the channels you expect.\n\n\nORGANISATION\n\nTV Launcher supports many layout configurations so you can organise your channels exactly how you’d like to find them. There’s options like a full list, grouping by app or even by category too.\n\n\nCUSTOMISATION\n\nOnce you’ve organised your channels, choose how to display them with options like the ability to show channel names or group names.\n\n\nSEARCH\n\nIf you can’t find the channel you’re looking for, search for it!\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: support@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note that to watch a selected channel, you will need the respective app installed. TV Launcher cannot be guaranteed to work outside the UK due to the selection of apps available in specific countries. All channels and their respective trademarks are owned by them and this app is not affiliated with them in any way."

Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science. While the periodic table in Toca Lab: Elements is accurate, the way new elements are created is not. Instead, it’s a fun way to experiment, discover and create curiosity in the world of science. Toca Lab: Elements is just a starting point for further exploration! \n\n***\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

      "label": "Get ready to rescue baby dinosaurs with Blaze and AJ in Blaze’s Dinosaur Egg Rescue Game!  \n\nThis iPhone app exposes preschoolers to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) concepts as they travel through Dino Valley with Blaze and AJ to find lost dinosaur eggs.\n\nThroughout the adventure, children are encouraged to develop problem-solving strategies and complete physics-based puzzles using water, bouncy balls and lasers to rescue dinosaur eggs from dangerous situations. Each location contains between one to three eggs, along with a hidden prehistoric gem!\n\nTOOLS: To rescue the dinosaur eggs, children are encouraged to manipulate the following tools and simple machines:\n-\tWheels\n-\tPulleys\n-\tCranks\n-\tLevers\n-\tMirrors (static and rotating)\n-\tSolar panels\n-\tPendulums\n\nCONCEPTS: In addition to experimenting with different tools, children are exposed to the following STEM concepts:\n-\tHeight (e.g. moving Blaze up or down to reach certain locations)\n-\tWeight (e.g. adding objects to a  bucket connected to a pulley)\n-\tTrajectory (e.g. manipulating the path of water, bouncy balls or a laser)\n-\tAdhesion (e.g. using a “sticky patch” to trap items and construct a path to complete the puzzle)\n\nHANDS-ON APPROACH TO LEARNING\nThis educational iPhone game for kids fosters a hands-on, experiential approach to STEM learning through critical-thinking challenges that enhance children’s understanding of physics puzzles and how things work. Kids learn with the help of their best friend Blaze - the coolest truck from the popular Nick Jr TV show!\n\nADDITIONAL GAME FEATURES\n-\t3 Blaze transformations – Blaze can shoot water, bouncy balls, or laser beams!\n-\tExplore three locations in Dino Valley and navigate different types of terrain – the jungle, rocky plateaus and a volcano!\n-\t45 levels – Solve forty-five physics puzzles to locate over 80 dinosaur eggs and a prehistoric gem on every level! \n\n\nBlaze and the Monster Machines Dinosaur Rescue collects personal user data as well as non-personal user data (including aggregated data).

All of the former add-on features of the original version are now included as part of the base price.\n• New! Screensaver mode when running the app for extended periods of time. \n• New! Totally reimagined particle visualizations.\n• New! Stealth Skin\n• New! Dark theme backgrounds in the History and Features screens\n• New! Frequently Asked Questions section\n\nSame great features:\n• Running list of results is saved automatically. Individual entries can be deleted.\n• Share results with friends. \n\nSpirit Story Box: the spirits are telling their stories!"

Safe, ad-free fun for your little ones.\n\nJoin Duggee and the Squirrels as they work hard to earn seven brand new badges: \n\n•\tCatch the falling acorns; \n•\tGrow your own fruit and veg; \n•\tRound up the missing sheep; \n•\tLearn Duggee’s raindance; \n•\tPilot your submarine in an underwater adventure; \n•\tMake a paper boat to help the ants!\n•\tAnd finally, hit the beach and build a glorious sandcastle.\n\nCompleting each activity earns the Squirrel a badge. With 5 Squirrels playing for 7 badges each, that’s a whole lot of Duggee Hugs!\n\nKey Features:\n\n•\tSeven fun activities with a variety of gameplay styles \n•\tDevelop fine motor control skills in the Acorn Badge \n•\tImprove attention skills, reaction times and speech skills in the Food Growing Badge \n•\tPractice counting in the Sheep Badge  \n•\tPromote gross motor control skills in the Raindance Badge \n•\tDevelop concentration and planning skills in the Submarine Badge\n•\tEncourage creativity in the Paper Boat and Sandcastle Badges\n•\tVisit your gallery to see all of your wonderful adventures\n\nGames:\n\nThe Acorn Badge\nSome animals collect acorns to eat through the winter. Use your excellent catching skills to fill your cart with lots of lovely acorns! Look out for those elusive Special Acorns! And be careful not to slip on the banana skins...\n\nThe Food Growing Badge\nShall we grow our own fruit and veg, Squirrels? First, you plant your seed. Next, you cover it with soil. And finally, you give it a lovely big drink of water! You’ll need to protect your plant from pests… and you’ll need to talk to it to help it grow. What green fingers you have!\n\nThe Sheep Badge\nThe sheep are missing? Let’s round them all up! Twist and weave your way through the trees and bushes, picking up sheep as you go. 1 sheep, 2 sheep, 3 sheep… all the way up to 10 sheep! Are you keeping count? \n\nThe Raindance Badge\nA raindance is a dance that people do to try to make it rain! This game will really get you moving. First, you’ll need to learn the steps: Clap, clap, wiggle, jump! Now you know the moves, let’s dance along to the music. Excellent…you’ve made it rain!\n\nThe Submarine Badge\nHow exciting... an underwater adventure! Use your finger to track the bubbles and watch as the submarine follows the trail. Collect a Jazz Fish and it’ll play you a rhythmic tune. See if you can spot the Giant Sea Stallion! \n\nThe Paper Boat Badge\nOh no! The Ants are late for their picnic! Let’s make them a paper boat to get them safely across the pond. Practice your origami with some skillful folding. Once you’ve crafted your paper boat, finish it off with some nautical decorations. Lastly, shout ‘faster!’ and watch your boat speed across the water. \n\nThe Sandcastle Badge\nIt’s the summer holidays and Duggee’s organised a day trip to the beach! Help the Squirrels earn their badge by building a fortress made of sand!  \n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

      "label": "**** As seen on Nick Jr. *****\n\nThe very first official Hey Duggee app for the new Nick Jr. pre-school favourite. It’s Duggee Time!\n\nSafe, trusted, ad-free fun for your little ones.\n \nJoin Duggee and the Squirrels at the Clubhouse as they work hard to earn their badges: Re-style Duggee's crazy hair; bring out your inner artist and colour in your favourite Squirrel; dress up each of the squirrels in their heroic Super Squirrel costumes; put your chef's hat on and bake a cake with Duggee; turn super-sleuth as you hunt for an outstanding leaf collection; get Christmassy and decorate a tree with Duggee. \n \nKey Features:\n•\tExplore the Squirrel Club and interact with all your favourite characters across 6 fun games\n• \tCollect six badges for each of the Squirrels – but make sure you leave time for a Duggee Hug!\n• \tVisit your gallery to see a Polaroid of all your wonderful game creations \n \nGames:\n \nThe Hair Badge\nCut, colour and style Duggee’s hair any way you want, using lots of different tools – a brush, scissors, colour dye and even hair growth cream for when you snip off too much. Frizzy hair, straight hair, blue hair…the choice is yours.\n  \nThe Drawing Badge\nSelect from different pens, pencils and paints to colour in the Squirrels - a pink and red Norrie with spots or a stripy Betty perhaps. When you’re happy with your drawing, watch with pride as Duggee displays your picture in the Clubhouse.\n \nThe Super Squirrel Badge\nDress up the Squirrels in an exciting range of heroic Super Squirrel outfits. Mix and match capes, masks, hats and more to style your Super Squirrel then watch them display their amazing costumes especially for you.\n \nThe Cake Badge\nThere’s lots of ingredients for you to add to your cake, so you’ll need to give it a good stir before Duggee pops it in the oven. The it’s time to decorate it with different coloured icing, sprinkles, fruit and more, present your cake to Duggee and the Squirrels so they can tuck in.\n \nThe Leaf Badge\nUsing your superb powers of detection, can you help the Squirrels spot the correct leaves to add to their collections. Explore different fully interactive scenes to try to find the special leaves and discover a few familiar faces along the way.\n\nThe Tinsel Badge\nChristmas is coming but the Clubhouse isn’t looking very Christmassy! Help the Squirrels earn their Tinsel Badge by decorating Duggee’s Christmas tree. First pick a tree. Next, you'll need to add tinsel, baubles, and a special fairy! Finally, cover the tree with multi-coloured lights and watch the Clubhouse illuminate!  \n \nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

      "label": "Necrophone Pro is a real ghost app designed specifically for spirit communication and paranormal research. This spirit box contains a preloaded soundbank with a large variety of words, similar to ghost tube.\n\nNew features in the ghost box include white noise, reverb and echo. This ITC ghost hunting app has a very creepy vibe, and gives good results whilst trying to communicate with the dead.\n\nThe sound bank files use a the full range of low, mid and high frequencies making it much easier for communication with the dead.\n\nOur real ghost app contains full and partial words in English at varying quality levels. And partial words in other languages. Sample partial phonetic words include things such as bi, bo, um, ye, na.\n\nOur spirit box may sound similar to other ghost hunting tools such as Necrophonic, Paratek ghost box, DeadWave spirit box and Ghost Tube.\n\nThe white noise background in our real ghost app can be turned on and off, and the background is a moving video to give a creepy and spooky vibe to get you in the mood for your ghost hunting app.\n\nIf you want to record your spirit box session you can use a separate EVP recorder or ghost tube with it. Or use with an EMF meter to detect any electrical spikes while using Necrophone ghost hunting tools to communicate with the spirits. Or an SLS camera, like ghost tube to be able to see them as well.\n\n*No Advertisements\n*No Popups\n*No Subscriptions\n*No In App Purchases\n*Lifetime Use\n\nQUICK TIPS: Never go out alone, especially in abandoned places, always take a friend or family member to stay safe when using ghost hunting tools. Ensure you choose a location which is known to be haunted. As no real responses will come through if there are no spirits. Only randomly generated words. Always be polite to the spirits and don't challenge them whilst using ghost hunting tools.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This ghost hunting app picks words at random from the word bank. It is believed that ghosts are able to manipulate electrical devices, and may be able to override the words which the ghost box picks. But there is no guarantee or scientifical evidence to prove this. So please use our real ghost app at your own risk.\n\n\nHow to get the most from your ghost hunting tools\n\n1. Before using your ghost hunting app, picked a haunted place. No real ghost app will work if there are not any ghosts in the location you are at. First find a haunted location, which will dramatically increase the chances of getting replies from your ghost app or spirit box.\n\n2. Once you have picked your haunted location, take some friends or family members with you to ensure your safety whilst using your real ghost app. Using your real ghost app and ghost box is always more fun with friends.\n\n3. Once you arrive at the haunted place, say hello to the spirits and introduce yourself before using your ghost hunting tools. Treat spirits like people, they will be much more likely to respond if you are polite to them. Once ready, you can start your real ghost app session. Start your ghost box and ask if any spirits are there. Once you start getting intelligent responses from the ghost app or spirit box, you can start documenting your evidence.\n\nYOUR GHOST BOX AND SPIRIT BOX CAN BE VERY HELPFUL COMMUNICATION WITH THE OTHER SIDE. But you also need to increase your chances be ensuring spirits are there, and you are polite to them. Don't just ask the same repetitive questions, think of something new, original and engaging."

      "label": "Do you enjoy watching videos on your iPhone? Do you hate not being able to because your iPhone cannot support the video format? Or do you hate the inconvenient and time-consuming hassle of trying to convert video formats to fit into one that your iPhone can support? \nThis is why the AVPlayer was created. The AVPlayer can play almost any computer video file format such as AVI, Xvid, WMV and much more clearly and effortlessly. No converting hassles. Just copy files via USB and just drag and drop into the AVPlayer’s Media Explorer. \nThe AVPlayer can also support external subtitle files such as SMI and SRT. So if you enjoy watching videos on your iPad, then the AVPlayer is an absolute necessity. \n\n• Support Formats\n- Dolby Digital (AC3), Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3)\n- Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- MP4,MOV,M4V\n- XVID,AVI,WMV,RMVB,ASF,H264,MKV… most of all movie file formats. \n- SMI, SRT, TXT, SubStationAlpha Subtitles \n\n• Post Processing \n- High quality video processing \n- Contrast,Saturation,Brightness \n- TV-Out \n\n• Control the playback speed (From 0.5X to 2.0X) \n- User setting support \n- Sweep to the left : move to backword 10 sec \n- Sweep to the right : move to forward 10 sec \n- Sweep to the top : 1.5X speed \n- Sweep to the down : normal speed \n\n• Additional features \n- Rotation Lock / Aspect ratio:auto/16:9/4:3/Full screen \n- Folder Management:Pass code/Move/Rename/Create \n- Resume play from last position \n- Scrubbing search \n- supports e-mail attachment by \"Open In\" feature \n\n• USB/WIFI Transfer \n\n• Note \n1. How to add video with USB \n- Run iTunes 9.1 or above \n- Device->My Device(My iPad)->Apps, drag and drop files to the AVplayer's documents \n\n2. Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal."

      "label": "You’ve discovered the Original and World Famous iFart® App.  An Apple All-Time TOP 20 App.  The definitive Fart Sounds app on iTunes.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nFeatured on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Today Show and many others, iFart® is considered the most infamous app of all time. \r\n\r\nAlso seen in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, MSNBC.com, MacDailyNews, MacForums, The New York Times, Barron's, Motley Fool, Gizmodo, Venture Beat, Ars Technica, CNET News, Geek.com, Forbes, The UK Register, Information Week, TechCrunch.com and dozens of publications all over the world!\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\niFart® took the app world by storm in 2008. It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

      "label": "From the brilliant idea and creation of Angelo Carbone, the app was developed by magician and developer Alessandro Albergo.\n\nIt’s back! After many years off the App Store.\nMagic SMS was first released back in 2011. Then Magic SMS 2 was released in 2015. Now here in 2022 we have Psychic Prediction.\n\nThis app is for entertainment purposes only.\n\n\"The best magic trick app that I've seen; beautifully thought through.\" - Derren Brown\n\n\"This is such a strong and effective use of magic on the iPhone. Finally!\" - David Blaine\n\n\"Magic SMS is the coolest effect I've seen in years! Trust me you'll be texting everyone about this. Amazing!\" - Dynamo\n\n\"Magic SMS represents a real leap forward in the development of iPhone magic. If you have an iPhone and like magic, you should buy it.\" - MAGIC Magazine Review\n\n* As performed live on London's LBC Radio and one of LBC Radio's Best Apps of the Year. *\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nImagine a magic app that does not look like you are running an app...\n\nImagine a magic app that creates powerful mind reading magic...\n\nIntroducing Magic SMS 2... Mind Reading via Text Message.\n\n\nThe Effect: You tell your friend that you know someone who is psychic and that you want to put him to the test. You ask your friend to freely think of any colour and any playing card. Nothing is spoken or written down.\n\nYou send a text message to your psychic asking him to guess what your friend is thinking of. You then turn off your phone and put it aside. From this point on you NEVER touch the phone AGAIN.\n\nYou both patiently wait for the text message to arrive. Moments later, an SMS does arrive. The preview message in the Lock Screen shows that it is indeed from the psychic. Now that the message has arrived you ask your friend for the first time to confirm what they had thought of.\n\nYou ask your friend to pick up the phone (as you don’t want to touch it) and to read the full reply. They will be utterly amazed to see that the psychic has correctly guessed both the freely thought of colour and playing card.\n\nWOW!\n\n\n• Easy to do but very POWERFUL in effect!\n• The FIRST EVER magic app to use this UNIQUE principle.\n• No voice activation, G-Sensor use, icon swiping or suspicious turning over of the phone.\n• No masking or hiding of the screen. Everything is done openly and fairly.\n• You NEVER touch the phone, once the text has been sent.\n• Once you know what colour and card your friend has thought of you STILL never touch the phone.\n• SMS reply can be customised to say whatever you want.\n• 9 routines plus new improvements from the original Magic SMS app.\n• A truly free choice of ANY colour and ANY playing card. A staggering 530 possible combinations.\n\n** SUPPORTED LANGUAGES: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish and Portuguese.**\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nSUPPORT INFORMATION\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have any issues, please contact magicsms@live.com or allab.developer@gmail.com before leaving a review and we will be happy to assist."

      "label": "Thunder for Philips Hue done right. Finally.\n\nMeet the most spectacular and realistic Thunder Ambiance app available for Philips Hue. It's truly immersive. \n\nHue Thunder provides an unique thunder simulation in various settings. Every time you start one of the ambiances it will be different and unpredictable. Al light effects have been precisely created and synced with thunder sound to create and impressive simulation with your Philips Hue setup. It will impress everyone.\nHue thunder can also be used to train pets to get used to thunder sounds and lightning flashes.\n\nOur unique node based soundscape engine, which is behind the beautiful designed and intuitive user interface, is truly innovative. It uses techniques which are used by top game designers and audio engineers to mimic nature's way and randomness. On top of that our soundscape apps use a unique and simple to use occurrence slider to let you decide how often a specific bird or other sound is used in the preset. Still it's totally unpredictable when a specific sound is being heard therefore producing an amazingly natural sound experience. It can run for hours on end without getting repetitive like other sound engines do. \n\nChoose from the following thunder presets and themes:\n\nThunder presets:\n- Light drizzle.\n- On a rainy day.\n- Heavy rain pours down.\n- Light thunder storm.\n- Inside the thunder storm.\n- Heavy thunder storm.\n- Tornado Alley.\n- Hurricane mayhem.\n\nThunder Ambient presets:\n- A damp rain forest.\n- At the beach after a warm day.\n- Staring out the window in a busy city.\n- A walk in the city under the umbrella.\n- Bad weather camping at the lake.\n- Storm over NYC.\n- After the storm.\n- In the car.\n- Bike ride through Amsterdam.\n\nThe following elements can be altered during playback:\n- Sky brightness.\n- Sky On/Off\n- Thunder brightness.\n- Thunder occurrence.\n- Environment volume.\n- Thunder volume.\n\nOther features:\n- Bluetooth and Airplay supported with delay compensation.\n- Sleep timer to safely fall asleep with a stormy fading background. Lights turn off after sleeptimer is finished.\n\n (Hue Thunder also works without Philips Hue, but obviously without light effects)."

This was in the 60'ies of the last century. Since then a lot has changed, but many of us remember the days when there was no Graphical User Interface.\n\nThis app now is introducing DOS for mobile devices. Not laptops, but phones. iPhone and iPad, to be precise. It is a perfect emulator of the DOS that so many games and applications in the 80'ies and 90'ies have been running on.\n\nWin and Win95 were running on DOS, showing what a 16bit operating system is capable of. If sys ini, commanc.com, config.sys and .exe sound familiar to you, then this is the app for you.\n\nThe DOS is not just a CLI, it is a full fledged operating system. It does everything that the Ancient DOS did. It is capable of executing batch files or installing some of the game classics that never made it past DOS. It probably runs much better than the original DOS used to run on old PC's, which were state of the art back then.\n\n30 years is old enough to be called vintage, and it brings as much power as it did back then ;-) With this app you can get this vintage feeling on your iPhone or iPad.\n\n◆Features\n    ▸ SoundCard emulation\n    ▸ External Bluetooth Keyboard\n    ▸ Disk Operating System\n    ▸ Everything you would expect from DOS ;)\n\nIf you have ideas, feedback, suggestions or anything else you would like to tell us, do not hesitate to drop us a line!\n\nAnd if you like Power DOS, be not shy to leave a good review!"

      "label": "Stop flipping through massive notebooks, or losing your notes entirely, while trying to keep track of your role-playing game progress. Save and easily search for non-player characters, game world locations, quests, and bosses in your favorite RPGs. Track NPC locations and quests, filter on complete or incomplete quests and locations, and view at-a-glance stats for your games. Must-have companion for massive RPG video games like Elden Ring, or your favorite Dungeons and Dragons campaign.\n\nShattered Ring is the easy-to-use iOS RPG game task tracking app you never knew you needed. Add notes to NPCs, and search not only on NPC, location, or quest name but the contents of your notes. Enter as little or as much information as you'd like. Create new NPCs with as little as a name, or add details about quests and locations when you create the NPC. You can always go back later and add existing locations or quests to an NPC you've created.\n\nWhy stop at notes? Take a picture of the map and save it to your Location images. Load your favorite game guides up in your iOS device browser and save the links to your NPC, location, quest or boss entries so you can easily visit them later. \n\nBut locations and quests aren't tied to NPCs alone! Enter quests you stumble across as you explore large, open-world video games. Or enter locations into the app when you discover new points of interest, and store details to remind you to come back later, such as the presence of a helpful merchant or a note that you didn't clear so you can come back later to see if there's any good loot. And don't forget to track your bosses - keep track of how many bosses you've defeated, and use the undefeated boss list as a reminder to come back and revisit the tougher bosses when you've leveled up or have better gear. Use boss notes to save dropped items, or save links to boss fight walkthroughs to help you figure how to beat them.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of games you can track in the Shattered Ring RPG game tracker. Store details about multiple Elden Ring playthroughs, track multiple D&D campaigns or other TTRPG sessions, or mix-and-match video game playthroughs with other RPG details."

Along the way, the Fool dances to the beat of the disc-jockey Magus, surfs with the Charioteer, and balances on a sword’s edge with figure-skating Adjustment.\n\nTabula Mundi Tarot is the work of The Rosetta Tarot’s creator, M. M. Meleen. Every card in Tabula Mundi Tarot remains faithful to the esoteric meaning of Aleister Crowley’s masterpiece, Thoth Tarot. However, Tabula Mundi is not at all a reworking of Lady Frieda Harris’ artworks for Thoth.\n\nTabula Mundi follows Thelemic philosophy and mirrors the structure of Thoth. Each card is painted according to the fourfold color scale developed by the adepts of the Golden Dawn, drawing on Alchemy, Astrology, and the Qabalah, often with an underlying sacred geometry grid.\n\nAs the Fool steps into the wormhole, he meets these modern interpretations of the Thoth archetypes, a vivid panorama of cognitive imagery. The Fool encounters the whole of creation with art that speaks to our time. Here are new inspiring images of the universal Tree of Life, updated for the discerning 21st century occultist.\n\n*Intuitive, elegant interface is easy for beginners and experts\n*Gorgeous full screen, high-resolution card images\n*Full support for all current iOS devices\n*Sophisticated journal\n*Includes full and unabridged book\n*20 spreads built in\n*Design your own layout with Free Form\n*Allow reversed cards or not\n*Option to use Major Arcana only\n*Zoom in to enlarge card details\n*Share reading via e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter\n*Animated shuffle & cut\n*Optional voice prompts\n*Customize with your own card meanings & reading cloths\n*Many adjustable settings\n*Book and card meanings available in English only\n\nHold the universe in your hands, with Tabula Mundi Tarot."

Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes.

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

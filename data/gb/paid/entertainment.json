      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

Open the app, find the channels list, look for the channel you want to watch and then press play. TV Launcher takes away that pain by allowing you to open any of the supported streaming apps directly to the channel.\n\n\nTV Launcher contains these great features:\n\nUS STREAMING PLATFORMS\n\nTV Launcher supports many US streaming platforms that have live TV! You’ll be able to jump straight to channels in CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX NOW, Discovery+, FXNOW, Pluto TV, TNT, TBS, Nat Geo TV, CNN, Bloomberg, DisneyNOW, ESPN and NBA.\n\n\nWIDGETS & SHORTCUTS\n\nYou don’t even have to open TV Launcher to get to the channel you want to watch. With the Widget, you can launch channels directly from your Home Screen and support for Siri Shortcuts means you can watch channels using just your voice!\n\n\nTV GUIDE\n\nChoose to see what's on now and up next or, view a full day's worth of listings so you can decide what to watch before choosing a channel.\n\n\nFAVORITES\n\nIf you have a select few channels you always like to watch, add them to your favorites list.\n\n\nHIDE CHANNELS\n\nNot interested in the news or don’t have kids? Choose the channels you want to hide and only keep around the ones you’re likely to watch. If you don’t have a streaming app installed, you can hide channels from those too.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNCING\n\nYour favorite channels, hidden channels and other settings all sync via iCloud so if you have multiple devices using TV Launcher, they'll all be kept in sync.\n\n\nREGION\n\nChoose from East or West so you get shown the channels you expect.\n\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nTV Launcher supports many layout configurations so you can organise your channels exactly how you’d like to find them. There’s options like a full list, grouping by app or even by category too.\n\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\n\nOnce you’ve organized your channels, choose how to display them with options like the ability to show channel names or group names.\n\n\nSEARCH\n\nIf you can’t find the channel you’re looking for, search for it!\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: support@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note that to watch a selected channel, you will need the respective app installed. TV Launcher cannot be guaranteed to work outside the US due to the selection of apps available in specific countries.

It also rolls a six-sided die (and doesn't cheat). But best of all . . . once per game, you get a Boon . . . an in-game advantage to help you kill the monsters, steal the treasure, and stab your buddy. There are almost 150 different Boons, all illustrated by John Kovalic. The higher your level when you ask for your Boon, the better it's likely to be. And when you reach the winning level, it plays a fanfare. Your friends will hate you . . .\n\nBonus features include:\n• Kill-O-Meter screen to keep track of combat scores.\n• Counters for Chez Geek and SPANC (Space Pirate Amazon Ninja Catgirls) illustrated with art from the games.\n\nThis app is NOT a stand-alone game! It is a game aid for the Munchkin card games and Munchkin Quest board games by Steve Jackson Games. Munchkin is the dungeon experience . . . with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff.

      "label": "This is a straightforward yet powerful app that acts as a polyphonic audio synthesizer with a virtually unlimited collection of sounds. Under the hood, It uses an AVAudioUnitSampler to generate the audio output when you touch one or more keys. The sounds that are available come from soundfont (SF2)  files, such as those available online for free (and of variable quality). \n\nThe app also exists as an AUv3 plug-in (included) so you can use it in your favorite music generation application such as GarageBand, Logic, or AUM. It also includes two AUv3 effects units – reverb and delay - which you can use separately as well..\n\nThe app supports MIDI input -- just connect a MIDI keyboard/controller to your iOS device and you should be good to go! There is also support for MIDI over Bluetooth.\n\nTo use, simply select a SoundFont name in the left list, then a patch name on the right and start playing. Some additional hints to get going:\n\n• Add a SoundFont (SF2) file that you have downloaded onto your iCloud Drive. Press the \"+\" button and then locate the file to add. You can always change the display name of the SoundFont  by swiping right. And you can remove a SoundFont that you no longer want by swiping left on its name.\n\n• Bring up reverb and delay effects by touching the wavy \"signal\" button.\n\n• Swipe right on a patch name to make it a favorite. Favorited patches have a star next to their name. You can edit the name of the favorite by again swiping right and selecting the edit action. You can remove a favorite by swiping left and selecting the remove action.\n\n• Touch the labels at either end of the black bar to change the range of the keyboard. You can go as low as \"C0\" and as high as \"C9\". You can also change the range by swiping left/right on the black bar. Note that this ability does not exist in the AUv3 extension -- use the native application keyboard controls to achieve the same results. You can also toggle the keyboard sliding feature by touching the small arrow between the note labels.\n\n• Switch between the soundfont patches listing and the favorites view by double-tapping on the patch name in the black bar above the keyboard. You can also swipe left/right with two fingers in the patches and favorites views to switch to the other view.\n\n• In the view of favorites, you can edit a favorite button by double-tapping on it. You can rearrange the favorite buttons with a tap-and-hold gesture.\n\nFinally, you can check out the source code! Go to the Support URL to find out more."

Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children.

Maybe. Decorative? Certainly. \n\nNB Sounds will only play through earphones on 1st gen iPod Touch.\n\nThanks to all who left comments and suggestions for improvement.

Use your excellent catching skills to fill your cart with lots of lovely acorns! Look out for those elusive Special Acorns! And be careful not to slip on the banana skins...\n\nThe Food Growing Badge\nShall we grow our own fruit and veg, Squirrels? First, you plant your seed. Next, you cover it with soil. And finally, you give it a lovely big drink of water! You’ll need to protect your plant from pests… and you’ll need to talk to it to help it grow. What green fingers you have!\n\nThe Sheep Badge\nThe sheep are missing? Let’s round them all up! Twist and weave your way through the trees and bushes, picking up sheep as you go. 1 sheep, 2 sheep, 3 sheep… all the way up to 10 sheep! Are you keeping count? \n\nThe Raindance Badge\nA raindance is a dance that people do to try to make it rain! This game will really get you moving. First, you’ll need to learn the steps: Clap, clap, wiggle, jump! Now you know the moves, let’s dance along to the music. Excellent…you’ve made it rain!\n\nThe Submarine Badge\nHow exciting... an underwater adventure! Use your finger to track the bubbles and watch as the submarine follows the trail. Collect a Jazz Fish and it’ll play you a rhythmic tune. See if you can spot the Giant Sea Stallion! \n\nThe Paper Boat Badge\nOh no! The Ants are late for their picnic! Let’s make them a paper boat to get them safely across the pond. Practice your origami with some skillful folding. Once you’ve crafted your paper boat, finish it off with some nautical decorations. Lastly, shout ‘faster!’ and watch your boat speed across the water. \n\nThe Sandcastle Badge\nIt’s the summer holidays and Duggee’s organised a day trip to the beach! Help the Squirrels earn their badge by building a fortress made of sand!  \n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty.\n\nBomb Jacke \"defuses\" the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb's fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching 20 or more bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Bomb Jacke may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game's bonuses and power-ups. The lit fuses have no strategic purpose other than the bonus; a lit bomb left unattended does not explode.\n\nYou control Bomb Jacke throughout the game. Bomb Jacke one and only mission is to collect all of the bombs in the stage before moving on to the next and collecting more. In his way will be several enemies which will seek to stop him. Bomb Jacke will lose one life any time he comes into contact with any of the enemies. There is no time limit, so Bomb Jacke can take as long as he needs to clear the stage. However, the longer you wait, the more likely it is that the enemies will overwhelm him. Bomb Jacke can turn the tables on his enemies by collecting a power coin (P), which will temporarily turn all of the enemies into coins which he can collect. Whether Bomb Jacke earns extra lives by reaching certain coins.\n\nPower Coin (P), Obtainable after meter filling the Bonus Multiplier 20 segments: unlit bombs by 1, and lit bombs by 2.\n\nBonus Coin (B), Obtainable every time the score reaches a multiple of 5,000, until the Bonus Multiplier reaches x5 per level.\n\nExtra Coin (E), Obtainable when Bomb Jacke has \"killed\" enough enemies by collecting them as Coins, and score reaches multiple of 50,000.\n\nEnjoy it!!!!"

It's truly immersive. \n\nHue Thunder provides an unique thunder simulation in various settings. Every time you start one of the ambiances it will be different and unpredictable. Al light effects have been precisely created and synced with thunder sound to create and impressive simulation with your Philips Hue setup. It will impress everyone.\nHue thunder can also be used to train pets to get used to thunder sounds and lightning flashes.\n\nOur unique node based soundscape engine, which is behind the beautiful designed and intuitive user interface, is truly innovative. It uses techniques which are used by top game designers and audio engineers to mimic nature's way and randomness. On top of that our soundscape apps use a unique and simple to use occurrence slider to let you decide how often a specific bird or other sound is used in the preset. Still it's totally unpredictable when a specific sound is being heard therefore producing an amazingly natural sound experience. It can run for hours on end without getting repetitive like other sound engines do. \n\nChoose from the following thunder presets and themes:\n\nThunder presets:\n- Light drizzle.\n- On a rainy day.\n- Heavy rain pours down.\n- Light thunder storm.\n- Inside the thunder storm.\n- Heavy thunder storm.\n- Tornado Alley.\n- Hurricane mayhem.\n\nThunder Ambient presets:\n- A damp rain forest.\n- At the beach after a warm day.\n- Staring out the window in a busy city.\n- A walk in the city under the umbrella.\n- Bad weather camping at the lake.\n- Storm over NYC.\n- After the storm.\n- In the car.\n- Bike ride through Amsterdam.\n\nThe following elements can be altered during playback:\n- Sky brightness.\n- Sky On/Off\n- Thunder brightness.\n- Thunder occurrence.\n- Environment volume.\n- Thunder volume.\n\nOther features:\n- Bluetooth and Airplay supported with delay compensation.\n- Sleep timer to safely fall asleep with a stormy fading background. Lights turn off after sleeptimer is finished.\n\n (Hue Thunder also works without Philips Hue, but obviously without light effects)."

It can also be used to keep a history of matches played, and to easily experiment with different methods of scoring.\n\nFeatures:\n* Multiple Matches\n* Beautiful, easy-to-read tiles.\n* Hand Scorer with intuitive tile/set-type selector (press, slide, and release to choose a tile)\n* Supports European Classical, Hong Kong, Japanese Modern / EMF Riichi (with Dora tiles and Red Fives), and Chinese Official (MCR / Competition) scoring\n* 4, 3, and 2 player scoring modes\n* Send scores from Hand Scorer to Score Sheet, or enter scores manually.\n* Score Sheet calculates payments between players, supports \"Ready\" declarations and counters in Japanese Mahjong.\n* see how the score is calculated on the \"Scoring\" panel - great for those learning the game, or just to double-check!\n* Supports seat rotation between rounds, or groups that prefer keeping the same positions throughout.\n* Share matches across devices - other players can keep a record of the match & contribute to scoring from their own devices.

      "label": "A Top 5 Best Selling App^ - The original Glow Doodle. \n\nGlow Doodle is thankfully the choice of many teachers worldwide who embrace educational technology to their classroom for art, math, language lessons and fine motor skill activities^^.\n\nGlow Doodle has all it takes to make a doodling app a Top 5 App among hundred thousands of Apps:\n\n- Originality:\nGlow Doodle was the first to bring razor sharp neon effect from the hands of professional designers to the fingertips of everyone of every age. It lit up iPhone users' Christmas & winter nights with a magical mood like never before when Glow Doodle was introduced in winter 2009 \n\n- Quality-over-quantity & painstaking effort behind the simple to use App:\nWhile we could have allowed users to pick millions of random colors & line thickness, instead, we spent tedious effort to fine tune a few in order to maintain a harmonious & less confusing user experience for all ages. \n\n- Support from quality users:\nIt was the overwhelming support from our users propelled Glow Doodle to TOP 5 Best Selling Paid App in the US and UK App Stores. We are grateful to our quality users including teachers, elementary teachers around the world who brought Glow Doodle to their classrooms with a creative mind & respect for originality, an invaluable message to our creative children.\n\n- Special Needs Friendly:\nParents & professionals including pediatric OTs taking care of kids with special needs such as autism have also found Glow Doodle useful. In addition to the simple user interface, Glow Doodle takes the approach of \"magic\" button which provides cause & effect experience to enhance visual sensory & fine motor skills developments. \n\n\nThe moment when you press the \"GLOW\" button, you will be amazed how a seemingly ordinary drawing turns into truly stunning Glow Doodle effect. It's a unique original experience that sets Glow Doodle apart from others who follow suit.\n\nNow updated with Nordic Ice Blue color (available via IAP) and option to draw with Apple Pencil only so that you can unleash your glowing creativity to the next level.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n* Razor sharp Light Glow Effect\n* Harmonious Doodle Colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Pink, White, Magenta\n* Auto-hiding toolbar (auto-hide while drawing)\n* Erase the previous stroke (by pressing the counter-clockwise arrow button)\n* Motivational Glowy Rocket may suddenly turn up\n* Save drawing to Photo Albums to share\n\nEDUCATION FRIENDLY SETTING:\n* Option to hide In-App Purchase button via Settings app\n\nAPPLE PENCIL FRIENDLY SETTING:\n* Option to allow drawing with Apple Pencil only via Settings app\n\nNORDIC ICE BLUE EDITION (Available via In-App Purchase):\n* Unlocks Nordic Ice Blue color\n* Unlocks Rocket Sure Launch - Instead of appearing once in a while, motivational Glowy Rocket launches every time you light up your drawing\n* Hides IAP button\n\n\n\nADVANCED DRAWING TIPS:\nYou can make part of your drawing \"glow\" (e.g. the flame of a rocket) while other part of the drawing doesn't \"glow\" (e.g. the rocket body). For example, (1) draw the flame of the rocket first; (2) then press the \"GLOW\" button to make it glow; (3) continue to draw the rocket body without pressing the \"GLOW\" button.\n\n\nREMARKS:\n^US & UK App Store; Jan 2010; Overall Paid Chart & Entertainment Paid Chart \n\nSHARE & FOLLOW:\nFollow us or Share with us on:\nTwitter https://twitter.com/GlowDoodle\nPinterest http://pinterest.com/oodot/\nFacebook http://www.facebook.com/CrossDisciplineTechnologyLimited\nFlickr http://www.flickr.com/photos/cdtapps/\n^^Sharing by teachers & schools: http://www.pinterest.com/oodot/glow-doodle-in-classroom-learning/"

Each layer has a treat (candy) and a piece of paper with something to do or say between the paper. In this case, the phone is the parcel. The group of people sit in a circle and pass the parcel (your phone) around the circle while the music plays. Once the music stops the person holding the phone gets to say or do what the phone says. Just like the traditional game, you should give a treat to the winner of each round. \r\n\r\nYou can set the number of players (it is designed so that each player gets to win twice). We usually play that if someone has won twice that they pass the parcel to left to a person that has not won twice. You can also pick the music and edit the list of things to do or say (just make sure to put each thing on a new line). Have fun with it and let us know any comments.\r\n\r\nThe college version has actions that are more .\r\n\r\nIf you come up with great things to do and would like to see them added to the game, Please send us an email to web@lajdesignsw.com and we will add them as appropriate. Thank and enjoy"

With normal, non-audio boards, the iPhone’s powerful internal speaker can be used. ALERT: this is so much fun that “silent” hoverboarding becomes hoverboring!

Each location contains between one to three eggs, along with a hidden prehistoric gem!\n\nTOOLS: To rescue the dinosaur eggs, children are encouraged to manipulate the following tools and simple machines:\n-\tWheels\n-\tPulleys\n-\tCranks\n-\tLevers\n-\tMirrors (static and rotating)\n-\tSolar panels\n-\tPendulums\n\nCONCEPTS: In addition to experimenting with different tools, children are exposed to the following STEM concepts:\n-\tHeight (e.g. moving Blaze up or down to reach certain locations)\n-\tWeight (e.g. adding objects to a  bucket connected to a pulley)\n-\tTrajectory (e.g. manipulating the path of water, bouncy balls or a laser)\n-\tAdhesion (e.g. using a “sticky patch” to trap items and construct a path to complete the puzzle)\n\nHANDS-ON APPROACH TO LEARNING\nThis educational iPhone game for kids fosters a hands-on, experiential approach to STEM learning through critical-thinking challenges that enhance children’s understanding of physics puzzles and how things work. Kids learn with the help of their best friend Blaze - the coolest truck from the popular Nick Jr TV show!\n\nADDITIONAL GAME FEATURES\n-\t3 Blaze transformations – Blaze can shoot water, bouncy balls, or laser beams!\n-\tExplore three locations in Dino Valley and navigate different types of terrain – the jungle, rocky plateaus and a volcano!\n-\t45 levels – Solve forty-five physics puzzles to locate over 80 dinosaur eggs and a prehistoric gem on every level! \n\n\nBlaze and the Monster Machines Dinosaur Rescue collects personal user data as well as non-personal user data (including aggregated data).

Thanks to the magnetometers present in the latest generation mobile phones *, you too can try your hand at researching variations in the electromagnetic field.\n\nIts functions are similar to those of a KII but enhanced for use on a smartphone. The more the electromagnetic field variations will be strong, the more the LEDs will light up to red.\n\nREM:\n\nThe Rem is an electronic device that allows you to receive answers to your questions.\n\nThe Rem has a built-in word database. Whenever a considerable variation in electromagnetism is recorded, the amplitude and intensity values ​​are combined to select a word from the reference database.\n\nThe first screen will show the word while the second will record the electromagnetism variations that caused the selection of that word.\n\nBLACK BOX:\nThis fantastic instrument perceives random chaotic noise and connects to a phonetic database from which it is possible to listen to the formation of words divided into syllables. Ask your question and listen to the answers that will come. Try to understand the words that will come out by joining the single phonemes.\n\nINFO ON OPERATION:\n\nTo test m1 just enter M1 function and approach an electrical socket or an electronic device on and the instrument will immediately show a change in magnetism.\n\nThanks to an algorithm developed by Team Pit, the App creates a triangulation between the three magnets inside the latest generation mobile phones to accurately calculate the magnetic anomalies in the environment.\n\n*ATTENTION*\n\nIn older mobile phones without the 3 magnetometers now used in most mobile phones, the app will not work properly and the M1 will light up with just the movement of the mobile phone. This is because it will simulate a compass and give false positive answers to just the movement of the mobile. \""

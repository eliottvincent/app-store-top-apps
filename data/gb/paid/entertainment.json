      "label": "The stories of encounters with the Ghost-O-Meter continue to spread. One look at the reviews will tell you there is definitely something special about this app. But how did it get started? Here's the story behind the creation of Ghost-O-Meter...\n\nNobody took it seriously at first. Unexplained noises. The occasional sound of soft voices. Was that the wind? Sometimes our monitors would flicker. Certain places in the office were noticeably colder than others. Nothing to worry about. Or so we thought. \n\nThen things got kind of creepy. Things started going missing. Cryptic messages appearing on the mirrors in the bathroom. Some days the whole building would feel like it was swaying. Things would go missing then reappear elsewhere in our building. Finally, we had to confront the possibility that maybe, just maybe, the building was haunted. \n\nGhost-O-Meter is a tool created for detecting ghosts. As Ghost-O-Meter detects paranormal activity the needle will move and vibrate. If the ghost readings are strong enough the light will glow brightly. If you actually find a ghost the counter will increase to indicate a successful ghost encounter. \n\nUse Ghost-O-Meter to scan your building for paranormal activity. Get a creepy feeling at a certain spot in the woods? Test it for ghosts. Sometimes even the safest spots could be filled with spirits. You don't know until you test it. Download the Ghost-O-Meter today and see if you can find any ghosts. This app was created for your entertainment, and while we can't guarantee true ghost metering/locating functionality, it definitely has an uncanny ability to give unexplained feedback. \n\nNOTE: iPhones older than the 3GS don't have components sensitive enough to detect ghost activity. \n\nWhat people are saying about Ghost-O-Meter:\n\"My wife and I took the ghost tour at the Stanley (the most haunted place in America) and afterwards took our own tour using Ghost-O-Meter. This app was 100% 'dead on' outside rooms 217, 401 and 428.\" - Philip Hastings, December 18, 2011"

      "label": "TV Launcher brings over 100 live UK TV channels that you know and love into one convenient launcher on your iPhone & iPad - perfect for cord-cutters!\n\n\n* As featured on iMore & 9to5Mac *\n\n\nThe Apple TV app makes it easy to track the programmes you’re watching but if you’re still wanting to watch live, you know the score. Open the app, find the channels list, look for the channel you want to watch and then press play. TV Launcher takes away that pain by allowing you to open any of the supported streaming apps directly to the channel.\n\n\nTV Launcher contains these great features:\n\nUK STREAMING PLATFORMS\n\nTV Launcher supports all of the main UK streaming platforms that have live TV and a few more too! You’ll be able to jump straight to channels in BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, My5, NOW (Sky), Discovery+, TalkTV, euronews, France 24, Al Jazeera and Bloomberg. There's also support for quick access to UKTV Play, Pluto TV, DAZN, STV Player and RTÉ Player as well which unfortunately don't support launching channels fully.\n\n\nWIDGETS & SHORTCUTS\n\nYou don’t even have to open TV Launcher to get to the channel you want to watch. With the Widget, you can launch channels directly from your Home Screen and support for Siri Shortcuts means you can watch channels using just your voice!\n\n\nTV GUIDE\n\nChoose to see what's on now and up next or, view a full day's worth of listing so you can decide what to watch before choosing a channel.\n\n\nFAVOURITES\n\nIf you have a select few channels you always like to watch, add them to your favourites list.\n\n\nHIDE CHANNELS\n\nNot interested in the news or don’t have kids? Choose the channels you want to hide and only keep around the ones you’re likely to watch. If you don’t have a streaming app installed, you can hide channels from those too.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNCING\n\nYour favourite channels, hidden channels and other settings all sync via iCloud so if you have multiple devices using TV Launcher, they'll all be kept in sync.\n\n\nREGION\n\nDifferent parts of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland & Northern Ireland) have slight variations to their standard channels. Choose your region in the settings menu and you’ll be shown the channels you expect.\n\n\nORGANISATION\n\nTV Launcher supports many layout configurations so you can organise your channels exactly how you’d like to find them. There’s options like a full list, grouping by app or even by category too.\n\n\nCUSTOMISATION\n\nOnce you’ve organised your channels, choose how to display them with options like the ability to show channel names or group names.\n\n\nSEARCH\n\nIf you can’t find the channel you’re looking for, search for it!\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: support@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note that to watch a selected channel, you will need the respective app installed. TV Launcher cannot be guaranteed to work outside the UK due to the selection of apps available in specific countries. All channels and their respective trademarks are owned by them and this app is not affiliated with them in any way."

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory.

When Bomb Jacke is jumping if tap Bomb Jacke glides in the air.\n\nThe Game\n-------------\n\nThe player controls Bomb Jacke, a superhero mighty mouse who can leap and glide. Someone has planted 24 bombs at landscapes. Bomb Jacke must fly around the screen to collect the bombs. Each screen uses a different configuration of platforms upon which Bomb Jacke may run and jump. Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty.\n\nBomb Jacke \"defuses\" the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb's fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching 20 or more bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Bomb Jacke may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game's bonuses and power-ups. The lit fuses have no strategic purpose other than the bonus; a lit bomb left unattended does not explode.\n\nYou control Bomb Jacke throughout the game. Bomb Jacke one and only mission is to collect all of the bombs in the stage before moving on to the next and collecting more. In his way will be several enemies which will seek to stop him. Bomb Jacke will lose one life any time he comes into contact with any of the enemies. There is no time limit, so Bomb Jacke can take as long as he needs to clear the stage. However, the longer you wait, the more likely it is that the enemies will overwhelm him. Bomb Jacke can turn the tables on his enemies by collecting a power coin (P), which will temporarily turn all of the enemies into coins which he can collect. Whether Bomb Jacke earns extra lives by reaching certain coins.\n\nPower Coin (P), Obtainable after meter filling the Bonus Multiplier 20 segments: unlit bombs by 1, and lit bombs by 2.\n\nBonus Coin (B), Obtainable every time the score reaches a multiple of 5,000, until the Bonus Multiplier reaches x5 per level.\n\nExtra Coin (E), Obtainable when Bomb Jacke has \"killed\" enough enemies by collecting them as Coins, and score reaches multiple of 50,000.\n\nEnjoy it!!!!"

      "label": "\"Become a paranormal investigator too with the amazing new Pro del Pit app. Have fun testing your courage or put yourself in the shoes of a paranormal investigator.\n\nThe Ghost Finder contains the three most important tools used by investigators of the paranormal: The Ghost Box, the M1 and the Rem, developed ad hoc by the Pit Team.\n\nGHOST BOX:\n\nThe Ghost Box or Spirit Box is an AM FM radio that quickly changes the frequency for the purpose of listening to EVPs.\n\nThis radio varies the frequency with a rhythm ranging from 100 milliseconds to 500 milliseconds and the resulting electronic voice tends to take effect from the white noise of the frequency.\n\nM1:\n\nThe M1 is an electromagnetic field meter. Thanks to the magnetometers present in the latest generation mobile phones *, you too can try your hand at researching variations in the electromagnetic field.\n\nIts functions are similar to those of a KII but enhanced for use on a smartphone. The more the electromagnetic field variations will be strong, the more the LEDs will light up to red.\n\nREM:\n\nThe Rem is an electronic device that allows you to receive answers to your questions.\n\nThe Rem has a built-in word database. Whenever a considerable variation in electromagnetism is recorded, the amplitude and intensity values ​​are combined to select a word from the reference database.\n\nThe first screen will show the word while the second will record the electromagnetism variations that caused the selection of that word.\n\nBLACK BOX:\nThis fantastic instrument perceives random chaotic noise and connects to a phonetic database from which it is possible to listen to the formation of words divided into syllables. Ask your question and listen to the answers that will come. Try to understand the words that will come out by joining the single phonemes.\n\nINFO ON OPERATION:\n\nTo test m1 just enter M1 function and approach an electrical socket or an electronic device on and the instrument will immediately show a change in magnetism.\n\nThanks to an algorithm developed by Team Pit, the App creates a triangulation between the three magnets inside the latest generation mobile phones to accurately calculate the magnetic anomalies in the environment.\n\n*ATTENTION*\n\nIn older mobile phones without the 3 magnetometers now used in most mobile phones, the app will not work properly and the M1 will light up with just the movement of the mobile phone. This is because it will simulate a compass and give false positive answers to just the movement of the mobile. \""

Disguised as a simple “Doodle” program, iForce is lurking inside, unseen and undetectable. Everything is examinable, which adds to the mystery. \n\niForce is the ONLY magic product that lets you create on-the-spot custom tricks that you perform instantly. Make this app uniquely yours and put it to work in entertaining ways. \n\nSo what are you waiting for, Master Magician? \nYou don’t need any props . . . just download iForce now. \n\n• Easy to do . . . learn with both written and video instructions \n• Comes with several amazing effects that you’ll perform immediately \n• Anything that you can draw/write can be your prediction ...

Each location contains between one to three eggs, along with a hidden prehistoric gem!\n\nTOOLS: To rescue the dinosaur eggs, children are encouraged to manipulate the following tools and simple machines:\n-\tWheels\n-\tPulleys\n-\tCranks\n-\tLevers\n-\tMirrors (static and rotating)\n-\tSolar panels\n-\tPendulums\n\nCONCEPTS: In addition to experimenting with different tools, children are exposed to the following STEM concepts:\n-\tHeight (e.g. moving Blaze up or down to reach certain locations)\n-\tWeight (e.g. adding objects to a  bucket connected to a pulley)\n-\tTrajectory (e.g. manipulating the path of water, bouncy balls or a laser)\n-\tAdhesion (e.g. using a “sticky patch” to trap items and construct a path to complete the puzzle)\n\nHANDS-ON APPROACH TO LEARNING\nThis educational iPhone game for kids fosters a hands-on, experiential approach to STEM learning through critical-thinking challenges that enhance children’s understanding of physics puzzles and how things work. Kids learn with the help of their best friend Blaze - the coolest truck from the popular Nick Jr TV show!\n\nADDITIONAL GAME FEATURES\n-\t3 Blaze transformations – Blaze can shoot water, bouncy balls, or laser beams!\n-\tExplore three locations in Dino Valley and navigate different types of terrain – the jungle, rocky plateaus and a volcano!\n-\t45 levels – Solve forty-five physics puzzles to locate over 80 dinosaur eggs and a prehistoric gem on every level! \n\n\nBlaze and the Monster Machines Dinosaur Rescue collects personal user data as well as non-personal user data (including aggregated data).

May it live long and prosper.” – Examiner.com\n\n“Shatoetry boldly goes where no app has gone before” – IGN & Mashable\n\n“It will keep you amused and connected with your friends\" – MacNewsWorld\n\n“Shatoetry combines the addictive nature of magnet poetry with the convenience of a smart phone app… Playing alone is fun, but it could be a really cool party game, too. All of these qualities make the app well worth the price to download.”  – Nerdist\n\n“Once you download it you'll say to yourself, ‘Of course! This app is brilliant!’”  – Crave Online\n\n“Totally different than anything else you’ve ever seen.” – William Shatner\n\n**********\n\nI am pleased to present to you my official app. \n\nI created it to invite you to collaborate with me – through Shatoetry.\n\nShatoetry lets you arrange words to compose sentences, statements, phrases, messages… and hear me perform them for you.\n\nThat’s right: You author it, and I’ll recite it.\n\nAnd what do we call that? A Shatism, of course.\n\nYou can save the Shatisms you create, send them to your friends by email, and share them through social media.\n\nYou can team up with other Shatoetists through GameCenter and co-create with your friends online. Or pass it around the room to take turns Shatoetizing with that person next to you.\n\nSome people like to use it to compose poetry and haiku… but the more common and practical creations are simple sentences, phrases, word juxtapositions… even individual words sent in my voice as messages, comments, and communications to friends can be really fun.\n\nYou’ve heard my spoken-word performances. But until now, you’ve only ever heard what I wanted to say. This one-of-a-kind app makes it truly interactive for everyone. It’s a way for you to express your thoughts and your ideas, using my voice.\n\nNow when you want to say something, with Shatoetry on your iPhone, I’m there to say it for you!\n\nSo give it a try. And happy Shatoetizing!\n\nMy best, Bill\n\n--------\n\n***  If you'd like assistance, please email our support team at support@shatoetry.com. \n\n*** This app contains over 500 words, each with 3 different versions in delivery... so you can't say *everything* but you sure can say a lot of things! Additional wordpacks are available for purchase from within the app."

      "label": "DRIVING BY RAIL\nIn \"Little Fox Train Adventures\", children can travel by train through enchanting landscapes and visit various places. At farms and factories, they help to load and unload the wagons, produce goods and deliver them to the next city. Lovely illustrations, fun animations and simple controls make the app suitable even for little children.\n\nBRING IN THE HARVEST AND LOAD THE TRAIN\nKids can bring in the harvest and load the train at over 10 different farms. They help to harvest fruit trees and vegetable fields, collect eggs from the chicken farm or milk the cows.\n\nTAKE YOUR HARVEST TO THE FACTORY\nThe harvest must now be taken to factories to process it. Whether it's carrot cupcakes, peach ice cream or socks made of alpaca wool - in over 20 factories, children can playfully learn about production processes, play an active part in them and trigger fun animations.\n\nSELL THE GOODS IN THE CITY\nAs soon as juice, cake or cheese have been loaded at the factory, the next stop will be the big city. The citizens are already waiting for new supply, so bring your goods to the supermarket quickly. But watch out for the gangster sheep, it wants to steal your goods!\n\nPERFECT FOR SMALL CHILDREN\nThe controls are very easy: By tapping you can harvest, load or accelerate the train. So even the younger ones can easily navigate through the app.\n\"Little Fox Train Adventures\" was illustrated by Karoline Pietrowski. With great attention to detail and the use of handmade textures and brushes, the scenes look like a picture book.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS:\n- Easy control, optimized for children between 2 and 5 years\n- Picturesque landscapes\n- Over 30 different stations\n- Funny characters and funny animations\n- Loving graphics and music\n- No internet or WiFi required - play wherever you want!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

      "label": "RemoteMedia is an app that enables you to connect to a remote UPnP or DLNA Certified media server, browse its content (music, photos, or videos), and play it either locally on your device or remotely on any UPnP or DLNA Certified media renderer.\r\n\r\nIt works with any UPnP (http://www.upnp.org/) or DLNA Certified products (http://www.dlna.org/). There are thousand products on the market that are UPnP or DLNA Certified. This includes TVs, DVD and Blu-ray players, games consoles, digital media players, photo frames, cameras, NAS devices, PCs, mobile handsets, and more. DLNA stands for Digital Living Network Alliance. It enables multi-branded digital products to interoperate and share digital content, making it easier to connect and enjoy music, photos and videos in any room of your home.\r\n\r\nThe app can work as a DMP (Digital Media Player) i.e. find content on digital media servers (DMS) and provide playback and rendering capabilities, or as a DMC (Digital Media Controller), i.e. find content on digital media servers (DMS) and play it on digital media renderers (DMR) such as TVs, audio/video receivers, video displays and remote speakers for music.\r\n\r\nAll you need is:\r\n- a wireless home network\r\n- your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad connected to this network by Wi-Fi\r\n- a DMS hardware or software also connected to this network (can be wireless or wired). You can choose any of the servers in the lists provided below.\r\n- (optional - only if you want to use it as DMC) a DMR hardware or software also connected to this network (can be wireless or wired). You can choose any of the renderers in the lists provided below.\r\n\r\nLists of UPnP or DLNA Certified products:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UPnP_AV_media_servers_and_clients\r\nhttp://www.dlna.org/consumer-home/look-for-dlna/product-search\r\n\r\nHere are quick start instructions:\r\n- Make sure to be connected to Wi-Fi and connected to the same network as the media server you want to browse content.\r\n- Launch the app.\r\n- At app launch, i.e. if the app is not resuming from the background, you should be automatically prompted with a list of media servers discovered on the network. If no server is found, use the refresh arrow in the top navigation bar to force a rediscovery.\r\n- Select the media server you want to browse the content.\r\n- Browse the media server content and select a media (music, photo or video) you want to play.\r\n- You should be prompted with a list of media renderers discovered on the network. Note that your device is always present by default. If no remote renderer is found, use the refresh arrow in the top navigation bar to force a rediscovery.\r\n- Select either your device if you want to play the selected media locally, or a remote renderer if you want to play the selected media remotely.\r\n- Enjoy your media.\r\n- Note that at anytime you can change of media server through the settings tab."

When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward. It was so-named in 1967 by English actor Simon Prebble, in honor of his countryman and revolutionary physicist Isaac Newton.\n\nNewton's Cradle is a device that not only demonstrates a pendulum, but also shows the Laws of Conservation of Momentum and Energy. When one ball on the end is lifted and released, the resulting force travels through the line and pushes the last ball upward. Because it uses Newton's Laws, it was named after Sir Isaac Newton, English physicist, mathematician and astronomer.\n\nEach ball acts like an individual pendulum. At rest all the balls are touching. When you lift one of the end balls and let it hit the resting balls, only the ball at the other end moves, and the initial ball stops at rest. \n\n\nThanks for your support and do visit nitrio.com for more apps for your iOS devices."

With 5 Squirrels playing for 7 badges each, that’s a whole lot of Duggee Hugs!\n\nKey Features:\n\n•\tSeven fun activities with a variety of gameplay styles \n•\tDevelop fine motor control skills in the Acorn Badge \n•\tImprove attention skills, reaction times and speech skills in the Food Growing Badge \n•\tPractice counting in the Sheep Badge  \n•\tPromote gross motor control skills in the Raindance Badge \n•\tDevelop concentration and planning skills in the Submarine Badge\n•\tEncourage creativity in the Paper Boat and Sandcastle Badges\n•\tVisit your gallery to see all of your wonderful adventures\n\nGames:\n\nThe Acorn Badge\nSome animals collect acorns to eat through the winter. Use your excellent catching skills to fill your cart with lots of lovely acorns! Look out for those elusive Special Acorns! And be careful not to slip on the banana skins...\n\nThe Food Growing Badge\nShall we grow our own fruit and veg, Squirrels? First, you plant your seed. Next, you cover it with soil. And finally, you give it a lovely big drink of water! You’ll need to protect your plant from pests… and you’ll need to talk to it to help it grow. What green fingers you have!\n\nThe Sheep Badge\nThe sheep are missing? Let’s round them all up! Twist and weave your way through the trees and bushes, picking up sheep as you go. 1 sheep, 2 sheep, 3 sheep… all the way up to 10 sheep! Are you keeping count? \n\nThe Raindance Badge\nA raindance is a dance that people do to try to make it rain! This game will really get you moving. First, you’ll need to learn the steps: Clap, clap, wiggle, jump! Now you know the moves, let’s dance along to the music. Excellent…you’ve made it rain!\n\nThe Submarine Badge\nHow exciting... an underwater adventure! Use your finger to track the bubbles and watch as the submarine follows the trail. Collect a Jazz Fish and it’ll play you a rhythmic tune. See if you can spot the Giant Sea Stallion! \n\nThe Paper Boat Badge\nOh no! The Ants are late for their picnic! Let’s make them a paper boat to get them safely across the pond. Practice your origami with some skillful folding. Once you’ve crafted your paper boat, finish it off with some nautical decorations. Lastly, shout ‘faster!’ and watch your boat speed across the water. \n\nThe Sandcastle Badge\nIt’s the summer holidays and Duggee’s organised a day trip to the beach! Help the Squirrels earn their badge by building a fortress made of sand!  \n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover.

      "label": "This is the Original \"Spider on Hand\" app as seen on Youtube. Beware of imitations.\n\nDo you know anyone who is afraid of spiders? Everyone right? Then this is the perfect magic trick/prank for you.\n\nWatch the trailer video at http://www.mypetboris.com/trailer.htm\n\nMy Pet Boris app is the scariest app for the iPhone. Inspired by Jim Pace's magic trick \"The Web\" where a spider magically appears on the back of your spectator's hand. Bound to get amazing reactions.\n\nThe app uses the idea of \"Augmented Reality\" merging real life objects with computer generated graphics to create a truly frightening effect.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC SPIDER EFFFECT\nYou take a photo of the spectator's palm (secretly loading a plastic spider on the back of their hand) and place the phone on their palm to hold.\n\nYour Pet Boris - an Australian Red back spider (black widow) creeps onto the screen and they can feel the vibrations as it walks. You can tap the screen and even slide your finger into the animation to scratch the spider's back. Boris walks off the screen.\n\nYou tell them that the phone has special sensors that when you wave your hand over the screen it makes the spider come back. He does.\n\nYou get them to wave their hand over the phone. \nIt is just then that they glimpse a realistic spider clinging to the back of their hand and they FREAK OUT!!\n\nBound to get BIG reactions. \n\nFinger tone and size can be set to suit your own or you can import an image of your own finger. \n\nStart-up screen can be customised to suit your performance style. An actual  photo of their hand, solid white or any image from your library can be used as a background.\n\nNOTE: Requires a plastic spider or cockroach and adhesive dots to perform. You should be able to find these locally or you can purchase from our website.\n\nSee our website http://www.mypetboris.com for more details, spider and cockroach supplies and video presentation & instructions.\n\nLike our Facebook page to keep up to date with changes, tips and suggestions. http://www.facebook.com/MyPetBoris\n\n\nTHE MAGIC COCKROACH\nThe app also comes with a cockroach animation for those who think they are scarier than spiders.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC BUTTERFLY EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Butterfly is an additional effect within the Magic Spider – My Pet Boris App. \n\nIt is enabled as an “in app purchase” for around US$2.99 depending on your local currency. The custom finger feature is also unlocked when you purchase the butterfly effect.\n \nThis is a perfect routine for those times when you want to perform a beautiful effect for a little girl or woman, leaving her with a magical gift at the end. You will get similarly strong reactions to the Magic Spider effect without the scare factor.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe magician simulates a grand illusion in the palm of the spectator’s hand. A tiny foil covered “Magical Egg” is placed in the palm of the spectator’s hand and then photographed. The phone is placed on their hand.\n\nThe egg transforms into a Chrysalis and then into a butterfly. The magician’s finger is seen to tickle the virtual butterfly on screen which then flies away. \nUsing a magical gesture the magician brings the butterfly back briefly before it flies off again.\n\nThe spectator is asked to try and make it return. When they try, they find a matching butterfly (in an impossible location) on the back of their hand. The original foil egg has vanished.\n\nTHE CARD REVELATION EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Spider effect with the addition of a torn card corner revelation as a finale.\n\nAccessory packs and supplies are available at: http://www.mypetboris.com/store.htm\n\nSee our FAQ Section. http://www.mypetboris.com/faq.htm\n\nFull instructions at: (everything is explained)\nhttp://www.mypetboris.com/inst2099.htm.\n\nUse the password at the bottom of the \"CREDITS\" screen for access."

Safe, ad-free fun for your little ones.\n\nJoin Duggee and the Squirrels as they work hard to earn seven brand new badges: \n\n•\tCatch the falling acorns; \n•\tGrow your own fruit and veg; \n•\tRound up the missing sheep; \n•\tLearn Duggee’s raindance; \n•\tPilot your submarine in an underwater adventure; \n•\tMake a paper boat to help the ants!\n•\tAnd finally, hit the beach and build a glorious sandcastle.\n\nCompleting each activity earns the Squirrel a badge. With 5 Squirrels playing for 7 badges each, that’s a whole lot of Duggee Hugs!\n\nKey Features:\n\n•\tSeven fun activities with a variety of gameplay styles \n•\tDevelop fine motor control skills in the Acorn Badge \n•\tImprove attention skills, reaction times and speech skills in the Food Growing Badge \n•\tPractice counting in the Sheep Badge  \n•\tPromote gross motor control skills in the Raindance Badge \n•\tDevelop concentration and planning skills in the Submarine Badge\n•\tEncourage creativity in the Paper Boat and Sandcastle Badges\n•\tVisit your gallery to see all of your wonderful adventures\n\nGames:\n\nThe Acorn Badge\nSome animals collect acorns to eat through the winter. Use your excellent catching skills to fill your cart with lots of lovely acorns! Look out for those elusive Special Acorns! And be careful not to slip on the banana skins...\n\nThe Food Growing Badge\nShall we grow our own fruit and veg, Squirrels? First, you plant your seed. Next, you cover it with soil. And finally, you give it a lovely big drink of water! You’ll need to protect your plant from pests… and you’ll need to talk to it to help it grow. What green fingers you have!\n\nThe Sheep Badge\nThe sheep are missing? Let’s round them all up! Twist and weave your way through the trees and bushes, picking up sheep as you go. 1 sheep, 2 sheep, 3 sheep… all the way up to 10 sheep! Are you keeping count? \n\nThe Raindance Badge\nA raindance is a dance that people do to try to make it rain! This game will really get you moving. First, you’ll need to learn the steps: Clap, clap, wiggle, jump! Now you know the moves, let’s dance along to the music. Excellent…you’ve made it rain!\n\nThe Submarine Badge\nHow exciting... an underwater adventure! Use your finger to track the bubbles and watch as the submarine follows the trail. Collect a Jazz Fish and it’ll play you a rhythmic tune. See if you can spot the Giant Sea Stallion! \n\nThe Paper Boat Badge\nOh no! The Ants are late for their picnic! Let’s make them a paper boat to get them safely across the pond. Practice your origami with some skillful folding. Once you’ve crafted your paper boat, finish it off with some nautical decorations. Lastly, shout ‘faster!’ and watch your boat speed across the water. \n\nThe Sandcastle Badge\nIt’s the summer holidays and Duggee’s organised a day trip to the beach! Help the Squirrels earn their badge by building a fortress made of sand!  \n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

Safe ad-free fun for your little ones!\n\nThe Squirrels have been learning how to look after animals... and now it's your turn to have a go! \n\nThere are nine crazy creatures to care for in five lovely locations. Have fun helping them to interact with their surroundings – kites, snowmen, sandcastles, balloons, windmills, a paddling pool, sprouting veg, bouncing pumpkins and lots more.  \n\nWhether it's a chicken, a rabbit, a cat or a hedgehog it'll need to be fed, watered, washed and exercised - not to mention a bit of extra TLC when it's feeling under the weather. \n\nSo keep a watchful eye on your expanding menagerie to make sure your animals have everything they need to make them happy! \n\nKey Features:\n\n•\tAn interactive app that encourages exploratory and open-ended gameplay; \n•\tFive locations to visit: a park, some woods, the beach, the snow and a field; \n•\tNine animals to collect: penguin, monkey, hedgehog, chicken, cat, frog, bird, rabbit and mouse; \n•\tStep by step guide on how to care for the animals; \n•\tPlayers learn to spot what an animal needs to keep it happy: Food, water, exercise, a wash and sometimes a bandage!; \n•\tPlaying the correct mini game gives the animal what they need and earns the player their We Love Animals Badge!\n\nFeeding: Enid the cat looks like she’s a little peckish! See if you can feed her the correct food from the conveyer belt. Give her enough of the food she likes and she’ll be happy again in no time!\n\nDrinking: I think Monkey could do with a drink. Let’s get him some water by connecting the pipes to the water fountain! What a splendid path you’ve chosen, Squirrel!\n\nWashing: How did Mouse get so dirty? She could do with a good wash! First get rid of the leaves… next, cover her in soap… and finally, pop every last one of the soapy bubbles! Excellent cleaning!\n\nExercising: An animal should be exercised daily! Help Norrie and Tag to get your animals skipping and you’ll have them fit and healthy before they know it!\n\nCaring: Frog’s gotten into a scrape! Not to worry… a few bandages in just the right places and he’ll be back to his old self before you can say “Ribbet!”.\n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

      "label": "The toy top that buzzes with sci-fi sounds and glows with limitless, colorful shapes...\n\nBest of iPhone Entertainment in the US and 8 other countries - App Store Rewind 2011\n\nCosmic Top is a toy, a 3D audiovisual physics simulation of a spinning, wobbling, and morphing top.  The top floats among stars and takes on unlimited colorful shapes and sci-fi sounds which glow and hum in stereo from your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch.  Swipe to spin it, pinch to zoom it, or hold to brake it.  If you rotate your device, you can see and hear the top from all sides.  Record your own spin and tumble sounds and then hear both tracks played back in sync with the motion of the top.  Create and share video of your favorite top action.  Edit echo effects, color flow, and spin inertia of each top style.  Best of all, with a touch of the cosmic button, a new cosmos of sight and sound will be created for you to explore.\n\n\n\"Cosmic Top is the first sheer toy I’ve downloaded for my iPad, and I love it… This app is highly recommended.\"\n- 5/5 Outstanding! - John Martellaro, the Mac Observer\n\n\"Cosmic Top is about as much fun as you can imagine on an iPad.\" - 5/5 - Phillip T. Stephens, iPad Envy\n\n\"I have to say Cosmic Top is definitely a game changer… Pick it up and have yourself a little fun and impress your friends.\" - 5/5 - App Safari\n\n\"Seriously Buy This App!\" - iJailBreak\n\n\nFEATURES\n- Realistic physics simulation via Euler's equations for rotating bodies\n- Simple and intuitive multi-touch control with each touch adding to the motion\n- Uses Three-axis gyro\n- Unlimited shapes and sounds generated from randomized mathematical functions providing lots of replay value\n- Fun for both young and old\n\n\nIn no time, the magic of its gyroscopic and kaleidoscopic wheeling, whirring, and whirling will hypnotize you. We hope you enjoy it.\n\n\n\"When you get it spinning really fast, the sounds get crazy excellent!\" - Billy P. Sassafras, 10-Year-Old App Enthusiast\n\n\"Wow! It's like, full of stars. The audiovisual experience is psychedelic… cool…\" - Dr. David Bowman, Hip Fictional Character\n\n\"It is neat to watch the polhode roll without slipping on the herpolhode.\" - Louis Poinsot, French Mechanics Nerd\n\n\nWe read all your reviews and are committed to improve the experience of Cosmic Top with free updates.  Thanks for all the great comments and suggestions."

      "label": "We created a Sound and Light Scape system which is unpredictable (no looping sounds), highly customisable and versatile in it's setup. Hue Haunted House contains high quality audio effects with beautifully synced lighting to create the perfect eerie mood.\n\nHue Haunted House offers the following scary themes to choose from:\n\n- Creepy Cave\nDripping stones, scary bats and ferocious monsters haunt you while you wander through the corridors of this dark cave. Did you take the right turn 10 minutes ago? Sure you are not lost?...\n\n- Grisly Graveyard\nThis is definitely a place where you do not want to be. Zombies stray over this graveyard while rain and wind make you shiver. Or is it the fear in your body? A distant church reminds you you are not far from safety. But why can it's bell be heard so often and irregular? Isn't that odd? \n\n- Demon Dollhouse\nDolls are sweet aren't they? So you would say... This dollhouse is full of evil. So evil, It makes the small dolls cry. Or are they possessed as well? Something is very wrong, that's for sure.\n\n- Eerie Forest\nThis is a spine-chilling forest. Birds give the impression of some peace. But don't be fooled. Weird creatures also roam this place. Is that the wind in the trees you hear? Sounds of raven are never a good sign...\n\n- Frightening Pursuit\nYou're running but it seems you don't progress. What is it you flee from? Not knowing is the worst. But one thing is for sure. You don't want it to catch up with you, then you'll suffer the same faith as that poor little fluffy creature which wasn't fast enough.\n\n- Distressing Dungeon \nLocked up, nobody knows why. Damp and dark you scream for help but the only reaction you get is your own echo. Doors open and close, chains rattle around you. Nobody there to help you out. Will it end here?\n\n- Abandoned Fairground\nThis must be the weirdest place on earth. Fairgrounds look so gruesome when abandoned. Once a place of joy and laugh, now a spooky ground where some machines still try to entertain you as you pass by. Sounds of the past appear out of nothing. As if ghosts and spirits are still on a roller coaster ride. Is that a clown I hear? \n\n- Haunted House\nWhispers around you make your heart beat faster, while you walk through this old house with it's creaky floors and doors. Thunder bursts concentrated above the house making cats and other animals scream. After every door you think you found the exit, but every door leads to another room with new surprises. Most of them not so pleasant. Wish you haven't been so curious and never entered this Haunted House?\n\n- Hell Fire\nWhen you open your eyes from whats seems like a nap, flames warm your body from below. Standing on top of a big rock you look at the bubbling Lava. Where to go? Fireballs shoot all over the place. You see some phantoms who fail to dodge them. Distant screams make the place even more horrific. You can just hope this is a very bad dream.\n\n- Gloomy Ghosts\nHave you ever seen a ghost? Some say they do. But in this place you can hear them for sure. Have a look around, maybe you see or feel them. It's said that if you feel a sudden cold, a ghost might just pass you. Or even fly right through you. Look out! On your left!\n\n- Sinister Strings\nWhen you enter the Opera house, the theater hall is dark and there's nobody on the podium. These instruments seem to play themselves! It's an orchestra without direction. I think there are too many false notes being played here..\n\n- Witch Hunt\nScreeching laughter so typically for witches. A lot of them are gathered to discuss new spells and recipes. The winner of last year's soup competition is already cooking this years soup. The ingredients are gore and not so typical. Make sure you do not end up in the boiling cauldron in the middle of the square.\n\n- Pirate Ship\nArr aaaaaargh. This is not the average pirate ship. This one is haunted. We suspect ghost are glooming around the rudder.\n\n- Lurid Laboratory\nNot Dexter, not DeeDee but evil forces brew here."

      "label": "Amazing magic on the spectators iPhone by World Champion Magician, SOMA. Unlike other magic apps, this trick is not performed on the magician's phone, so the spectator will not assume that a tricky app is involved. City Prediction is a pure miracle performed on the spectator's iPhone in his/her hand. It is so unbelievable it will leave the audience speechless and amazed.\n\n= The effect =\nThe magician asks for the spectator’s iPhone and asks her to open maps.google.com in her browser. After the performer turned it away for a few seconds, he puts it face-down on the table. From this point, nobody will touch the phone but the spectator. First, ​she names a city - it is completely free of choice, no lists or restrictions are involved. Then she turns her iPhone over and surprisingly realizes that the city she named is marked in the previously opened Google Maps.\n\nThe trick is easy to perform, requires minimal setup and practice. The app includes written instructions and a video guide, as well.\n\n= Facts =\n- Works with any iPhone or iPad\n- NO voice recognition used\n- NO force used \n- NO pre-show used\n- Spectator can name virtually ANY city in the world\n- Nothing is installed on the spectator’s device\n- City is marked in Google Maps\n- A brand new method never used in magic before"

Why, a dinosaur roar of course!\n\nTyrannosaurus Rex (or T-Rex, as his friends like to call him) was a carnivorous dinosaur living more than 65 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period (not the Jurassic period, as many people think). Since humans weren’t around when T-Rex roamed the Earth, we are left to speculate what this ancient beast really sounded like. By studying what we know of T-Rex through fossils, and comparing that to what we know of modern animal sounds, we can make some pretty good guesses at T-Rex’s vocal habits. From a bone-chilling roar to a snarl, growl or scream, these sounds are not the kind you want to hear when hiking through the forest, especially if you’re a triceratops or other tasty T-Rex snack!\n\nWhether you want to learn about dinosaur sounds, or simply scare your friends, you’ll love these T-Rex sound recordings!"

      "label": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (US/UK), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly."

      "label": "In the modern age, paranormal investigators use many tools to communicate with spirits. Ouija Boards, Spirit Boxes, radios and apps are just a few of the many tools they use but cultures have been using tools to communicate with spirits for ages. \n\nCleromancy, the practice of contacting divine truth via random castings of dice (or bones) stretches back before recorded history. Astragalomancy, is a form of divination that uses dice marked with letters. In fact, many ancient cultures have various forms of dice divination.\n\nNecro Dice is a modern version of this ancient practice. This app means to combine the ancient and modern forms of communication in a completely new and unique way. Users seeking answers or messages can roll the dice with a simple tap of the screen. Once the user’s intention has been cast through the rolling of the dice, it is up to the spirits to communicate by influencing the randomization of letters to form words. This phenomenon of spirit communication through the manipulation of electronic devices has been well documented for several decades.\n\nNecro Dice functions by generating a handful of dice with random letters assigned to each of the six faces of each dice. These dice are then simulated with an advanced physics engine that handles dice to table and dice to dice collisions. When the physics simulation completes and the dice settle the result is a jumble of letters shown on the top face of the dice. Normally when using dice, the user is then required to inspect the dice to try and find words in this jumble of letters. This app uses a proprietary algorithm to inspect the top faces of the dice and try to match words and names to a dictionary. A word is chosen from the jumble of letters based on many factors including distance, length, location and relevance. Once a word is detected in the dice,  the app will highlight the individual letters on the dice and display the word on the screen. A list of words rolled since the start of the app can be accessed in the word log by pressing the button at the lower left of the screen.\n\nRolling dice isn’t just for games, do the spirits have a message for you?"

      "label": "TV Launcher brings over 100 live UK TV channels that you know and love into one convenient launcher on your iPhone & iPad - perfect for cord-cutters!\n\n\n* As featured on iMore & 9to5Mac *\n\n\nThe Apple TV app makes it easy to track the programmes you’re watching but if you’re still wanting to watch live, you know the score. Open the app, find the channels list, look for the channel you want to watch and then press play. TV Launcher takes away that pain by allowing you to open any of the supported streaming apps directly to the channel.\n\n\nTV Launcher contains these great features:\n\nUK STREAMING PLATFORMS\n\nTV Launcher supports all of the main UK streaming platforms that have live TV and a few more too! You’ll be able to jump straight to channels in BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, My5, NOW (Sky), Discovery+, TalkTV, euronews, France 24, Al Jazeera and Bloomberg. There's also support for quick access to UKTV Play, Pluto TV, DAZN, STV Player and RTÉ Player as well which unfortunately don't support launching channels fully.\n\n\nWIDGETS & SHORTCUTS\n\nYou don’t even have to open TV Launcher to get to the channel you want to watch. With the Widget, you can launch channels directly from your Home Screen and support for Siri Shortcuts means you can watch channels using just your voice!\n\n\nTV GUIDE\n\nChoose to see what's on now and up next or, view a full day's worth of listing so you can decide what to watch before choosing a channel.\n\n\nFAVOURITES\n\nIf you have a select few channels you always like to watch, add them to your favourites list.\n\n\nHIDE CHANNELS\n\nNot interested in the news or don’t have kids? Choose the channels you want to hide and only keep around the ones you’re likely to watch. If you don’t have a streaming app installed, you can hide channels from those too.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNCING\n\nYour favourite channels, hidden channels and other settings all sync via iCloud so if you have multiple devices using TV Launcher, they'll all be kept in sync.\n\n\nREGION\n\nDifferent parts of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland & Northern Ireland) have slight variations to their standard channels. Choose your region in the settings menu and you’ll be shown the channels you expect.\n\n\nORGANISATION\n\nTV Launcher supports many layout configurations so you can organise your channels exactly how you’d like to find them. There’s options like a full list, grouping by app or even by category too.\n\n\nCUSTOMISATION\n\nOnce you’ve organised your channels, choose how to display them with options like the ability to show channel names or group names.\n\n\nSEARCH\n\nIf you can’t find the channel you’re looking for, search for it!\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: support@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note that to watch a selected channel, you will need the respective app installed. TV Launcher cannot be guaranteed to work outside the UK due to the selection of apps available in specific countries. All channels and their respective trademarks are owned by them and this app is not affiliated with them in any way."

Use the search bar to quickly find your minifigures by unique ID, name, or set number. You can swipe between minifigure entries to easily update your collection! Each minifigure page provides all the relevant information you need to know. Saving the best for last, exclusive to the LSW Collector app is a section dedicated to more obscure variants! Entries for all minifigures made from 1999 to current are included and are added in real time which means you don't have to wait for an update to check them off. We promise to continue to update with the newest minifigures so that you can continue expanding your collection! \n\nLSW Collector is an unofficial mobile application for all collectors of LEGO Star Wars minifigures. Made by a collector for collectors!\n\nCapabilities:\n\nEach entry contains all of the important information about the minifigure including detailed images, unique ID, year of release, and in which sets it can be found. Swiping left and right allows you to see both the front and back of the minifigure. Clicking on the sets box shows exactly which sets a minifig comes from! LSW Collector allows you to 'check off' minifigures you already have and add the ones you don't to your wanted list. The green check mark allows you to easily see which minifigures you already have from the main view while the 'WANTED' symbol indicates which figures you are still chasing. Alternatively you can ignore figures that you don't want to have in your collection by tapping on the hide button at the bottom of the screen. You can revisit these figures any time by clicking the hide button on the main page. The Price Guide feature allows you to check the average selling price for each minifigure and can be used as an estimation for your own buying/selling purposes. You can also add multiple of the same minifigure to your collection and then track your total progress on the My Collection tab.\n\nLegal Information:\n\nLEGO and the minifigure are registered trademarks of the LEGO Group.\n\nSTAR WARS is a registered trademark of Lucasfilm, Ltd.

      "label": "The Refreshinator is a web browser that allows you to auto refresh web pages based on a Keyword. Select a keyword / phrase you want to change from the web page, when it disappears or changes, the browser will stop refreshing and sound an Alarm!.\n\nThe Browser Features:\n-Refresh until word or phrase no longer appears on the page (this means you are no longer stuck on the holding page)\n-Auto Detect if page failed to load.\n-Prevent the iPhone or iPad going to sleep\n-Two search methods \n-Refresh until word Appears \n-Refresh until word Disappears / changes\n-Change the refresh speed.\nExample uses:\n- Sales sites: Get an advantage with sneaker sales, new exclusive phone sales and clothing sales.  Sometimes you need to keep refreshing a website just before a sale starts, choose a keyword or phrase like ‘currently unavailable’ and the app will keep refreshing until the word disappears, i.e the sale is on. This can give you the vital seconds required to purchase / cop that exclusive sales item.  \n\n- Ticketing sites: will often keep you in a queue on a web page known as a ‘holding page’, on some sites refreshing this page can get you through to the purchase page. This is where The Refreshinator helps, More refreshes = More chances of a ticket. When you are stuck on a \"holding page\", The Refreshinator can be set to automatically refresh the holding page until you get onto the purchase area. As each refresh is a chance, the speed you refresh the page counts Increases your chances. The Refreshinator can do this faster than a person and can drastically improve your chances of getting through a ticket queue. The App was used to purchase tickets in the Glastonbury ticket sale and Glastonbury Resale, it get through to the purchase area over ten times in an average of 30 seconds. Once in 3 seconds.\n\n- Chat rooms / sports sites:  Some sites do not refresh when updates occur, you can set the Refreshinator to Refresh a site until a a game finishes or a chat group updates, in these scenarios we recommend using a a refresh rate of 5 - 15 seconds as updates are not so frequent.\n\n- Job listings, some site put up job listing at a given point of time however watching and refreshing the site continuously is a chore. Just put in the key word or phrase and set the app to keep refreshing until the listing appears."

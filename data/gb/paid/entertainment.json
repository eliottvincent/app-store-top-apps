Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children. Parents have the option to limit screen time for their kids: after a chosen time, the kitten gets tired and goes to sleep.\nLittle Kitten is a high-tech app - using the latest 3d animation technology to create the visuals, it also uses cutting edge programming to maximize the user experience on your apple device. Enjoy the premium quality content in this original app brought to you by Squeakosaurus.

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

With 5 Squirrels playing for 7 badges each, that’s a whole lot of Duggee Hugs!\n\nKey Features:\n\n•\tSeven fun activities with a variety of gameplay styles \n•\tDevelop fine motor control skills in the Acorn Badge \n•\tImprove attention skills, reaction times and speech skills in the Food Growing Badge \n•\tPractice counting in the Sheep Badge  \n•\tPromote gross motor control skills in the Raindance Badge \n•\tDevelop concentration and planning skills in the Submarine Badge\n•\tEncourage creativity in the Paper Boat and Sandcastle Badges\n•\tVisit your gallery to see all of your wonderful adventures\n\nGames:\n\nThe Acorn Badge\nSome animals collect acorns to eat through the winter. Use your excellent catching skills to fill your cart with lots of lovely acorns! Look out for those elusive Special Acorns! And be careful not to slip on the banana skins...\n\nThe Food Growing Badge\nShall we grow our own fruit and veg, Squirrels? First, you plant your seed. Next, you cover it with soil. And finally, you give it a lovely big drink of water! You’ll need to protect your plant from pests… and you’ll need to talk to it to help it grow. What green fingers you have!\n\nThe Sheep Badge\nThe sheep are missing? Let’s round them all up! Twist and weave your way through the trees and bushes, picking up sheep as you go. 1 sheep, 2 sheep, 3 sheep… all the way up to 10 sheep! Are you keeping count? \n\nThe Raindance Badge\nA raindance is a dance that people do to try to make it rain! This game will really get you moving. First, you’ll need to learn the steps: Clap, clap, wiggle, jump! Now you know the moves, let’s dance along to the music. Excellent…you’ve made it rain!\n\nThe Submarine Badge\nHow exciting... an underwater adventure! Use your finger to track the bubbles and watch as the submarine follows the trail. Collect a Jazz Fish and it’ll play you a rhythmic tune. See if you can spot the Giant Sea Stallion! \n\nThe Paper Boat Badge\nOh no! The Ants are late for their picnic! Let’s make them a paper boat to get them safely across the pond. Practice your origami with some skillful folding. Once you’ve crafted your paper boat, finish it off with some nautical decorations. Lastly, shout ‘faster!’ and watch your boat speed across the water. \n\nThe Sandcastle Badge\nIt’s the summer holidays and Duggee’s organised a day trip to the beach! Help the Squirrels earn their badge by building a fortress made of sand!  \n\nCustomer Care:\nIf you experience any technical issues with this app please get in touch.

The spectator  just by looking at a slideshow and you can guess or force several images in the same performance while you have your back to the audience.    “ True mentalism”\n\n—NO INTERNET connection needed.\n—Intuitive and super easy to learn and perform.\n—Fully customizable, create your own photo album and share it with other users. \n\nImpossible right? what the spectator  doesn't know and will never suspect is that while watching a slideshow from the iphone photo gallery, Photopsia app is analyzing their face, detecting when the spectator closes or opens their eyes, ruling out blinking. \n\n\n\"Phenomenal magic app with lots of potentials, using mindblowing technology.\" - Benke Smith \n\n“Never thought that something like that is possible… PHOTOPSIA broke all the limits”  alexandru miclea ( administrator group facebook magic apps)\n\n“A wicked clever app with ingenious input methods that will blow people’s minds. \nFirst impressions.. Just amazing!! “ - Shameer Salim\n\n\nHere are some features where you can create your own routines:\n\nForced feature\nWith this feature you will be able to force one or several items (image). In the case of not adding any image as force, you will only be able to do the peek. ( guessing the last image the spectator saw by closing their eyes to focus on the details of that image)\n\nWhen the spectator closes his eyes Photopsia app recognizes the image that is displayed just at the moment of closing his eyes.\n\nWhen the Spectator opens his eyes, the image selected in the settings will be shown as forced, this can be repeated with one or more images from the same album and even without leaving the performance, choose another album to perform the same or another effect.\n\nMatch force feature\n\nIt is often used as a match between two spectator\n\nFirst spectator select freely an item (when eyes close) to automatically become the force item when the second spectator ( parnet) open the eye.\n\nDual Force\n It allows you to force an item depending on the item chosen freely by one spectator\n\nEach image (item) is paired with another, depending on the one the spectator chooses freely when closing his eyes, when the spectator opens them ,the first image he will see will be the forced image that is paired with the chosen one freely when he closes his eye before"

      "label": "TV Launcher brings over 100 live UK TV channels that you know and love into one convenient launcher on your iPhone & iPad - perfect for cord-cutters!\n\n\n* As featured on iMore & 9to5Mac *\n\n\nThe Apple TV app makes it easy to track the programmes you’re watching but if you’re still wanting to watch live, you know the score. Open the app, find the channels list, look for the channel you want to watch and then press play. TV Launcher takes away that pain by allowing you to open any of the supported streaming apps directly to the channel.\n\n\nTV Launcher contains these great features:\n\nUK STREAMING PLATFORMS\n\nTV Launcher supports all of the main UK streaming platforms that have live TV and a few more too! You’ll be able to jump straight to channels in BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, My5, NOW (Sky), Discovery+, TalkTV, euronews, France 24, Al Jazeera and Bloomberg. There's also support for quick access to UKTV Play, Pluto TV, DAZN, STV Player and RTÉ Player as well which unfortunately don't support launching channels fully.\n\n\nWIDGETS & SHORTCUTS\n\nYou don’t even have to open TV Launcher to get to the channel you want to watch. With the Widget, you can launch channels directly from your Home Screen and support for Siri Shortcuts means you can watch channels using just your voice!\n\n\nTV GUIDE\n\nChoose to see what's on now and up next or, view a full day's worth of listing so you can decide what to watch before choosing a channel.\n\n\nFAVOURITES\n\nIf you have a select few channels you always like to watch, add them to your favourites list.\n\n\nHIDE CHANNELS\n\nNot interested in the news or don’t have kids? Choose the channels you want to hide and only keep around the ones you’re likely to watch. If you don’t have a streaming app installed, you can hide channels from those too.\n\n\nICLOUD SYNCING\n\nYour favourite channels, hidden channels and other settings all sync via iCloud so if you have multiple devices using TV Launcher, they'll all be kept in sync.\n\n\nREGION\n\nDifferent parts of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland & Northern Ireland) have slight variations to their standard channels. Choose your region in the settings menu and you’ll be shown the channels you expect.\n\n\nORGANISATION\n\nTV Launcher supports many layout configurations so you can organise your channels exactly how you’d like to find them. There’s options like a full list, grouping by app or even by category too.\n\n\nCUSTOMISATION\n\nOnce you’ve organised your channels, choose how to display them with options like the ability to show channel names or group names.\n\n\nSEARCH\n\nIf you can’t find the channel you’re looking for, search for it!\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: support@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note that to watch a selected channel, you will need the respective app installed. TV Launcher cannot be guaranteed to work outside the UK due to the selection of apps available in specific countries. All channels and their respective trademarks are owned by them and this app is not affiliated with them in any way."

      "label": "Do you enjoy watching videos on your iPhone? Do you hate not being able to because your iPhone cannot support the video format? Or do you hate the inconvenient and time-consuming hassle of trying to convert video formats to fit into one that your iPhone can support? \nThis is why the AVPlayer was created. The AVPlayer can play almost any computer video file format such as AVI, Xvid, WMV and much more clearly and effortlessly. No converting hassles. Just copy files via USB and just drag and drop into the AVPlayer’s Media Explorer. \nThe AVPlayer can also support external subtitle files such as SMI and SRT. So if you enjoy watching videos on your iPad, then the AVPlayer is an absolute necessity. \n\n• Support Formats\n- Dolby Digital (AC3), Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3)\n- Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- MP4,MOV,M4V\n- XVID,AVI,WMV,RMVB,ASF,H264,MKV… most of all movie file formats. \n- SMI, SRT, TXT, SubStationAlpha Subtitles \n\n• Post Processing \n- High quality video processing \n- Contrast,Saturation,Brightness \n- TV-Out \n\n• Control the playback speed (From 0.5X to 2.0X) \n- User setting support \n- Sweep to the left : move to backword 10 sec \n- Sweep to the right : move to forward 10 sec \n- Sweep to the top : 1.5X speed \n- Sweep to the down : normal speed \n\n• Additional features \n- Rotation Lock / Aspect ratio:auto/16:9/4:3/Full screen \n- Folder Management:Pass code/Move/Rename/Create \n- Resume play from last position \n- Scrubbing search \n- supports e-mail attachment by \"Open In\" feature \n\n• USB/WIFI Transfer \n\n• Note \n1. How to add video with USB \n- Run iTunes 9.1 or above \n- Device->My Device(My iPad)->Apps, drag and drop files to the AVplayer's documents \n\n2. Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal."

On top of that our soundscape apps use a unique and simple to use occurrence slider to let you decide how often a specific bird or other sound is used in the preset. Still it's totally unpredictable when a specific sound is being heard therefore producing an amazingly natural sound experience. It can run for hours on end without getting repetitive like other sound engines do. \n\nChoose from the following thunder presets and themes:\n\nThunder presets:\n- Light drizzle.\n- On a rainy day.\n- Heavy rain pours down.\n- Light thunder storm.\n- Inside the thunder storm.\n- Heavy thunder storm.\n- Tornado Alley.\n- Hurricane mayhem.\n\nThunder Ambient presets:\n- A damp rain forest.\n- At the beach after a warm day.\n- Staring out the window in a busy city.\n- A walk in the city under the umbrella.\n- Bad weather camping at the lake.\n- Storm over NYC.\n- After the storm.\n- In the car.\n- Bike ride through Amsterdam.\n\nThe following elements can be altered during playback:\n- Sky brightness.\n- Sky On/Off\n- Thunder brightness.\n- Thunder occurrence.\n- Environment volume.\n- Thunder volume.\n\nOther features:\n- Bluetooth and Airplay supported with delay compensation.\n- Sleep timer to safely fall asleep with a stormy fading background. Lights turn off after sleeptimer is finished.\n\n (Hue Thunder also works without Philips Hue, but obviously without light effects)."

Adapted from the hugely successful books, the images are very interesting to babies, even if they seem simple to adults. Babies' vision is quite blurred for the first few weeks so strong contrasting shapes are the best. \n\nTake care to see how baby responds to the images. Lower the brightness and if baby tries to turn away, now might not be the best moment, so try later. New babies are all different, they can tire easily, but will still have favourites. Enjoy discovering which your babies likes with this great app."

      "label": "Endless RPG is a random dungeon and adventure generator for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons and 1st Edition Pathfinder roleplaying games.\n\nThe Random Dungeon Generator is not a game. It is is a tool for playing pen-and-paper role-playing games alone, in a small group without a dungeon master, or with a dungeon master as either a standalone adventure or an easy way to get into the game.  \n\n*** D&D 5TH EDITION OR PATHFINDER 1E ***\n\nThe two most popular tabletop roleplaying systems are supported.  All standard bestiary is included for Pathfinder 1st edition, and D&D support includes the Tomb of Foes and Volo's Guide. These additional monster manuals can be turned on or off in settings, allowing you to customize the dungeon based on the books you own.\n\n*** PLAY SOLO OR IN A GROUP WITHOUT A DM ***\n\nThe Random Dungeon Generator allows you to explore a randomly-generated dungeon through a fog-of-war discovery system with encounters, traps, tricks and treasures shown as you encounter them.  This is perfect for solo play or groups without a dungeon master.\n\n*** GAMEMASTER TOOLS ***\n\nCustom Dungeons allow you to pick the CR level, environment (dungeon, cave, etc.) and enemy (orcs, undead, demons, etc.) and can generate a single level or multiple level dungeons.  \n\nYou can even email the map to yourself complete with a legend so that you can use the randomly generated dungeon offline or import into third-party software.\n\n*** CUSTOMIZE YOUR MAPS! ***\n\nAs a DM, you have a variety of tools to customize the maps.  This includes editing encounters, adding or deleting monsters, editing treasure, adding items, moving traps or setting custom messages for your players, which can allow you to add custom events or traps.\n\n*** MULTIPLE DUNGEON TYPES AND MULTI-LEVELS ***\n\nThe missions created by Endless RPG can encompass different types of 'dungeons' including caves, ruins, strongholds or the classic dungeon.  The missions can also be on a single level or multiple levels mixing and matching the dungeon types, so you can explore a cave that leads to ruins or a stronghold with a dungeon below it.\n\n*** EXPORT TO VIRTUAL TABLETOPS (ROLL20, ETC) OR FOR OFFLINE USE ***\n\nThe DM Mode allows you to email the map of the dungeon level, which can help when trying to use the dungeon in Roll20 or other virtual tabletops or simply playing offline.  You can email a legend with the map that will show all encounters, treasures, etc.  You can also view the map full screen in order to take a screenshot.\n\n*** QUICK BATTLE AND BATTLE MAPS FOR COMBAT MANAGEMENT***\n\nThe app aids in keeping track of hit points with characters on the screen while exploring.  When encountering creatures, the player has a choice of simply clearing the encounter (the monsters will be considered defeated), utilizing a Quick Combat mode, which is perfect on smartphones or for quick battles with 1 or 2 creatures, or a full Battle Map, which allows a more tactical way of resolving combat.\n\n*** SUPPORTS UP TO 8 CHARACTERS ***\n\nPlayers can run through the dungeon as a single character or a party of up to eight characters.  A \"character\" can also include guard dogs, guard bears, or other non-standard creatures.  \n\n*** EXPERIENCE AND LOOT TABLES ***\n\nThe app will keep track of the monsters you have killed, including the over experience points and experience points by character.  It will also track the treasure (magic items, coins, etc.) you have looted on your adventure.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nArt by Raymond E.

But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times.

HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

Another option would be to use HealthExport Remote to access your data remotely from your computer.\n\nHealthExport Remote lets you visualize your health data on a customizable dashboard accessible from a browser on your computer. You can also perform remote CSV exports on the website. Health data is automatically synced to the service multiple times per day in the background, so there is no need for opening the app on your phone anymore. The data is end to end encrypted between your phone and your browser, thus nobody except you can read it. Note that HealthExport Remote requires a monthly subscription payment due to monthly fees associated with running the service.\n\nHealth data types are divided into three categories:\n1. Aggregation based types (e.g step count)\n2. Record based types (e.g body mass)\n3. Workouts and workout routes\n\nAggregation based types can be exported with aggregation by hours, days, or months. The export of record based types contains all entries from the Health app.\n\nHealth Export is compatible with the Shortcut app, thus you can integrate your health data into any automated workflow.\n\nI think your privacy is very important, thus I do not collect any of your health data and I do not share your health data with any analytics provider.\n\n-----------------------------\nAggregated data types:\n-----------------------------\nActivity:\n- Apple Watch stand hours\n- Distance cycling\n- Distance downhill snow sports\n- Distance swimming\n- Distance walking / running\n- Exercise time\n- Flights Climbed\n- Stand time\n- Step count\n- Swimming stroke count\n\nEnergy:\n- Active energy burned\n- Basal energy burned\n\nHeart rate:\n- Heart rate\n- Resting heart rate\n- Walking heart rate\n\nNutrition:\n- Caffeine\n- Calcium\n- Carbohydrates\n- Cholesterol\n- Energy consumed\n- Fat saturated\n- Fat total\n- Fiber\n- Iron\n- Potassium\n- Protein\n- Sodium\n- Sugar\n- Vitamin A\n- Vitamin C\n- Vitamin D\n- Water\n\nWheelchair:\n- Distance wheelchair\n- Wheelchair push count\n\n-----------------------------\nRecord based data types:\n-----------------------------\nAudio exposure:\n- Environmental sound levels\n- Headphone sound levels\n\nBlood:\n- Blood glucose\n- Blood pressure (Diastolic)\n- Blood pressure (Systolic)\n- Insulin delivery\n\nBody:\n- 6 minute walk test\n- Alcoholic beverages\n- Body fat percentage\n- Body mass\n- Body mass index\n- Body temperature\n- Handwashing\n- Height\n- Lean body mass\n- Mindfulness\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Respiratory rate\n- Sleep: Time asleep\n- Sleep: Time in bed\n- Tooth brushing\n- VO2 Max\n- Waist circumference\n- Walking steadiness\n- Walking steadiness notification\n\nHeart rate:\n- Event: High heart rate\n- Event: Irregular heart rhythm\n- Event: Low heart rate\n- Heart rate\n- Heart rate variability (SDNN)\n- Resting heart rate\n- Walking heart rate\n\nReproductive health:\n- Basal body temperature\n- Cervical mucus quality\n- Intermenstrual bleeding\n- Menstrual flow\n- Ovulation test result\n- Pregnancy test\n- Progesterone test\n- Sexual activity\n\n-----------------------------\n\nAccessibility should be an important part of every application.

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

The DQS Mobile app was designed to make it as easy as possible to calculate a Diet Quality Score each day.\n\nAs you eat throughout the day, enter the servings of each category of food that you consume. Tap a box to consume one serving of that category, tap it again and it will become a half serving, and one more tap will set it back to zero for that box. You can tap the category name to view an explanation of what foods fall under that category. Your total DQS score for the day is shown in the upper right corner of the page.  DQS data is saved for each day you track it. \n\nYou can also log your weight and body fat % on the bottom of the Tracking page. We recommend you log your weight no more than once per week.\n\nThe Graphs page lets you see how you are doing with your Diet Quality Score over time. You can view your data over the last week, month or year. When viewing yearly data, it is displayed as 52 week-long averages. You can view graphs showing your total DQS, your weight, or your DQS score by specific category.\n\nYou can set a target weight, body fat % and a target DQS score on the Profile page."

That you are done drinking! My app does not have a reset button or a way to add a drink. ;-> \n\n2. That you are interested in seeing the most important thing, a running total as time goes by that you are not drinking.\n\nGood-Luck!"

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

      "label": "Challenge yourself with the ultimate fitness test on Apple Watch and iPhone.\n\nA beep test is a 20m shuttle run and is based on the timings first described by Luc Léger. Starting at 8.0 km/h and increases by 0.5 km/h roughly every minute. It is an awesome way of testing your cardio fitness out, and working out what your VO2 max is.\n\nWhen you press start you immediately begin the beep test symbolised by a sound and haptic that plays on your watch. Beep Test Watch was designed with haptics in mind and vibrates differently to indicate a level increase. The app will also track your heart rate and active energy and then create a new workout in Apple Health, so you don't have to start a workout at the same time.

This assessment is to ensure you have a suitable fitness level to become a police officer. It involves taking part in a bleep test and dynamic strength test.\n\nJOB RELATED FITNESS TEST:\nAs from September 2013, every police officer in the country  required to undertake personal safety training will also be required to pass an annual fitness assessment. Don't be caught off guard. Make sure you're already at the required standard!\n\nThis app is aimed to assist training for the UK police fitness test but may also be relevant for other UK and foreign public service fitness assessments.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\"Bleeping good. Very easy to use. Good for building up my fitness\" \n5 stars - UK\n\n\"Nice app to have whilst training for my specials assessment in a couple of weeks\"\n5 stars - UK\n\n---------------------------------\n\nBLEEP TEST:\nBeep tests are split into a number of different levels, with a number of beeps at each level. The minimum requirement for police officers in England and Wales is level 5.4 (i.e. level 5, 4 beeps). The total running time for this is about 3 minutes and 40 seconds. In Scotland the level is set at between 9.2 and 6.10, dependent on you age.\n\nThe 15m bleep test featured in this app is identical to the audio track published by the Collage of Policing and is the audio track you will hear on the day of your fitness assessment.\n\n\nPUSH/PULL STRENGTH TEST:\nThe push/pull dynamic strength test is used to measure your strength. This test involves performing five seated chest pushes and five seated chest pulls on a machine called a 'dyno'. To pass this test you need to pull on average at least 35kg and push on average at least 34kg."

      "label": "“Worked great for his bedtime—the look on his face was so calmed.” Christi (mother of 3 week old)\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher is a soothing sounds machine to calm & stop baby crying cycle\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher App is a revolutionary new tool for parents that will calm baby easily using soothing sounds. This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.  This sleepmatic app works like magic for the crying baby and helps parenting so much easier as baby calmer. \r\n\r\nAfter more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, having sudden and long crying baby issues, we came up with the following very valuable feature list of baby soothing sound.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Safe and easy to use baby calming sounds machine. \r\n- Much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.\r\n- Perfectly works for hours in the background and when the phone is locked\r\n- Adjustable Shush baby sound Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)\r\n- Automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby crying volume.\r\n- Shush sounds played in low light “dark mode” ( night mode) to avoid extra mobile light as baby sleeps.\r\n- Work in other Apps on your Phone while still using the Baby Shusher App.\r\n\r\n*Note: Turn your phone on silent/mute to let the app do its magic.*\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat Real Moms are Saying About the Baby Shusher:\r\n\r\n“I wish I would have known about this sooner. It is truly a miracle for me and baby to have a good night’s rest together!” Mercedes (mother of 3 months old)\r\n\r\n“It is a must try for yourself.” Isabel (mother of 3.5 months old)\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t sure after the 1st time I used it, but it proved to us that it worked better and better thereafter. Loved the product!” Erika (mother of 2 months old)\r\n\r\n“The Baby Shusher works to calm a fussy baby.” Vanessa (mother of 2 week old)\r\n\r\n“When used at the night time, it can greatly help calm your baby long enough to help him with whatever’s upsetting him, or calm him down so he can fall asleep or feed.” Ingrid (mother of 1 week old)\r\n\r\n“Thank you! The three most peaceful nights and days in a while.” Mercedes (mother of 3 month old)\r\n\n\r\nYou can also try our other baby shusher - Sleep Miracle products here: \r\nhttps://babyshusher.com/\r \n\r\nGet this paid baby shusher app now to make your parenting life easier. \r\nWe would appreciate your reviews and rating about our app so we can make it better for you.\r\n\r\nYou can also write to us at app@babyshusher.com"

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

      "label": "Health CSV Importer is the easiest, fastest, and most reliable way to import your CSV data into Apple Health. The import logic has been battle-tested with millions of data points and will support almost any CSV you throw at it. Health CSV Importer supports all quantity data types in Apple Health, except Activity Summaries, Stand Hours, Exercise Time, and Nike Fuel.\n\nTo see how easy it is, just watch the preview video (no sound). Note: while we use iCloud Drive in the preview video, iCloud Drive does not need to be enabled in order to perform an import. If you would prefer not to use iCloud Drive, just send the CSV to yourself in Mail.app and open it with Health CSV Importer.\n\nHealth CSV Importer integrates with the HealthKit framework and Health.app to import your CSV files.\n\n◆ What can I import? ◆\n\n‣ Data files from your doctor\n‣ Data from a 3rd-party health device (e.g. blood glucose monitor)\n‣ Health data you’re manually tracking in a spreadsheet (e.g. weight) \n‣ Data from another phone.\n‣ And more!\n\n◆ Features ◆\n\n‣ Fast, quick, efficient, and battle-tested—import your CSV data in just a few seconds.\n‣ Supports all Apple Health quantity data types.\n‣ Smart assignment of data types based on column headers (i.e., no manual assignment of data types to columns!)\n\n◆ Help and Support ◆\n\nIf you run into an issue, please email our team at support@lionheartsw.com. We've helped many customers import their data successfully and will try our best to help you too.\n\nTwo optional, auto-renewing Tip Jar subscriptions are available for $0.49 per month or $4.99 per year (pricing varies by territory). Payments will be charged to your iTunes Account after confirmation. Subscriptions are automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the subscription period. Accounts will be charged for subscription renewals within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

      "label": "Whether you're a competitive lifter or just want to improve your strength and fitness, your one-rep max (1RM) is an essential tool. Calculate your max safely and easily, and then track it over time, on any lift with our easy-to-use calculator!\n\nIn the simplest terms, your 1RM is the amount of weight you can lift for one rep on any given lift. In general, it’s good to know your max for key lifts like the squat, bench press, and deadlift, but your 1RM is critical even if you never plan to train that heavy.\n\nMany lifting programs are designed with a percent of your rep max in mind, and may call for something like using 65% of your 1RM for a given exercise. When you see that, you have to either test for your 1RM or estimate it. Testing your 1RM can be pretty intense, and it requires a high degree of caution to avoid injury.\n\nFortunately, you can estimate your 1RM without testing it! Exercise scientists have devised a formula that's fairly accurate for most people, which is what powers this calculator. Our calculator makes it easy to calculate and track your 1RM and multiple percentages of it for every lift in the book!\n\nFeatures:\n\n· Calculate your 1RM and percentages\n\n· Choose from a variety of lifts (deadlift, bench press, squat, etc.), or add your own\n\n· Track and chart your 1RM history for each type of lift\n\n· Add notes each time you calculate your 1RM\n\n· Improve your weight training with articles by Bodybuilding.com experts\n\n· Choose imperial or metric system\n\n· Incredibly easy to use!"

      "label": "Reprogramming your Self is an App for daily use in order to step out of the circle of constantly repeating your past and consciously creating a new state of being – thus creating a new future, of course! We keep creating the future constantly and in every single second with our thoughts and feelings as well as with our beliefs and perceptions.\n\nWith the morning meditation you will get yourself into a coherent state of alpha or theta brainwaves. In those states you will be far more susceptible for suggestions. Your brain will be recalibrated automatically when you do this meditation of open space and you can gear your new Self-consciously towards the new day.\nDuring your evening meditation you will get into the present moment and linger in the emptiness of quantum space. As the observer you allow the day to pass by as you become an awareness of possibilties. In that state you will create the next day, your future.\n\nUse the meditation for changing your perceptions and beliefs to move into a new state of being. You will do this by marrying a clear intention with a higher emotion. This App will provide you with a range of options in order to get focussed on a specific goal.\nWe are able to influence any condition as well as our outside reality using our mind alone simply by changing our old beliefs and patterns and our perceptions of ourselves and our environment.\n\nThis App contains:\n- Morning meditation\n- Evening meditation\n- Meditation for changing your convictions and beliefs about yourself\n- Capacity to write down your goals\n- Mapping your results daily\n- Evaluation and statistics\n- Background information for changing your beliefs and perceptions\n\nNote: The Meditations are the same as on the CD or MP3-Download \"You are the Placebo #2\".We have split the Meditations in the App for a easier daily use into Morning, Evening and Changing Beliefs-Meditation."

Place it on the start line and press Start. Pro Starter will call out clear commands of a normal athletic Start Sequence.\n\nThe start sequence is: “On Your Marks”, “Set”, and Pistol fire.\n\nYou control the timed gaps between the commands using the stretch ribbon control in the middle of the screen.\n\nUnder “Settings” you can also enable “Gun Variance”. This will vary the time between “Set” and the pistol fire. The variance will help you practice for races when starters are inconsistent at competitions.\n\nAlso under \"Settings\", you can turn on the Flash. The phones Flash/Torch will turn on during the starting sequence and on GO! it will turn off. A coach or timekeeper can then see how you reacted and time from the finish line."

Wonder why her desire for physical intimacy is high one day, then bottomed-out the next? \n\nThere will be no more guessing when you use the Female Forecaster App. \n\nThis new app for boyfriends and husbands lets you know what your sweetheart's moods, libido, energy level and more will be every day.\n\nAnd, it all comes down to where she is in her monthly cycle. \n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\n\nAs three key hormones (estrogen, testosterone and progesterone) rise and fall throughout a woman's monthly cycle, research shows they impact her brain and body in a wide variety of ways.\n\nBecause her hormones repeat the same up and down pattern every cycle, the effects her hormones have on her also repeat the same way cycle after cycle--making her moods, libido, energy and more easy to predict.\n\nFor example...\n\n• On Day 7 of a woman's hormone cycle, she's happier, energetic and experiencing a spike in her sex drive thanks to rising estrogen--making this a day when boyfriends and husbands can do no wrong.\n\n• On Day 19, she's quieter, sluggish and her desire for physical intimacy is low due to sedating progesterone, which is a hormone that reins in sexual desire--so men shouldn't take her \"Not tonight, dear\" personally.\n\n• On Day 27, a drop in estrogen can make her irritable and blue, but she also experiences a rise in libido--which explains why she can be cross with you one minute, but want to cuddle with you the next.\n\nRead full sample forecasts from this app at MyHormonology.com/female-forecaster/sample-days\n\n\nHOW TO USE THE APP\n\nSetting it up takes seconds: Simply input two pieces of information about your girlfriend or wife to launch the app's cycle calendar:\n\n• The typical length of her menstrual cycle (input 28 days if you don't know)\n• The day she's on in her cycle right now (just ask her--her Day 1 is the first day of her most recent period and she just counts from there)\n\nYou can then read your Female Forecast for today or look at any point in the future--tomorrow, next week, next month, even next year--to find out what she'll be like then. \n\n\nAPP BONUSES\n\nThis app also allows you to...\n\n• Get alerts about key days in her cycle (for instance, when her premenstrual week is arriving)\n• Create custom alerts\n• Keep notes\n• Get date ideas and tips for getting on her good side\n\n\nWHO THIS APP IS FOR\n\nMale partners of women who have\n• Healthy menstrual cycles\n• Menstrual cycles lasting anywhere from 22 to 49 days (it's okay if her cycle length varies from month to month)\n• Natural hormones (no hormone birth control)\n\nThis app is not intended for partners of women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, menopausal, taking hormone medications or hormone birth control or have a health disorder that impacts hormones, such as PCOS.\n\nThis app is not intended to help users and their partners avoid pregnancy or become pregnant.\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nIf you're experiencing any problem with this app, I want to know. My team and I work quickly to fix issues and provide updates to ensure you get the most out of your experience. Send your feedback to Gabrielle@MyHormonology.com."

Your Moon Center shifted! \n\nMy Moon Map™ tracks your moods and emotional pattern using the ancient yogic science of the Moon Centers. \n\nWhat are the Moon Centers? Every woman has eleven Moon Centers in the physical body. The Moon Centers are: Arcline, Eyebrows, Cheeks, Lips, Earlobes, Back of the Neck, Breasts, Navel, Vagina, Clitoris, and Inner Thighs. Energy stays at each Moon Center stays for 2.5 days, or 60 hours. Then the energy moves to another Moon Center. Only one Moon Center is active at a time. \n\nEach Moon Center has a mood or emotion associated with it. By tracking your Moon Centers, you are tracking your moods. As your mood changes, your Moon Center changes. \n\nIn one month, you will experience all 11 Moon Centers in your personalized pattern. Your pattern doesn’t change every month – you have the same pattern your entire life. \n\nMy Moon Map™ allows you to map your Moon Center pattern so you can take charge of your emotions. If you know when you will feel bright and outgoing, or insecure and depressed, you can plan your life accordingly. \n\nExperience the depth of your power and use the Moon Center energy to improve your life.  It’s time to meet your Moon Centers! \n\nHow to Use My Moon Map™\n\nEvery two days, open the app and select which mood best describes how you are feeling. Select the date and time. Tune into your energy and notice how you feel and act for those two days. \n\nContinue mapping your pattern for one month until all 11 Moon Centers are selected. Save your Moon Map each month and compare your selections. You will gain a supreme sensitivity and awareness of your energy field and will learn how to direct the lunar force to serve you.  \n\nTracking the Moon Centers takes about one year. You need to go through all four seasons to experience the seasonal expression of each Moon Center. \n\nOnce you map your Moon Center pattern, infinite energy is available to you.  \n\nTerms of Use: https://www.mymoonmap.com/terms-of-use \n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.mymoonmap.com/privacy-policy"

Once you’ve spent a bit of time setting up your preferences and understanding the information iOB displays, we hope it’ll prove to be a valuable tool in making decisions on when and how much insulin to take.\n\nYou can record both long acting (basal) and short acting (bolus) doses, and schedule notifications to remind you when the injections were taken, when they're going to expire and even schedule a dose for sometime in the future.\n\nEntries can be saved to the iPhone’s calendar and you can call up a report to show average doses that have been recorded.\n\niOB is meant to help you work out how much insulin you have on-board and avoid stacking your insulin too much or knowing what kind of ‘top-up’ you could need.\n\nIf you don’t understand insulin on-board or splitting doses please talk you your diabetic clinic or diabetes specialist nurse before using this app.\n\n** iOB is not intended as a way to recommend how much insulin to take, only help you come to a decision. You must take insulin based on your experience, current circumstances and what you have been told by your clinic.\n\n*** iOB cannot magically tell you how much insulin is actually active in your body and is meant only for information purposes.\n\nDo not ignore how you feel!"

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

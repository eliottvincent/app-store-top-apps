      "label": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance.

HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling.

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

This means that the speed will steadily increase as the test progresses.\n\nFEATURES: \n» 15m bleep test \n» Treadmill support \n» Support for Apple Watch\n» Support for both MPH and KPH\n» Edit your personal target score \n» View your average, best and last bleep test score\n» Graphical representation of your test history \n» Clean and easy to use interface \n\nHow it works: \nBleep tests are split into a number of different levels, with a number of beeps at each level. For example, the requirement for police officer candidates in England and Wales is to reach level 5.4 (i.e. level 5, four beeps). The total running time for this is about 3 minutes and 40 seconds. \n\nBleep test is a commonly used term for shuttle run, multistage fitness test and beep test."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customization ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customize your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturizers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturized with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of aging.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organizer\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand."

You can also perform remote CSV exports on the website. Health data is automatically synced to the service multiple times per day in the background, so there is no need for opening the app on your phone anymore.

Aggregation based types (e.g step count)\n2. Record based types (e.g body mass)\n3. Workouts and workout routes\n\nAggregation based types can be exported with aggregation by minutes, hours, days, months, or years. The export of record based types contains all entries from the Health app.\n\nHealth Export is compatible with the Shortcut app, thus you can integrate your health data into any automated workflow.\n\nI think your privacy is very important, thus I do not collect any of your health data and I do not share your health data with any analytics provider.\n\n-----------------------------\nAggregated data types:\n-----------------------------\nActivity:\n- Apple Watch stand hours\n- Distance cycling\n- Distance downhill snow sports\n- Distance swimming\n- Distance walking / running\n- Exercise time\n- Flights Climbed\n- Stand time\n- Step count\n- Swimming stroke count\n\nEnergy:\n- Active energy burned\n- Basal energy burned\n\nHeart rate:\n- Heart rate\n- Resting heart rate\n- Walking heart rate\n\nNutrition:\n- Caffeine\n- Calcium\n- Carbohydrates\n- Cholesterol\n- Energy consumed\n- Fat saturated\n- Fat total\n- Fiber\n- Iron\n- Potassium\n- Protein\n- Sodium\n- Sugar\n- Vitamin A\n- Vitamin C\n- Vitamin D\n- Water\n\nWheelchair:\n- Distance wheelchair\n- Wheelchair push count\n\n-----------------------------\nRecord based data types:\n-----------------------------\nAudio exposure:\n- Environmental sound levels\n- Headphone sound levels\n\nBlood:\n- Blood glucose\n- Blood pressure (Diastolic)\n- Blood pressure (Systolic)\n- Insulin delivery\n\nBody:\n- 6 minute walk test\n- Alcoholic beverages\n- Body fat percentage\n- Body mass\n- Body mass index\n- Body temperature\n- Handwashing\n- Height\n- Lean body mass\n- Mindfulness\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Respiratory rate\n- Sleep: Time asleep\n- Sleep: Time in bed\n- Tooth brushing\n- VO2 Max\n- Waist circumference\n- Walking steadiness\n- Walking steadiness notification\n\nHeart rate:\n- Event: High heart rate\n- Event: Irregular heart rhythm\n- Event: Low heart rate\n- Heart rate\n- Heart rate variability (SDNN)\n- Resting heart rate\n- Walking heart rate\n\nReproductive health:\n- Basal body temperature\n- Cervical mucus quality\n- Intermenstrual bleeding\n- Menstrual flow\n- Ovulation test result\n- Pregnancy test\n- Progesterone test\n- Sexual activity\n\n-----------------------------\n\nAccessibility should be an important part of every application.

This assessment is to ensure you have a suitable fitness level to become a police officer. It involves taking part in a bleep test and dynamic strength test.\n\nJOB RELATED FITNESS TEST:\nAs from September 2013, every police officer in the country  required to undertake personal safety training will also be required to pass an annual fitness assessment. Don't be caught off guard. Make sure you're already at the required standard!\n\nThis app is aimed to assist training for the UK police fitness test but may also be relevant for other UK and foreign public service fitness assessments.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\"Bleeping good. Very easy to use. Good for building up my fitness\" \n5 stars - UK\n\n\"Nice app to have whilst training for my specials assessment in a couple of weeks\"\n5 stars - UK\n\n---------------------------------\n\nBLEEP TEST:\nBeep tests are split into a number of different levels, with a number of beeps at each level. The minimum requirement for police officers in England and Wales is level 5.4 (i.e. level 5, 4 beeps). The total running time for this is about 3 minutes and 40 seconds. In Scotland the level is set at between 9.2 and 6.10, dependent on you age.\n\nThe 15m bleep test featured in this app is identical to the audio track published by the Collage of Policing and is the audio track you will hear on the day of your fitness assessment.\n\n\nPUSH/PULL STRENGTH TEST:\nThe push/pull dynamic strength test is used to measure your strength. This test involves performing five seated chest pushes and five seated chest pulls on a machine called a 'dyno'. To pass this test you need to pull on average at least 35kg and push on average at least 34kg."

At the specified alarm time, the bells will begin to ring in a pre-defined pattern - starting out softly and slowly and gradually getting louder and more frequent.  You'll come out of your slumber slowly and peacefully.  No more being jolted awake.\n\n+ After setting the alarm, the app can be put in the background - allowing you to use other apps.  At the specified alarm time, the alarm pattern will begin.\n\n+ Choose from five pre-defined patterns with varying bell schedules and escalation lengths.\n\n+ Choose from six different bells of varying size and metal compositions - from bright and clean to deep and complex with lovely overtones.\n\n+ You may enter journal notes upon awakening - great for recording your dreams before the memory fades.  You can then go back and review your journal entries and you may export the journal via email.  For privacy, you may set a password to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n+ To save battery, you may lock your device's screen and the alarm will still work.  Either start the alarm and press the lock (sleep) button, or turn on the \"Auto-Lock\" setting.\n\n+ This app uses the same amazing bell sounds used in our Insight Timer meditation timer.  Here are some app store comments pertaining to the bells:\n\n  \"Best sounding bells of any meditation app so far\" - sibergrrl\n\n  \"The bell samples in this app are gorgeous\" - LairBob\n\n  \"Several different bell sounds to choose from and they all feel 'live'\" - VaderPi\n\n  \"Great Sound Quality\" - KarlAgathon\n\n  \"The tones are stunning\" - hellsleeve\n\n  \"Beautiful bell sounds\" - Wolf94114\n\n  \"Wonderful digital bell sounds\" - zenji\n\n  \"The bell sounds are lovely\" - pngwen\n\nOther Features:\n\n- Snooze from 1 minute to 30 minutes\n\n- Sure Wake: Optional LOUD backup sound\n\n- Seven colors available for time display\n\n- Optionally keep phone from sleeping\n\n- Huge landscape time display\n\n- App works even when phone is sleeping (locked)"

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

The app also makes it easy to keep track of where you are in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThis Russian squat cycle has also been used by many for other lifts such as the bench press, shoulder press and deadlift with big jumps in strength. Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

      "label": "Anxiety Release shows you how to release anxious thoughts and feelings naturally, by harnessing the power of your brain. It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process. \n\nBecause bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings.  All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;\n1 x brain training session\n2 x guided anxiety management sessions\n1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)\n1 x safe place exercise\nProgress Log function\nPowerful Bls brain visual \nThis App is suitable for both clinicians and clients\n\nCaution: Persons suffering with complex PTSD or mental health problems, multiple psychological trauma or unstable neurological conditions (eg; epilepsy) should not use this product without medical supervision."

      "label": "DBT Diary Card is the only DBT iPhone app designed and created by a licensed and DBT intensively trained psychologist.\n\nHighlights of version 3.0:\n\n+ graphing data across time\n+ on device PDF viewing\n+ daily reminders\n+ Password locking to prevent others from seeing your diary cards.\n\nRead what our actual users say:\n\n\"***** Best DBT app available!!!\nSimply put, this is the most helpful DBT or CBT app available. I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary. Thank you for this app!\" - iTunes US Review\n\n\"***** I am in IRL-DBT and this app is the perfect complement. Oh. I love that the app is so flexible, that you can make it kind of your own, and the layout is so nice, simple, yet beautiful. For me, a true life-saver! Genius! Without a doubt the best app in my IPhone... Get it now!\" - iTunes Sweden Review\n\n\"***** Perfect! Worth the money!\" - iTunes US Review\n\nAs an educated consumer, it's important to know to whom you're listening. DBT Diary Card was created by a Ph.D. psychologist trained directly by Dr. Marsha Linehan and at the Duke University Medical Center; we are experts in DBT, providing consultation to many in our community. And now we're giving it to you!\n\nA DBT app can have 3 parts: \n\n- A reference manual\n- A behavior tracker\n- A skills coach\n\nDBT Diary Card has all 3 of these parts and utilizes the iOS platform in ways that the other apps available don't and can't.\n\n+ PDF generation\n+ Notification Pane support\n+ Password protection\n+ Advanced text editing\n+ Media playback\n\nWhat DBT Diary Card has to offer:\n\n- Skills. LOTS of them. Every DBT skill you've ever heard about in a group is in here. It can be your quick reference to your skills so that you don't have to carry around your book or binder. Every skill is described in readable language to help you understand them easily and it's all just a quick tap away.\n\n- Emotions. All the \"basic\" emotions are presented, again with descriptions and explanations a quick tap away.\n\n- Behaviors. The most troublesome are pre-loaded.\n\n- Coaching. If you know you need to use a skill but can't think of which one or can't remember how to choose, use the app. The coaching can be your virtual therapist. \n\n- Complete customizability. Are you working on something different or do you have a different understanding of a particular skill or emotion? Change it. It's that easy. You are not wedded to the way it's presented in the app. It's all completely customizable.\n\n- 911 skills.  Put your emergency skills a tap away. You can call directly from the app, listen to your distress tolerance music, remember what apps help in the moment. \n\n- Email. You can email your therapist your diary card on a weekly basis automatically, you can do it manually whenever you'd like or you can have the app remind you.\n\n* Telephony features require an iPhone and voice service."

Or when paused, rotate the jog wheel to forward and rewind frame by frame\n\nThis extensive app also includes three full articles on using the animations to improve your technique and a full comparison of the two stroke styles on view - 'The Swinger' and 'The Smooth'. Find out why each one is a great stroke technique and how to make it work best for you.\n\nAbout Swim Smooth:\n\nSwim Smooth is an innovative coaching company focusing on improving your individual stroke technique based on your height, build, gender and swimming experience.\n\nWe have coaching bases in Australia and the UK, and in 2011 we were selected by British Triathlon to write their swimming coaching curriculum.

Use any of the available, most popular 1 Rep Max formulas to estimate your 1 rep maximum weight and keep a log to see your progress over time.\n\nSimply select a lift type, enter a weight and a number of repetitions (up to 10), and tap the Calculate button to see your 1 Rep Max.\n\nWith My 1 Rep Max Premium, you can create your own custom lifts and use more than 10 repetitions to perform calculations.\n\nA Note About Safety:\nOne rep maximum calculators are used to estimate the maximum amount you can lift. The degree of accuracy can vary significantly depending on your experience with weight training as well as your muscular composition. Most one rep maximum calculators are designed for experienced strength trainers so, if you are inexperienced, you may find your actual one rep maximum is much lower because your body is not accustomed to the stress of lifting heavy weight. Because it can be dangerous to attempt to lift your estimated maximum, always have a spotter with you. Seriously.\n\nMy 1 Rep Max will never bother you to request a rating or review. However,  if you'd like to take the time to rate or review it, you can do so from the Settings screen and that would be swell."

At the end of the Clean 9 programme it will work out your total inches lost and total weight lost and record the information so you can review it at a later time or when you are thinking about doing another cleanse.\n\nAnother handy function of the app is that you can view all the approved \"Free Foods\" in the app, again, without having to refer to your programme instruction booklet - handy when you are on the move or shopping."

It is commonly used by coaches and trainers to measure athlete fitness, or used as a pre-requisite for police, emergency and military organizations. \n\nThe standard test has 21 levels, and each level consists of a different number of shuttles. The test is performed by running between two markers placed 20 meters (65.6 feet) apart, at an increasing pace as indicated by the beeps. The test ends when you can no longer keep pace, or level 21 is completed.\n\nDetailed information about each test variation can be found in the app's online help."

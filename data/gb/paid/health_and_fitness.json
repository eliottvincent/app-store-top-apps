Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "If you love working out with Apple Watch, but you need more advanced fitness stats, HealthFit is for you.\n\nBy analyzing the workout data stored in Apple Health, HealthFit provides the kind of indispensable tracking and insights you normally only get from premium subscription services. But if you still prefer to use apps like Strava or Training Peaks, HealthFit has you covered with reliable automated background syncing.\n\nONE FITNESS APP THAT DOES IT ALL\n\nHealthFit combines a comprehensive activity feed with insightful fitness statistics and all your essential health metrics in one beautifully designed app. So you don’t need to go hunting around in multiple apps to track your fitness progress.\n\nSYNC YOUR WORKOUTS SEAMLESSLY\n\nSyncing with platforms like Strava can be a fiddly, laborious process and the results aren’t always great. HealthFit solves this by syncing automatically in the background after every workout. So you don’t have to lift a finger, it just works. It can even sync your entire workout history.\n\nWith support for more than 25 platforms (see below), HealthFit is fitness hub, keeping all your workout data in sync.\n\nWORKOUTS: THE ACTIVITY FEED YOU REALLY NEED\n\nBrowse your workouts in the Activity Feed, with route maps, photos and essential stats all visible at a glance. Tap on a workout for a treasure trove of essential insights, like customizable Heart Rate Zones, Training Load and Recovery Times. You can even log which bike or shoes you use, to monitor usage and flag when it’s time to replace them.\n\nHealthFit finds photos you take during your workouts automatically, bringing your activity feed to life with stunning images you can share on social media.\n\nRUNNING POWER ANALYSIS\n\nHealthFit provides advanced running power analysis with the automatically estimated critical power, the weighted average power, the power distribution chart by 25W Increments and the mean maximal power chart which shows your best average power for time periods of one second up to the length of your run.\n\nMULTISPORT AND INTERVAL WORKOUTS\n\nHealthFit is the only app to export multisport workouts as multisession activities\n\nSTATISTICS: UNCOVER HIDDEN FITNESS INSIGHTS\n\nApple Watch gathers so much fitness data, it can sometimes seem overwhelming. HealthFit mines that data to provide essential charts and summaries that show you exactly how you’re doing, with indispensable insights that will help you to raise your fitness game.\n\nStats are broken down by activity type, with handy Year Comparison charts. You can monitor changes in your Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ALT), and Form (TSB), Heat Maps reveal where you’ve been training, and your Explorer Score reveals how much you’ve been getting around.\n\nHEALTH METRICS: THE STATS THAT MATTER\n\nHealthFit provides a curated view of your health metrics focusing on the essential stats every athlete needs to know, whether you’re a serious competitor, a weekend warrior, or just beginning your fitness journey.\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR FAVORITE FITNESS ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike most fitness apps, HealthFit doesn't just focus on running and cycling. We treat all activity types equally, presenting your most frequent activity types more prominently, with specially tailored stats and charts.\n\nUNBEATABLE ON PRIVACY\n\nAll your data stays on your iPhone where it belongs. Our app runs on your phone, not in the cloud. We don’t use any trackers to monitor your activity and we never will.\n\nSUPPORTED SYNCING PLATFORMS\n\nStrava, TrainingPeaks, Final Surge, Selfloop, Smashrun, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyBike, Ride with GPS, Cycling Analytics, Today's Plan, Runalyze, Suunto, 2PEAK, Xhale, Komoot, Map My Tracks, Stages Link, TrainAsONE, Tredict, Intervals.icu, Nolio.

      "label": "Camera Heart Rate Variability is the first app that lets you record, plot and export time and frequency domain Heart Rate Variability Features - without requiring any heart rate monitor.\n\nCamera HRV uses a technique called photoplethysmography (PPG for short), which consists in detecting changes in blood volume during a cardiac cycle, by illuminating the skin and measuring changes in light absorption. PPG has become quite a popular non-invasive method for extracting physiological measurements such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. However, most applications today focus simply on heart rate or respiration rate.\n\nSupported devices for the camera measurement: iPhones 5, 5S, 6, 6S, 6+, 6S+, SE, 7, 7+, 8, 8+, X, XS, XS Max, XR, 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, 12 mini, 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max, 13 mini, 13, 13 Pro, 13 Pro Max\n\nCamera HRV can assess cardiac autonomic regulation through quantification of sinus rhythm variability. Since HRV aims at quantifying autonomic regulations, it can be used as marker of sympathetic or parasympathetic predominance, and therefore become relevant in many applications. In athletes for example heavy training is responsible for shifting the cardiac autonomic balance toward a predominance of the sympathetic over the parasympathetic drive, and HRV analysis attempts to quantify this shift. \n\nOther applications span from stress monitoring, assessment of pathological conditions and even emotional regulation during financial decision-making.\n\nMain Features:\n- extracts, plots, stores and exports heart rate, rr-intervals, time and frequency domain heart rate variability features (AVNN, SDNN, rMSSD, pNN50, LF, HF, LF/HF)\n- configurable time window for feature extraction (30 seconds to 5 minutes)\n- automatic RR-interval correction\n- event annotation\n- comparison between up to 3 recordings lets you get a better understanding of  autonomic regulation and sympathetic/parasympathetic activity under different contexts in a glance\n- data export/storage on iTunes and Dropbox (csv format, exports heart rates, rr intervals, events and computed features). Data export needs to be performed from the history -> recording view, by clicking on the export button (bottom left).\n- integration with the Health app (writes Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability)\n\nFind out more at this link: http://www.marcoaltini.com/2/post/2014/01/heart-rate-variability-using-the-phones-camera.html"

I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you.

Imagine a dark room where someone is turning a flash-light on and off. The light is very obvious and distracting. Now imagine that the room lights are turned on. The flash-light is still being turned on and off, but is no longer noticeable because it has been \"masked\". Sound masking is a similar process of covering a distracting sound with a more soothing or less intrusive sound.\n\nThe masking must reduce the difference between the steady background level and the transient levels associated with both speech and other sounds. Motivation and productivity are improved when this is accomplished. The masking sound itself must not change rapidly and should be as meaningless as possible.\n\nSound masking reduces or eliminates awareness of pre-existing sounds in a given area and can make a work environment more comfortable, while creating speech privacy so workers can better concentrate and be more productive. Sound masking can also be used in the outdoors to restore a more natural ambient environment.\n\nWhite noise is a common synthetic noise source used for sound masking by a tinnitus masker."

This assessment is to ensure you have a suitable fitness level to become a police officer. It involves taking part in a bleep test and dynamic strength test.\n\nJOB RELATED FITNESS TEST:\nAs from September 2013, every police officer in the country  required to undertake personal safety training will also be required to pass an annual fitness assessment. Don't be caught off guard. Make sure you're already at the required standard!\n\nThis app is aimed to assist training for the UK police fitness test but may also be relevant for other UK and foreign public service fitness assessments.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\"Bleeping good. Very easy to use. Good for building up my fitness\" \n5 stars - UK\n\n\"Nice app to have whilst training for my specials assessment in a couple of weeks\"\n5 stars - UK\n\n---------------------------------\n\nBLEEP TEST:\nBeep tests are split into a number of different levels, with a number of beeps at each level. The minimum requirement for police officers in England and Wales is level 5.4 (i.e. level 5, 4 beeps). The total running time for this is about 3 minutes and 40 seconds. In Scotland the level is set at between 9.2 and 6.10, dependent on you age.\n\nThe 15m bleep test featured in this app is identical to the audio track published by the Collage of Policing and is the audio track you will hear on the day of your fitness assessment.\n\n\nPUSH/PULL STRENGTH TEST:\nThe push/pull dynamic strength test is used to measure your strength. This test involves performing five seated chest pushes and five seated chest pulls on a machine called a 'dyno'. To pass this test you need to pull on average at least 35kg and push on average at least 34kg."

For example, the requirement for police officer candidates in England and Wales is to reach level 5.4 (i.e. level 5, four beeps). The total running time for this is about 3 minutes and 40 seconds. \n\nBleep test is a commonly used term for shuttle run, multistage fitness test and beep test."

      "label": "WHAT IS CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nClock Yourself challenges you to think on your feet.  \n\nIt involves exercise for your body and your brain, at the same time.  \nEvery challenge will stimulate your brain in a different way. \n\nYou don't have to master one challenge before you can explore another challenge.  \n\nSome call this an exercise app. \nSome call this a brain games app.  \nWhy can’t it be both?! \n\n\n \nWHO CAN USE CLOCK YOURSELF? \n\nEveryone! \n\nClock Yourself exercises involve taking one step in all directions on a circle visualised beneath your feet. It’s perfect for exercise at home.  \n\nAthletes often modify Clock Yourself exercises outdoors for sport-specific agility drills, by visualising a much larger circle and running between the coordinates.  \n\nSimilarly, people who are unable to walk can modify Clock Yourself to practise reaching with their arms, or wheelchair agility! \n\nIf you think you’re too slow to use Clock Yourself, you’re probably wrong.  \nIf you think you’re too fit to use Clock Yourself, you’re definitely wrong! \n\n\n\n\nWHY DID WE MAKE CLOCK YOURSELF?\n\nThe Clock Yourself concept originated in neurological rehabilitation. Now anyone can use it to harness their neuroplasticity.  \n\nIt was developed by Australian physiotherapist @MegLowryPT and software developer Dave Wallace. \n\n\n \nWe had 5 goals: \n\n1. Make it fun - Clock Yourself exercises are so entertaining that you’ll show your friends at parties! \n\n2. Make it versatile  - Both the stepping speed and the cognitive complexity are in your control.  \n\n3. Make it evidence based - This is a volitional step training method. Volitional stepping trains faster steps in all directions to improve your chances of catching yourself during a fall.  \n\n4. Make it portable - There is no need to set up mats, wires or sensors. It also works offline. It only requires internet for your initial download from the App Store.  \n\n5. Make it affordable - This is a once off purchase for pocket change. It has no recurring subscriptions and no advertisements.  \n\n\n\nIS CLOCK YOURSELF AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES? \n\nYes and no. \n\nAt this stage, all of the buttons and instructions are in English only.  \n\nHowever, if you click the Options button within each challenge (except for the Simple Colours challenge) you can choose to play the audio prompts in six other languages. \n\nMandarin \nJapanese \nFrench  \nGerman \nSpanish \nDutch  \n\nWhat are you waiting for?  Go ahead and Clock Yourself!\n\n“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new” - Albert Einstein"

      "label": "“Worked great for his bedtime—the look on his face was so calmed.” Christi (mother of 3 week old)\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher is a soothing sounds machine to calm & stop baby crying cycle\r\n\r\nThe Baby Shusher App is a revolutionary new tool for parents that will calm baby easily using soothing sounds. This sleepmatic sounds machine is created using an ancient but doctor-tested and approved technique to help soothe your fussy baby calm with a shusher sound in cradle. \r\n\r\nA simple baby shusher with soothing sounds for baby that works on a single click, making calming sounds like baby lullaby that would work instantly and can be played for hours, recommended by parents, baby photographers, and doctors dealing with babies.\r\n\r\nBy creating calm sounds, safely stop the baby from crying with a rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. The shush baby app helps to soothe baby calm and increase the baby sleep timer.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Sound Equalizer allows the app to \"listen\" to your baby crying or not every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby cry volume till baby calms down (so when the baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush sound to relax baby).\r\n\r\nA newborn sleep magic baby sound machine that works best for a newborn baby to calm down quickly and manage baby sleeping patterns. A sleep aid that creates calming sounds for babies in the form of a shhh sound sleeper that will stop your baby crying, calms down easily, and put baby to sleep. \r\n\r\nThis shhh app calm baby instantly by creating a shusher sound, helping the baby relax in minutes using calming sounds for kids.

This app calculates the weights you should use, based on your one rep max, for the 3-week Smolov Jr. and 13-week Full Smolov Squat protocols. The app also makes it easy to keep track of where you are in the cycle.\r\n\r\nThis Russian squat cycle has also been used by many for other lifts such as the bench press, shoulder press and deadlift with big jumps in strength. Smolov isn't for new lifters, but if you have some experience under your belt (like with 5/3/1, starting strength, 20 squat, etc.), then this may be a great lifting protocol for you."

Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.\n\nA randomised controlled trial has shown that MoodMission can improve mental health and wellbeing (Bakker et al., 2019), and two other studies published in scientific journals have provided further support (Bakker & Rickard, 2019; Bakker et al., 2018). Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific evidence, and very few available mental health apps have RCT support (Firth et al., 2018).\n\nCompleting Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a Mission log helps you track your progress over time.\n\nMoodMission learns which types of Missions work best for you, so the more you use MoodMission the better it gets at tailoring your Mission suggestions.\n\nMoodMission is not a replacement for professional help. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, or any mental health issue, talk to your GP or contact a psychologist for support."

      "label": "Reprogramming your Self is an App for daily use in order to step out of the circle of constantly repeating your past and consciously creating a new state of being – thus creating a new future, of course! We keep creating the future constantly and in every single second with our thoughts and feelings as well as with our beliefs and perceptions.\n\nWith the morning meditation you will get yourself into a coherent state of alpha or theta brainwaves. In those states you will be far more susceptible for suggestions. Your brain will be recalibrated automatically when you do this meditation of open space and you can gear your new Self-consciously towards the new day.\nDuring your evening meditation you will get into the present moment and linger in the emptiness of quantum space. As the observer you allow the day to pass by as you become an awareness of possibilties. In that state you will create the next day, your future.\n\nUse the meditation for changing your perceptions and beliefs to move into a new state of being. You will do this by marrying a clear intention with a higher emotion. This App will provide you with a range of options in order to get focussed on a specific goal.\nWe are able to influence any condition as well as our outside reality using our mind alone simply by changing our old beliefs and patterns and our perceptions of ourselves and our environment.\n\nThis App contains:\n- Morning meditation\n- Evening meditation\n- Meditation for changing your convictions and beliefs about yourself\n- Capacity to write down your goals\n- Mapping your results daily\n- Evaluation and statistics\n- Background information for changing your beliefs and perceptions\n\nNote: The Meditations are the same as on the CD or MP3-Download \"You are the Placebo #2\".We have split the Meditations in the App for a easier daily use into Morning, Evening and Changing Beliefs-Meditation."

      "label": "Harness your innate survival responses to reverse anxiety and tension and feel more confident, naturally. Based on the popular CD of the same name, Calm and Confident is for anyone who is struggling with too much stress and not enough confidence. As the name suggests, this app is designed to help you feel both calm and confident. The app comprises innovative 10 guided meditations based on trauma therapy principles. Two of the central sessions are the 19 and 27 minute respectively Calm and Confident sessions. These transformative sessions incorporate focused attention, sensory stimulation, relaxation and re-connection with personal resources to change how you feel about yourself. Another session (‘Healing Anxiety’) addresses the role that childhood emotional neglect plays in maintaining anxiety.  Other sessions are designed to stimulate increased self-awareness, emotional regulation and security through various combinations of auditory, visual and mental stimuli.\n\nFeeling calm is essential for health and wellbeing, but without confidence it's just a nice feeling. Confidence is the end-product of feeling calm; it means experiencing yourself as connected, self-aware, energized, whole, and capable. Confidence is feeling okay about your feelings, needs and wants - it’s about feeling able to become the best version of yourself – not necessarily perfect, but the best ‘you’. As Lao Tzu said, ‘Health is the greatest possession. Contentment is the greatest treasure. Confidence is the greatest friend.’ Calm and Confident will help you to find your inner friend.\n\nBased on recent discoveries regarding brain structure and functioning, Calm and Confident uses applied neuroscience to teach you how to communicate more effectively with your nervous system to effect change. The deepest learning comes from experience, activities which stimulate sensory-emotional learning. This is different to  the ‘2+2 = 4’ kind of learning you got in school – it’s the learning that comes from doing something which changes how you feel about yourself – leading to new connections, new neural pathways. This kind of learning takes you from ‘I’m worthless’ to ‘I’m okay’; from ‘I can’t’ to ‘I can.’\n\nThe secret to achieving such confidence (when stress is getting in the way) is focused attention + bilateral stimulation (BLS), a unique combination which stimulates an in-built activation-deactivation circuit in your nervous system. BLS enables you to ‘hijack’ your own fight-flight response and transform anxiety and tension into relaxation and calm, naturally and effortlessly. It does this by harnessing your brain’s innate information processing capabilities. When your brain detects a stimuli such as BLS it‘s threat systems get activated while it figures out what’s going on. After a few seconds, once your brain recognizes there is no threat (no sabre-toothed tiger), it returns to normal levels of arousal, bringing your body with it. This happens naturally and quickly, without your having to try.\n\nThe resulting feelings of relaxation not only reduce stress – they also facilitate increased confidence. When your nervous system is in a relaxed state it is more receptive to the true real-life affirmations embedded in the tracks on this app, resulting a more positive self-state. The amazing part is that this all happens as naturally as you might experience the pleasure that comes from watching a sunset or walking on a beach. This effect has been confirmed by research. \n\nBilateral stimulation is a treatment element of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) EMDR, the revolutionary treatment for PTSD. The method seems to resolve trauma-related memories and feelings more rapidly and effectively than traditional methods.\n\nThe app can be used for emotional ‘first-aid’, as an adjunct to psychotherapy and as part of long-term efforts to feel more confident. You can learn to feel different - you know much more than you think."

Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

      "label": "CBT in your pocket. Helping you become your own therapist. \n\nPurchase just once and receive both the iPhone AND iPad versions\n\nCBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) is a proven effective treatment for Depression and Anxiety. It is used by the NHS, American Psychiatric Association, Australian Department for Health and many others to treat depression and anxiety disorders such as: OCD, generalised anxiety, health anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia and specific phobias (like arachnophobia, fear of heights, etc.). \n\nIt is cheaper and more effective than medication alone for conditions such as low mood and now for less than the cost of a music album or a computer game.  This app is a user-friendly companion to CBT, this can be used to make talking therapy more helpful and to support those undertaking self-help.  \n\nPocket CBT was designed by a  fully accredited Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapist so you can be assured that this application complements any therapy you might receive or appropriate self-help CBT you choose to undertake. \n\nThe application is divided into two segments that are central to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Record and Challenge\n\nThought Record:\nFirst you record The Situation, Thoughts, Sensations, Emotions, Behaviour involved.  This is known as functional analysis; this is key to understanding what vicious cycles are maintaining the problem you are experiencing (this is sometimes called  the cross-sectional formulation). Writing this down has historically been quite complex to get to grips with. Now with Pocket CBT it is simple for you to proceed through a series of questions to allow you to gain an objective view of the situation and understand what is driving your thinking. Better still, you can view this in a diagram and even email it.\n\nThought Challenge:\nThe second section allows you to challenge your thinking. Drawing from the most commonly identified thinking styles (schemas) of CBT. You are guided through a series of questions to allow you the opportunity to re-appraise the ‘hot thought’ (the key negative automatic thought). This is done by writing your responses to key questions that guide you to your conclusion. You can continue to challenge the key thought and re-rate your beliefs and consequent emotional state. Since this application works like a diary, you can look back at the summaries of your challenges to these typical thoughts that affect your mood.  Moving from reactive to proactive. \n\nFeatures:\n- Record and Challenge your negative thoughts\n- View a diary of Thought records & Challenges\n- Email your Thought Record as a PDF\n- All challenge types fully explained\n- Easy to navigate menus\n- Clear and simple questions to understand complex situations\n- Qualified Clinician designed and tested"

      "label": "By analyzing HRV and Stress along with additional data, SweetBeat HRV provides a deeper dive into health and provides insight into what activities you engage in that effect the health metrics you care about.\n\nIMPORTANT: SweetBeat requires external hardware:\nA tested Bluetooth Low Energy Heart Rate Monitor, Wellue DuoEK hand held heart rate monitor or a Wellue VisualBeat heart rate monitor patch.  While other manufacturers wrist worn devices work well for heart rate, their wrist worn heart rate monitors are not accurate enough for HRV and so are not supported. The iWatch is not supported.  The wrist worn devices can be used for Food Sensitivity tests.\n\n•Please visit https://www.sweetwaterhrv.com/healthsensors.shtml for a list of compatible Heart Rate Monitors devices.\n\nThe next big trend in bio-hacking is understanding the relationships between different metrics. SweetBeat HRV integrates and correlates data from popular fitness platforms like MapMyFitness, Fitbit and Withings.  SweetBeat HRV will also import your Apple Health app data (SDNN, Resting Heart Rate, Average Heart Rate) that is collected by the iWatch or other devices authorized to store metric in the Health app.  This data is for viewing purposes only and is not used in any HRV calculation or correlation.\n\nSweetBeat has four main components:\n•Monitor Stress\n•HRV for Training\n•Food Sensitivity\n•Data Correlation\n\nMonitor Stress: \nWith SweetBeatHRV, you can see your stress levels in real time, giving you the ability to take action to reduce stress. If your chosen stress threshold is reached, SweetBeat’s Relax screen prompts you with a deep breathing screen that includes calming images.\n\n•Stats: The stats screen more widely referred to as the “geek” screen, shows all the metrics being measured. If using the HealthPatch, the user can view the additional provided metrics.\n•Graph: The graph screen shows a real-time building graph of your heart rate from RR Intervals. Turning the phone 90 degrees counter-clockwise will bring up the graph in landscape. \n•Export RR Intervals: SweetBeat provides RR interval export capability. \n\nHRV For Training: \nIn competitive sports, improved performance is often affected by alternating periods of intensive training with periods of relative rest. SweetBeatHRV measures HRV, an objective measure of your body’s response to each workout and provides training recommendations based on the morning reading. \n\nFood Sensitivity Test: \nIf you are sensitive to certain foods, you may not experience symptoms, though your body reacts by elevating your heart rate after eating an offending food. Low level food sensitivities may contribute to inflammation. This inflammation tells the body to hang onto stored fat to combat whatever stress caused the hormonal release. SweetBeatHRV measures your pulse three times after eating and assigns either a “X” (sensitive) or a green checkmark (not sensitive).  \n\nCorrelation: \nThe correlation screen uses a patent pending algorithm to correlate all of the data the user has shared with SweetBeat. This data will come from the app itself and any other apps or devices the user has authorized (Fitbit, Withings, and/or MapMyFitness). \n\nThe correlation feature turns your data into useful information and provides insight into what combination of activities lead to desired HRV, stress or weight, giving you the knowledge you need to achieve your health and fitness goals.\n\nSweetBeat Features: \n•Post your session summary on Twitter to share with friends.\n•Customize your Relax screen images with your favorite pictures. \n•Track your heart rate recovery after exercising. \n•Track the foods you have eaten and your body’s response to them. \n•Save and upload sessions to your secure MySweetBeat account at www.BeatHealthy.com. \n•Email your RRs and session data for personal analysis off-line\n•View your Apple Health data with trend lines"

I love this app so glad I found it \nnauf4l: was planning to buy a 100$ jump rope which counts skips as i always do 5k skips a day. So after a month was considering this when i came across this app after installing 5 apps of the same.Glad i paid about 2$ for this as it is totally worth it. \nFrankWurst: Accurate jump counter based solely on Apple Watch. App integrates into My Health and Activity App seamlessly. Great product.\ntafty：I enjoy the skipping experience with this app. And it syncs well with Apple Watch\n\nContact me\nE-mail:89208242@qq.com\nTwitter: @haozes\nTelegram Group: t.me/yaoyaonow  \n\nDesign by Haozes\nThanks for the translation: 橙子、金小粉、孟金羽、蔡沛森、Adgar, Fabio Carrilho, Tomás Feliú Ribeiro, Francesco Tirsi, Leonard Pitt Diehl, Zhimin Yang, Massimiliano Benini,Radu Ionescu,Andrés Leon,Dikran Jessaijan, Krishna"

IT’S ALOT - I KNOW :)\nAnd that is why I have created the POLE WITH STEPH MONTHLY PROGRAMS. Upon downloading the app, you will have the option to become a premium member to enjoy the benefits of this all - inclusive program for all levels. Every month, you will receive a thorough program, with specific challenges & homework added weekly.\nI make sure to give you instruction in all those things that are important for safe, consistent progress that you not only see but also FEEL!! With the programs, I teach you how to work WITH your body, so you can achieve all your pole & flexibility goals with a body that feels GOOD, balanced, and strong… not one that hurts after being forced into a move it wasn’t ready for.\nAs a member of the program, you will enjoy the following benefits:\n\n1:1 Feedback - you can ask questions and share videos with me, so I can make sure you are getting the most out of the program. There is also a group to share progress and struggles and connect with your fellow members.\n\nDownloadable personal training log to schedule and reflect on your training sessions.\n\n3 Day/ week gym training program\n\nThis program is designed for intermediate and advanced students looking to level up their training. There is a strong emphasis on shoulder health, overall core stability & strength, inversion practice, active leg flexibility, and upper body push/ pull circuits in order to balance and strengthen your body for your pole or aerial training. Each session is 45-75 minutes and is best performed at a gym, however, can be modified for home or pole studio training. These workouts are written by Tiana Nicole Tallant, who has her DPT and has extensive knowledge in anatomy, movement, motor learning & skill development, and programming. I've personally been following her programming since 2019 and it has immensely contributed to my progress!\nSo what are you waiting for?? It’s time to spend LESS time planning and MORE time training and practicing!!\nCONTACT\nInstagram: @stephanietallant_pole\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/StephanieTallant\nWebsite: https://linktr.ee/stephanietallant\nHASHTAG the following to be featured\n#Polewithsteph #Flexwithsteph #Pwsapp #thepoleapp\n\nT&Cs and Privacy Policy can be found at: https://polewithsteph.disciplemedia.com/onboarding_documents"

If you're someone that's training for rounds, doing circuit work, etc. this app is worth your 99 cents. With the level of customization you get, the app is competitive with the way more expensive round timer devices that can cost upwards of $10-100.\"\n- by Shawn Lord, www.mastersdivision.com\n\n\"I found a GREAT interval timer app in the iTunes store for 99 cents!!! It's called Round Timer and it works like a dream!!!\"\n- by Miss Lee, forums on thecathenation.com\n\n\"Its a really useful applications. Beats carrying around that big round timer from the old days.\"\n- by Michael Manna, T4Show.com\n\n-----------------------------------\n- Description -\n\nThe Round Timer was the first round/sparring/boxing timer available in the AppStore and, as a result, the most refined and stable. Don't be fooled by knock-offs (other developers copying our interface and layout). \n\nThe Round Timer is a convenient round/boxing/sparring timer for your iPhone/iPod touch, now compatible with iOS 8.  The Round Timer is a fully functional round/sparring timer that allows you to customize the length of the rounds, warning bell and resting period.  Each of these intervals can be configured separately up to an hour. It will run in the background even if you switch to another App. \n\nWith the sound themes, you can choose which alarm sounds to use: boxing/MMA, a relaxing Zen theme, and a few others. Don't like any of the dozens of preinstalled sounds? Don't worry! You can record your own sounds.\n\nFor large, loud environments you can plug your device into a stereo, or for small sessions put it in the corner of the mat.  The Round Timer is great for any sparring or interval training: boxing, MMA, grappling / bjj, martial arts, yoga, meditation, crossfit, exercise, workout, stretching, etc.\n\nWorking out to music is not a problem. Start your music playing in the iPod app, then start RoundTimer. The sounds will play over top of your music without interrupting it.\n\nPlease feel free to e-mail support@plainandsimplesoftware.com to suggest new sound themes!\n\nInterested in interval training (Tabata, symmetrical, etc... intervals)? Check out our \"IntervalTimer\". Want more control? Check out \"UltraTimer\". Want full programmability and randomized intervals? Look at \"UltraTrainer\"."

Written Meditation Tips help support your experience with the guided meditations. No previous meditation experience is required.\n\n-- Breath Awareness Guided Meditation (5 min) - to get centered and relaxed when you only have time for a short break. \n-- Deep Rest Guided Meditation (13 min) - allows you to sink into a deeply restful state.

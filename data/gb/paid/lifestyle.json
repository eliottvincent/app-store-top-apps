      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

Designed to create a deeply relaxed state  of mind and empowered labour and birth. \n\nCreated by women for women, iHypnobirth, will help you feel positive about birthing your baby. \n\niHypnobirth contains tailored meditations for self-hypnosis and positive birth affirmations each created specifically for labour and birth.\n\niHypnobirth features the following hypnosis tracks; \n\n-Guided relaxation for self-hypnosis \nA guided hypnosis that prepares the mind for a relaxed state of mind and calm birth \n\n-Guided meditation with positive birth affirmations audio\nA longer relaxation with positive birth affirmations that will resonate deep within the sub-conscious\n\n-Positive birth affirmations \nThese are positive statements about pregnancy and birth which resonate within the sub-conscious allowing you to embrace a positive birth experience \n\niHypnobirth was created by Psychologist & hypnatal practitioner Dr Alex McKay and NLP trained Charlotte Maslen. With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

Every day for the rest of your life you will receive a positive message, beautifully presented.  Each message has an expanded summary of that day’s affirmation.  The message will be sent to your Apple device 3 times during the course of the day - morning, afternoon and evening.   This will provide you with the opportunity to both absorb and more importantly apply the daily message.  \n\nHappy Hints has been created for anyone looking to cultivate a happier frame of mind amidst the challenges of modern life.  Sadly, we are all moving too quickly and barely have the time to process what we are thinking and feeling.  This leaves most of us with a happiness deficit.  So whether you are a busy executive burdened by the demands of meetings and deadlines, a mother managing a home and looking after your children or you are just trying to find ways of managing the stress of life in the 21st century then Happy Hints is definitely for you!\n\nThe Happy Hints app also includes literally hundreds of audio-visual and written resources covering topics ranging from: how to manage anxiety, anger, depression and stress through to building self-confidence, developing a positive mental attitude and mindfulness tips.  \n\nThe beauty of this application is that it is simple to use and provides you with an encyclopedic resource at your fingertips.... which will serve up countless insights and invaluable inspirations when you most need them.  All the information is presented in an easily digestible format and you’ll soon find that Happy Hints will become an indispensable friend!  \n \nWe all have one thing in common.... our need to be happy.  Happiness is a virtue, but it’s really important to understand that it is also a skill.  A skill is something you can learn and develop and so happiness is something you can practise and the more you practise it the happier you will become.  \n \nWhy not let Happy Hints help you to do just that!"

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

Notifications will remind you when it is time to put out each type. Use the Apple Watch App or Widgets to quickly see your next collection.\n\nUse Siri shortcuts to ask when the next collection dates are for all bin schedules, which bin schedules are due on the next collection date, or when the next collection date is for an individual schedule. Manage shortcuts in Bin Day Alert's settings screen, the Shortcuts app, or in the Siri & Search section of Apple's Settings app.\n\nThe app supports a wide range of collection schedules, making it suitable for use at home or business premises: a specific day each week; multiple days each week; a specific day every 2, 3, 4 or 5 weeks; or a specific day on one or more weeks of the month.\n\nEach schedule can have up to two alerts. Each alert can either be for the day before or the day of the bin collection. Snooze an alert notification by 15 minutes if you're busy right now, or by 1 day/week if a public holiday has temporarily changed the bin schedule.\n\nGoing on vacation? There's a single setting to quickly disable all alerts.\n\nBack up your bin schedules to iCloud Drive, Dropbox etc. for safekeeping. Easily share your bin schedules with neighbors so they don't have to configure the app themselves."

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

It also provides a description for each phase, sign and mansion. You can navigate through the information in various ways — say, phase-by-phase, day-by-day or month-by-month - whatever is more convenient for you. \n\nPhases show you the energy of the day, signs — the mood of the day, while the void-of-course periods might tell you when it is better not to do certain things. Mansions were used by different cultures from the time immemorial, they tell for what a particular day is good or not so good.\n\nTo calculate the times, iLuna uses the time zone of the device on which it runs, so if your iPhone or iPod touch shows your current time correctly, iLuna's information is precise too.\n\nOnce any of the events reported by iLuna happens, you will get a notification, provided you allowed the app to send you notifications."

Use your TRÅDFRI connected restaurant as a party location.\n\nTRÅDFRI Disco does it all with your  IKEA® TRÅDFRI  setup. The Mood function changes your Hue Lights within a themed colorset at your chosen time interval over and over again. Perfect for warming up your party or any other occasion. \nJust perfect.\n\nThe stock IKEA® TRÅFRI app let’s you choose between just 20 colors. TRÅFRI Disco gives you the whole spectrum available on the system.\nBecause we connect direct, there is virtually no delay between the command and the light response like HomeKit.\n\nTRÅDFRI Disco is the best in recognizing your favorite music through the microphone. Even at low volume levels changes are accurately detected and transformed into a lightshow. It's the only TRÅDFRI App with a real fast Stroboscope! (Strobe)\n\nSome detailed features:\n\n\n****Audio options****\n- Microphone sensitivity sliders let you control how often music is turned into light (change)  and control silence detection. (dB)\n- Brightness control sliders manage the maximum and minimum brightness of your disco setup\n- Indicators to show when your thresholds are being 'hit' by the music. \n- LED indicator for TEMPO tap button indicating current BPM. \n-> Auto Disco (strobe, transition style)\n\n****Color Control and Custom Color Themes****\n- User configurable color themes.\n- Color control slider helps you set the saturation of bulbs.\n- Color range control\n- Transform any image from your library in a color theme.\n\n****Strobe****\n- New Color Strobe.\n- Rainbow Strobe.\n- Classic White Strobe\n- Custom Color Strobe \n- Strobe your own Custom Color theme\n\n-> Smooth, Snap or Mix Transition. For selecting soft or crazy wild fast transition. Warning for the epileptic! \n\n\n- Mood Tab. Control any mood with these new great features: \n-> Select transition/cycle time between selected lights from 1 second to 10 minutes! \n-> Choose a theme or select a color range \n-> Create your own color theme\n-> Choose to change all bulbs to the same color \n-> Or never change to the same color \n-> Or sometimes \n-> Or Frequent \n-> Shake for random setting within current theme (option) \n-> Overall Mood Brightness Control \n-> Overall Mood Color Intensity Control \n-> Sleeptimer for Mood mode \n\n\nTRÅDFRI Disco listens to an external sound source.

      "label": "The saints, having been human,  lived every type of earthly existence and it is in the details of their life stories that we find their patronages. By invoking the saints, we ask for guidance in overcoming our own earthly trials, much like one would ask advice of a family member or friend. Meditating  on the lives of these remarkable people inspires us to conquer our own personal obstacles. \n\nA novena is a nine day period of prayer. Usually the novena prayer is recited nine times in a row for nine consecutive days, the repetitive nature of the prayer serves to bring on a quiet and meditative state. When ones mind quiets down, it allows the solution to a problem to appear or even help in the acceptance of an unchangeable life challenge.  \n\nTo help you find a saint that can aid you with your specific dilemma, we have divided this app of thirty-six saints into four categories: Health, Occupations, Situations and States of Life. You can find your saint by personally relating to their history, by being drawn to the illustrated depictions in their holy cards, or by searching the Glossary of extensive problems and life situations.\n\nOur beautiful vintage holy cards depict the saints with the enigmatic attributes and symbols that are commonly used to represent them. Brief explanations of these symbols are given to help decipher the visual iconography in their images.  The prayers in this app are universally known and have been used for centuries as tools in obtaining clarity and peace of mind. All are free to utilize them, regardless of one's faith or religious belief."

      "label": "Most Beautiful iPhone version of Unfailing Novena To The Virgin Mary Undoer of Knots \n\nHow did this devotion start? \nTo show us the mission granted to the Virgin Mary by Her Son, an artist Johann Melchior Georg Schmittdner painted Mary Undoer of Knots with great grace. Since 1700, his painting has been venerated in the Church of St. Peter in Perlack, Augsburg, Germany. It was originally inspired by a meditation of Saint Irenaeus (Bishop of Lyon and martyred in 202) based on the parallel made by Saint Paul between Adam and Christ. Saint Irenaeus, in turn, made a comparison between Eve and Mary, saying:“Eve, by her disobedience, tied the knot of disgrace for the human race; whereas Mary, by her obedience, undid it”. \n\nBut what are these knots? \nThere are the problems and struggles we face for which we do not see any solution … knots of discord in your family, lack of understanding between parents and children, disrespect, violence, the knots of deep hurts between husband and wife, the absence of peace and joy at home. There are also the knots of anguish and despair of separated couples, the dissolution of the family, the knots of a drug addict son or daughter, sick or separated from home or God, knots of alcoholism, the practice of abortion, depression, unemployment, fear, solitude…The knots of our life suffocate our souls, and beat us down and betray the heart’s joy and separate us from God. \n\nMary, the Queen of Mercy, the one who knows all about us, who has compassion for us and hurries to rescue us, praying for each one of us to Her beloved Jesus.\n\nPray this Novena...you will be glad you found it!\n+JMJ"

      "label": "The Reconnect App was designed by Nishah Dennison - a Psychotherapist and Spiritual Practitioner with over two decades of experience. It was originally developed for her own use but she decided it would benefit others as a Mental Health Aid and tool for Spiritual Growth.\n \nReconnecting with yourself at regular intervals not only deepens your ability to meditate, but also fosters a ‘Self’ that has greater control over the ups and downs of life. Perfecting the ability to ‘switch off’ and ‘Stop’ is transferrable: this can be applied elsewhere in life when needed, such as switching off from stress. Cultivating the ability to switch off can help one gain control over a range of common mental disorders such as panic, anxiety, depression, phobias and self-harm - where one often feels ‘out of control’.\n \nGetting in touch with oneself and one’s body is also known to promote deeper relaxation, enhanced self-awareness and greater mindfulness. A Buddhist monk was once asked “what is the optimum time to meditate?”, his answer was “even a minute is beneficial”. Meditation doesn’t have to be for long and it can be done anywhere and at any time. It only takes a minute to switch off from external distractions and tune-in to oneself: unplugging from the outside world and plugging-in to your internal world. This can refresh and renew the ‘self’, to face the world grounded and clear.\n \nIf you want, you can focus on a particular area of your body or an energy centre (chakra) during each minute. For instance, focusing on your upper chest – your breathing and sensations, or focus on your heart chakra within the chest area. This is excellent for developing ‘Mindfulness of the Body’. Getting in touch with your body at regular intervals is highly beneficial, especially for those with body issues of all kinds. For instance with eating disorders and weight issues, there is often a disconnect from the body, so reconnecting with the body is an essential part of the healing process. Further guidelines and suggestions are provided.\n \nIf you are interested in Affirmations or Mantras, these can be selected to appear each minute. This is a great way to re-programme the unconscious mind, contemplate an issue, or use creative visualisation each minute. Simply select one that has meaning for you or select ‘Random’ mode to be inspired with something new and positive each hour. There is also the added bonus of creating your own custom Affirmation or custom Mantra to arise each hour, depending on what you are working on in your personal development.\n \nIf you want, you can check how much time you have accrued. There is a detailed breakdown, recorded for you to keep track of - Every Minute Counts!\nFinally, why not opt for a Day of Silence. Non-talking is hugely beneficial. Many retreats are ‘Silent Retreats’ for a good reason, but there is no need to attend a retreat in order to practice silence. Practising silence is a way of retaining your vital energy, as talking can burn and waste energy. Being silent cultivates deeper self-awareness and deeper self-reflection as one is naturally directed to ‘go within’ and experience one’s ‘inner world’ more. Talking is often distracting and takes us away from ourselves, and if not careful cultivates shallow communication. So ironically, ‘Non-Talking’ promotes better communication. If you aren’t speaking for the sake of it, you start to experience the value of words and expression more fully; this leads to more meaningful conversations and improves intimacy and one’s connection with others. For fun and practical purposes, you can choose a display sign to let people know that you are ‘In Silence’, or you can create your own Custom Sign to show people.\n.\nWhilst ReConnect has been designed to look simple and is easy to use, there are many options and uses that you can enjoy. Try it and observe the benefits."

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

EVP theory suggests that we can communicate with spirits or otherworldly entities on a recording device. The method that these spirits seem to be using is known as Sound Manipulation (Transform EVP). Though we are not exactly sure how this process is done we know that it involves the modulation of sound waves in a manner that will change it’s characteristics on to a recording device.They may also communicate in real time (Opportunistic EVP). Simply put, spirits can change sounds in order to form speech and therefor have the ability to communicate.\n\nFeatures:\n4 sound Banks\nOptional Microphone input\nAudio effects that are fully adjustable including Echo, Reverb, Noise Gate, and Pitch.\n4 Band Equalizer\nVisual ITC feature that uses the first ever Virtual Video Feedback method.\n\nThis paranormal app is made to work similar to that of a ghost box by providing \"raw audio\" that spirits can use to form speech. This device can be put on your phone so you can have it with you, you never know when you might end up at a haunted location. You have to work on building a connection with the other side. This will help improve your communication. \nDisclaimer:\nThere is no guarantee you will be able to communicate with spirits or ghosts. Results may vary. Use at your own risk."

      "label": "***Calmed puppies for 136 nights last month!***\n\nThis App was originally developed to help sooth newborns, and slowly ween them from the need to have a noise maker.  After a few months on the App Store, I started getting reviews that it was working great at calming a puppy.  Now rebranded and updated to focus on calming that new puppy, the Puppy Calmer is made to be simple.  \n\nPuppy Calmer is a super easy-to-use, soothing noise-maker app for the nervous puppy. With a sound that specially formulated for the small speakers of iPods/iPads/iPhones, this app is meant to comfort the pup with the reassuring, familiar sound of mommy’s heartbeat. Over 60 days, the sound will slowly fade out, allowing the puppy to slowly adjust to the stillness of the night and not have to depend on having background noise throughout their life. Every new addition can have a tough night, so the app allows you to add back as many days as you like if the sound needs to be a little louder on a tough night.\n\nOne simple screen shows the Play, Pause and Timer buttons. The app can be set to play for 10, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes, or for an unlimited amount of time. It remembers your choice from the last time you opened the app, so no need to reset each time. Just press play!\n\nReviews from Users who used Mommy's Heartbeat for their Pups!\n_________________\nAwesome for puppies!\nby karatekid23 - Version - 1.3 - Sep 27, 2013\n\nIf you are crate training a puppy... TRY THIS. Put this next to his crate and get a warm water bottle wrapped in a blanket or towel. 2 nights in with a 16 week old pup and its working like a charm!!\n__________________\nNew Puppy as well\nby New puppy as well - Version - 1.3 - Mar 3, 2013\n\nI so agree this app is great for puppies we just got a new puppy and this app gives me rest at night for you skeptical people if you read it says that it doesn't work for everyone so don't get mad at the app\n\n\n***Usage statics based on Apple provided, anonymous sessions for IOS 8+ who have opted in.

I love it!\" - nurse195829\n\n\"I am a totally blind knitter and use voiceover to read my iPhone screen. I have long wanted a row counter that was accessible to me. I found it! Works perfectly, and the sounds confirm that I have added or subtracted a row. The only thing that voiceover users want to know is that you need to double tap the pencil icon in order to make the project name text field active. This app is moving to the front page of my home screen! Thank you! Simplicity often means accessibility to me. Awesome!\" - ThaiFoodLady\n\n\"Its simplicity is great\" - hsbz. hsn \n\n\"i got it because i always forget to keep track of my stitches... it was so easy to use, i didn’t like the noise it made when you clicked it but i just turned it off. i also love how your able to choose what color you want!\" - milembh\n\n\"After trying several counter apps, this is by far by favorite.\" - H408\n\n\"I was looking for a counter app. Nothing fancy as I didn’t was one that took up a lot of memory on my device. Thus app is PERFECT. It’s super easy to use and a bit customizable too. If you are looking for a basic counter app, look no further. Thus app will meet your needs!\" - JB45840"

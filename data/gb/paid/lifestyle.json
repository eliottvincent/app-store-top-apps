When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor.

If you move the device after it has been calibrated you will need to recalibrate, simply click the \"Back\" button, move the device to a new area, then click \"Calibrate\" again.\n\nThere are 12 music box songs that his app randomly chooses from when it calibrates.\n\nThe sensors used are:\n\nMagnetometer - This senses Magnetic and Electromagnet fields around the device\nAccelerometer - This senses any device movement and the slightest vibrations around the device\nBarometer - Detects any change in the Ambient Air Pressure around the device\nCompass - Detects the slightest change in magnetic interference to Magnetic North\nGyroScope - Detects the slightest movement of the device\nOrientation - Detects the slightest movement to the position of the device\n\nIf your device is missing any sensors, the app will still work perfectly well without them.\n\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk, I cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

      "label": "Family tree research is becoming an ever more popular past time.  Normally all of your genealogy information is locked away on your computer at home which isn't much use when you are out and about researching local records, or visiting locations such as graveyards, ancestral homes, or family reunions.\n\nThis is where GedView comes in.  Carry around your entire family tree on your iPhone, iPod, or iPad and have all the data about your ancestors and even current descendants at your fingertips.\n\nYou can quickly check up on family relationships, dates / locations of events, and record new information.  Despite the name GedView is not just a viewing tool.  This includes taking photos, or video anywhere and anytime you like without needing to worry about a potentially costly internet connection.   If using an iPhone, or a cellular enabled iPad you can even record your current location to add to any event.\n\nIf your tree contains lots of images you can even use GedView as a slideshow, showing all the pictures related to a given event, person, source, family.  You can also play back any home movies you have in your tree.  Media support is not limited to photos/video.  Support is also included for any other file type your iPhone, iPod, or iPad is capable of opening.  This may be PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, mp3 files.  If you have an app installed that supports a specific document type and have a document of that type in your tree you will be able to view it via GedView.\n\nDo you have some separate branches in your tree that you haven't connected yet?  GedView allows you to store multiple trees so you can easily switch to view distinct branches.\n\nUnlike other apps no specific computer application is required, nor is a subscription to any website.  Instead standard GEDCOM files can be imported,  These can be encoded as ASCII, ANSI, ANSEL, UTF-8, or UTF-16 and can be added to GedView via WiFi, downloading from a website, via iTunes, or even opened from other apps such as Mail, Safari, Dropbox etc.\n\nWhile GedView is targeted towards GEDCOM 5.5.1 it will read in any version, and will also support many custom extensions used by other genealogy applications, and because GEDCOM hasn't been added as an after thought imports are fast and efficient.\n\nYou can even export GEDCOM files for sharing with family members or other researchers, or to transfer new information to your main computer.\n\nA sample family tree containing the British monarchy is included.\n\nIf you have any problems, or suggestions please get in touch via the support email address."

      "label": "Transform your life, repair DNA and create miracles in your life with this amazing meditation recording.\n\nThis is the third in a series of six meditation recordings by Glenn Harrold and Ali Calderwood, which are based upon the ancient Solfeggio musical scale. Each note in this scale has specific healing properties and this recording uses the third note, which resonates to a frequency of 528 Hz and is associated with the colour gold and the element of fire. \n\nThis frequency is described as the love frequency as it has the potential to bring about transformation and create miracles as well as repairing broken DNA. It can also help to overcome problems like fatigue, anxiety, control issues and negative thought patterns, all of which exist within the same vibrational energy.\n\nInterestingly, 528 Hz is the exact frequency used by genetic biochemists to repair broken DNA so our ancestors who used this scale for healing and transformation knew the power these frequencies held.\n\nGlenn Harrold's skilled vocal delivery and guided meditation combined with Ali Calderwood's deep and moving soundscapes tuned to 528 Hz combine to create an amazingly powerful meditation recording. By combining these sounds with a guided meditation, you also have the potential to release deep-rooted blockages. These compositions also contain an array of sacred instruments and sounds such as crystal bowls and didgeridoo and sacred chants, which work to further enhance the effects of the Solfeggio tones.\n\nThis App contains two audio tracks, the first you can use in the daytime as it will guide you back to full waking consciousness at the end. The second track will guide you into a deep sleep state at the end, which makes it ideal for using before you go to sleep at night. When you are instructed to repeat affirmations, connect with positive feelings (e.g. happiness, joy, love), this will help you absorb the suggestions on a deeper level. You don’t have to repeat the affirmations out loud but do make a strong connection with them.\n\nThis App includes:\n528 Hz Solfeggio Sonic Meditation Audio Track 1 – 37:11 (awake version)\n528 Hz Solfeggio Sonic Meditation Audio Track 2 – 42:42 (sleep version)\nMI 528 Hz Solfeggio Music Only Audio Track – 10:43\n\nSolfeggio Chart\nGlenn Harrold's Self-Hypnosis e-Book.\nAbout the Ancient Solfeggio Scale and Healing Sounds e-Book\nHow To Use This App e-Book\nAbout The Authors e-Book"

      "label": "Simply the best. Whether you're new to the I Ching or have used the book as an oracle, an aid to creativity, or a mirror of your subconscious, you'll love the clarity of writing, the intuition in the design, and the simplicity of use of this digital I Ching or Yi Jing. The modern, no-nonsense interface delivers new users straight to the basics: you ask a question, the I-Ching answers. For old souls who know the book well this app holds a wealth of features for deeper research. There's a journal where you can save and search your questions and readings, a notes area where you can record any length of text as context, a lookup library organized by number and trigram.  You can recreate any I Ching reading using decimal notation.  Original Chinese text included in an alternative selectable library at no additional charge. There are no ads, no subscriptions, no in-app purchases.   \n\nThe I Ching software engine emulates precisely the ancient yarrow stalk method, which was slightly more likely to cast yang than yin. A changing yin line is very rare using stalks,  but of equal probability to changing yang using coins. The ancient divination method uses stalks rather than coins. \n\nIf you prefer to count your own stalks or cast your own coins there's a manual hexagram builder to make your task easier. \n\nThe wisdom and philosophy of the ancient Chinese texts blend seamlessly with commentaries  that gently mix a dash of modern poetry, a pinch of humor, and cultural grace notes from the worlds of art, music, divination, and literature to bring you what many daily users have called the very best I-Ching app available. \n---------\nAmong my favourite reviews: \n\n\"Of all the versions I've used, your renderings of the Book of Changes are my heart-felt favorites. They have inspired me, made me laugh and cry and everything in between.\"\n\n“Pretty profound! This Iching app gave me spot-on advice. I've never paid for an app before, but I had a strong urge to get this one. I'm impressed! Not to sound all new-age but I totally laughed out loud at the reading it gave me, it was like it was sitting here looking over my shoulder and telling me exactly what I needed to know about my grumpy husband. P.S. Grumpy husband called and apologized right when I finished reading my reading.\"\n\n\"Carl Jung would have been happy to have this Yi Jing on his phone - great to use, unfussy, untechy, respectful of the original. The journal feature is great for storing readings and referring back. Well done!\"\n---------\nAll of us sometimes need a sympathetic ear and wise guidance, whether it's in matters of romance or finance: the I-Ching can become a companion along life’s journey like no other. It's a book that helps you explore questions and, if you're lucky, find answers: Whether you believe it's because the book is an oracle or the answers are simply unearthed from your subconscious -- the book's true magic lies in its ability to be a helpful guide (sometimes astoundingly so) to all these different forms of curiosity.   \n\nFollowing the tradition of Baynes and countless interpreters of the original texts, I've written commentaries which borrow words and inspiration from a multitude of sources; Bob Dylan, Lao Tzu, Doctor Who, the Tarot, T.S. Eliot, King Kong, John Lennon, the Grateful Dead and Martin Luther King all make cameo appearances. The language, unlike so many translations, makes every attempt to be gender-neutral.\n\nI wanted the sparest interface possible. No fake parchment backgrounds, no gimmicky images of bamboo or cartoon sages with oracles and winning lottery numbers. I tried not to imitate materials in the real world, but to let this app be its own thing, at home in its digital divination space. \n\nI strived to create a quiet, reflective, slowed down experience in an environment that normally shouts.\n\nI hope you enjoy using this I-Ching app as much as I enjoy crafting it, improving it, and hearing from people who have found it helpful in their lives."

When its wisdom is sought with sincerity and sensitivity, this ancient Chinese oracle will promote success and good fortune and impart balance and perspective to your life. Its lasting popularity lies in the profound lessons it teaches about how reliance on one's higher qualities leads to life's greatest rewards: well-being, understanding, and peace of mind.  \n\nNow available as an elegantly designed and easy to use iOS app, it is both highly accessible to new users and a revelation to those long familiar with the text. Throw your own coins, or let the app cast for you, and make the wisdom of the sages your own. Includes a journal for recording your questions, results, and thoughts.\n\nBrian Browne Walker is the author of celebrated contemporary translations of the I Ching, Tao te Ching, Hua hu Ching, Wei wu Wei Ching, and Art of War which are published by Harper and St. Martin's Press and translated into over a dozen languages around the world. His \"I Ching, or Book of Changes\", long beloved for its clarity and accessibility, has received five star reviews on Amazon consistently for over a decade."

      "label": "周易纳甲信息预测法亦称“六爻预测法”、“火珠林法”,系中国正宗预测大法。周易纳甲信息预测法系给周易各卦中的各种因素输入五行信息后,根据卦中的五行生克、冲合扶拱及其与时空的信息关系,分析出所需预测事物的发展趋势和细节。周易纳甲信息预测法的特点是预测事物细致、缜密、周严、具体、信息规划性强,其预测模式呈公式化,随意性小,故其法极易掌握。宋、明、清的许多学者都认为,周易纳甲信息预测法源于西汉京房氏。京房是西汉的经学家,著有《京房易传》等多部研究易学的作品,后人称为“京房易”、“纳甲法”,及至清代,由王洪绪所著《卜筮正宗》一书对此法进行了系统总结“定型”,成为近代应用最广泛的一种易学预测方法。\n\n都说“装卦容易断卦”难,但是对于那些初学“纳甲预测”的人来说,装卦也并不容易,需要记很多东西,才能迅速把卦装好。如果不熟练的话,把一个卦完整装好,在纸上写下五行,六亲,六兽,伏卦和变卦至少也要十多分钟。“六爻装卦”程序使得装卦的步骤迅速缩短到几秒钟,你只要选择起卦日期,将每次摇卦的结果通过手指轻轻按动输入,然后点击“装卦”按钮就可迅速完成装卦工作。装卦后的信息包括:太岁,月建,日辰,旬空,月破,六亲,六兽,五行干支,以及可能出现的变卦和伏卦的五行干支信息。另外“六爻装卦”通过月建信息得出本月五行的旺相休囚死,并通过每个五行的文字颜色加以标注,使得五行旺相生克信息一目了然,极大地方便了预测人断卦。另外“六爻装卦”程序内置了“拍摄快照”的功能,你可以将装卦信息拍摄到 iphone/itouch 设备的照片库中,随时传输打印(装卦图底色为白色),配合 evernote 和邮件等程序可迅速将装卦图传给预测师加以断卦。\n\n可以说“六爻装卦”是一款比较完善的 iphone 装卦程序。\n\n特色:\n- 操作简单,只需要选择时间,输入钱币摇卦的结果,点击“装卦”按钮就可以完成。\n- 装卦自动完成,而且信息完整。包括了:太岁,月建,日辰,旬空,月破,起卦时间,起卦的原始结果(单拆交重),四时旺相休囚,伏卦变卦的五行干支,主卦伏卦的六亲六兽信息等等。\n- 内置拍摄快照功能,可将卦图拍摄到手机照片库中,方便打印传输给预测师加以判断。\n- 内置装卦图的说明,摇动钱币和拍摄快照的时候都有音效,形象生动。\n\n注:本程序只负责装卦,并不能断卦,是给广大“六爻纳甲预测法”的爱好者和预测师使用的。购买本软件者可以凭本程序快照卦图和我交流。\n \n\nLANGUAGES:\nChinese\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\nCompatible with iPhone and iPod Touch 2\nRequires iPhone OS 2.2 or later"

With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

      "label": "• MILLIONS OF HAPPY USERS can't be wrong! Just wake up and bring it away from your bed, AUTO-dismiss!\n• SMART, BEAUTIFUL and EASY-TO-USE\n\nWHAT OUR USERS SAID \n √ Finally! An alarm that irritates me enough to wake up\n √ Exceptional App!! This app is super super annoying... It really gets me out of bed\n √ Love it. It's the best alarm ever\n √ Great Alarm! Been having trouble getting up. No more!\n √ This app is so easy to use, and has all the perfect functions! I'll never be late again!\n\nFEATURED IN THE MEDIA\n √ Definitely one of the more “annoying” alarms to help you get up and out of bed in the morning. – AppAdvice.com\n √ If you are the kind of person who has a difficult time waking up after you’ve turned off your alarm, this app may help keep you from being late for work. - iDownloadBlog\n\nAlso in MacWorld NL, AppsRumors, AppChronicles, etc.\n\nHOW IT WORKS \n\nAs the name \"Step Out!\" implied, the only way you can turn off this alarm clock is STEPPING out of your bed (you still can snooze - in a limited duration). It uses advanced image recognition and step tracking technologies to check whether you’re far away from your bed. \n\nAfter ringing, the app asks you to capture another photo of a specified place, it should be where you usually be every time you wake up, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, ...

      "label": "Stop smoking forever with this superb high quality hypnosis App by Glenn Harrold. Glenn is one of the world's best-selling hypnotherapists with multi-million sales of his Apps, CDs, MP3s and 7 self-help books.\n\nGlenn was a regular 20-a-day smoker until he quit forever in 1987 and he understands the smoking habit from personal experience. He has created these two unique hypnosis recordings to help you to become a non-smoker by reprogramming your unconscious mind. This way, being a non-smoker will feel completely normal and natural to you. \n\nOn both hypnosis audio tracks you will be safely guided into a very deep state of mental and physical relaxation and then given multiple post-hypnotic suggestions that you don't smoke, and that you will remain a non-smoker forever. Glenn's utilises his skilled hypnotherapy techniques to help you break all past associations with smoking, which completely removes the struggle from stopping smoking. You will also be given positive suggestions and affirmations to prevent you from putting on weight or substituting any other negative patterns of behaviour in place of the smoking habit. In fact when you stop smoking your motivation and desire to keep fit and healthy will become stronger than ever. \n\nQuitting Smoking is easy with hypnotherapy, as this method is uniquely effective in programming the mind to overcome the addiction to cigarettes and nicotine. Glenn's highly acclaimed hypnosis techniques and production will help you achieve this goal in a safe and natural way. \n\nThis App Includes:\n\nHypnosis Audio Tracks\n• Stop Smoking Now 31:31 mins\n• Stop Smoking Forever 28:22 mins\n• 12 Minute Sleep Booster\n\neBooks by Glenn Harrold\n• De-Stress - The 8 Golden Rules\n• The Ultimate Guide To Self Hypnosis\n• How To Use This App\n• About The Author\n\nStop Smoking features two powerful hypnotherapy sessions containing:\n• Glenn's highly acclaimed hypnosis techniques guiding you into a deep state of mental and physical relaxation.\n• The very latest state-of-the-art recording technology.\n• Background sound effects recorded in specific musical keys and frequencies to compliment the hypnotic suggestions and enhance the deep trance effect.\n• Hypnotic echoed backing vocals panning from left to right across the stereo range - a unique hypnotic effect.\n• Powerful subliminal suggestions embedded under the fade out music to maximise the overall effectiveness of the recordings.\n\nGlenn has over 20 years experience as a full-time hypnotherapist and works with many celebrity clients. He has appeared on TV a number of times and his successful hypnotherapy sessions are often featured in newspaper and magazine articles. Here are some of the many endorsements Glenn's receives from celebrities and journalists amongst others.\n\n\"I have downloaded - Deep Sleep, Lose Weight and stop smoking... I no longer smoke, I have lost 18 Lbs... and I have some of the best and deepest sleep ever... I swear by these CDs... My thanks to you Mr. Harrold...and anyone who doesn't believe me can drop me an email anytime, and I will confirm this for them.\"\nDetective Anthony La Femina, New York City Police Dept -15 Years Joint Terrorism Taskforce, Surveillance Division. Email: inklinations1@optonline.net\n\n\"I was startled by the effectiveness of this self-hypnosis audio\"\nSophie Campbell - The Sunday Telegraph \n\n\"I did feel pretty rough for a few days (after my hypnotherapy session with Glenn) as my body was missing the sugar, but that soon passed and I feel I'm finally free of my sugar cravings and chocolate addiction! I tried a piece of chocolate to see what happened and it tasted horrible!\"\nAndrea Mclean (TV Presenter)"

You can search by city or area or long tap on the custom map to drop a pin on a chosen location.\n\nWhat we display:\n- sunrise time\n- sunset time\n- first light time (dawn)\n- last light time (twilight)\n- precise location (latitude/longitude)\n- a countdown of the amount of daylight left in the day until last-light\n- countdown until the first light of the new day (night)\n\nSun Intervals relies on GPS and built-in algorithms, so it does not use your mobile data or require an internet connection.\n\nWhenever there is no location signal, the application uses the last automatically saved location.\n\nSun Intervals can be helpful to photographers & film production crews, astronomers, astrophotographers, hikers, campers, sailors, pilots, travellers.\n\nReligious and yoga followers can benefit from the application as well to observe special requirements."

      "label": "The Spectre Box is the Official Haunted Finders Spirit Box App. Used by the Haunted Finders team and created as an affordable app that you can use for genuine paranormal research. To see this app is action please search Haunted Finders on YouTube.\n\nHow it works:\n\nThe Spectre Box is a sound bank Ghost Box containing over 3000 audio clips which are taken from AM FM CB CW VHF UHF, Morse, various Ghost Box recordings & phonetic audio from single words in many different languages some have even been overlaid & echo'd\n\nEach of the audio clips are no more than one second in length therefore making it very hard to create a full sentence. Because of this any words coming through should be totally unrelated to any question a person may ask. Therefore it should be pretty much impossible to have an intelligent conversation with someone or something. This is what makes this app so interesting. Spirits are supposed to manipulate electrical devices and use that energy to speak and that is how this app works. If a spirit wants to make contact they will use the phonetic and audio sounds to form words in order to form an intelligent conversation.\n\nThere really is no way to judge what will be said at the same time a question is asked. The best thing about it is because it uses more phonetic sound clips, we should be able to get foreign language usage & responses from it too.\n\nRECORDING YOUR SESSIONS\n\nWe fully advise that you always record or video your Ghost Box sessions using this app. 9 times out of 10 you will miss a lot of the intelligent responses in the moment and you will be shocked at some of the things you will hear on playback.\n\nJust be warned this app is not a toy or for the faint hearted, this can be a terrifying experience if you have never touched a Ghost Box before or even attempted spirit communication. So we recommend researching Ghost Box’s & spirit communication before deciding to try one for real.\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk. We cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

      "label": "WatcheePro is a comprehensive app for watch collectors and enthusiasts that tracks watch collection information.\n\nDEVELOPERS\nWatcheePro is developed by Anssi Hakkarainen and Brian Hall. Anssi is a database developer, lifetime programmer, and watch enthusiast. Brian is a computer science professor, engineer, and watchmaker. \n\nSTORE WATCH DETAILS\nSet watch details including category, origin (country flags), status, dimensions, serial and reference numbers, materials, movement, complications (up to six), pricing, and much more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE WATCH PLATES\nChange colors of plate, crown, info frame, and font independently to match watch design characteristics. Animated crown, pusher, and gears show watch info.\n\nTRACK WATCH STATISTICS\nTrack watch collection statistics such as wear rates, accuracy measurements, service history, and compare individual watch specs to your watch collection averages. View a summary of your entire collection.\n\nTIMEGRAPHER ACCURACY MEASUREMENTS\nStore results of timegrapher measurements including rate, beat error and amplitude in six positions. WatcheePro automatically calculates averages and deltas based on rate, beat error, and amplitude. Fully-wound and 24-hours running can be compared.\n\nWEAR RATES\nTrack which watches you wear most often, how many days since last wear, and cost per wear. Watch statistics are just a tap away.\nWear rates can be examined for the whole watch collection and we've also added the per watch effective wear rate, which automatically calculates a percentage for each watch regarding how many times it has been worn compared to the days it has been owned.\n\nUSEFUL AND ENTERTAINING\nExport your collection to a spreadsheet. Create PDFs of your watches for insurance or selling purposes. Earn badges for entering watch info and for wear counts. Can't decide what to wear...let WatcheePro pick!\n\nHISTORY LOG\nIf enabled in the settings, log actions regarding watches such as when a watch is added to the collection or sold.\n\nKEEPER RATE AND SELLER RATE\nWatcheePro tracks Keeper & Seller rates for your watches by comparing a specific watch against the other watches in your collection. WatcheePro compares the characteristics of your watch against the averages across your collection.\n\nWATCH COLLECTION SUMMARY DETAILS\nNumber of watches in collection, number of sold watches, total cost of watches in collection, total retail cost of watches in collection, total cost of sold watches, profit from sold watches, results of watch deals, average diameter, average thickness, average lug-to-lug, and total weight.\n\nAPP DEVELOPMENT\nWatcheePro stores all data on your device and does not need an internet connection. The app is developed by two watch enthusiasts and programmers. WatcheePro is regularly updated with new features and we welcome feedback."

I love it!\" - nurse195829\n\n\"I am a totally blind knitter and use voiceover to read my iPhone screen. I have long wanted a row counter that was accessible to me. I found it! Works perfectly, and the sounds confirm that I have added or subtracted a row.

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

You can set it up with the name of your baby, and the app looks differently depending on whether you have a baby boy or baby girl.\n\nSECURE AND RELIABLE\nReliability and privacy are our biggest concerns. You always know the battery level of the baby station, and stability of the internet connection is carefully monitored. In the unlikely event, something goes amiss, you’re notified immediately.\n\nNote about privacy\nWe respect your privacy and that’s why we do not store any data transferred through Baby Monitor 3G or any personal information.

Helping little ones learn how to settle themselves independently to sleep without the need to feed be rocked or a dummy replaced every time it falls out. So that when they wake in the night or early from a nap they are able to go back to sleep themselves. \nA personalised graph showing your baby’s sleep progress by day.\n\n\nFULL OF ADVICE \n    • Bedtime routine \n    • Naps how many and for what ages \n    • What to do when teething or poorly \n    • When not to start sleep coaching \n    • How long does sleep training take \n    • What to do when away from home \n    • How soon will I see progress \n\n\nONCE DOWNLOADED THE APP CAN BE USED AT ANY TIME, SO IF THINGS SLIP AND OLD HABITS OR NEW HABITS START, THEN LOG BACK IN AND HAVE THE SUPPORT AND TOOLS TO GET THINGS BACK ON TRACK.

Designed to create a deeply relaxed state  of mind and empowered labour and birth. \n\nCreated by women for women, iHypnobirth, will help you feel positive about birthing your baby. \n\niHypnobirth contains tailored meditations for self-hypnosis and positive birth affirmations each created specifically for labour and birth.\n\niHypnobirth features the following hypnosis tracks; \n\n-Guided relaxation for self-hypnosis \nA guided hypnosis that prepares the mind for a relaxed state of mind and calm birth \n\n-Guided meditation with positive birth affirmations audio\nA longer relaxation with positive birth affirmations that will resonate deep within the sub-conscious\n\n-Positive birth affirmations \nThese are positive statements about pregnancy and birth which resonate within the sub-conscious allowing you to embrace a positive birth experience \n\niHypnobirth was created by Psychologist & hypnatal practitioner Dr Alex McKay and NLP trained Charlotte Maslen. With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

This is an attempt in which I don’t think would have been possible with my own effort and intellect but could do it by the Grace of Sri Sri Radha Madhava and offer this creation in the Lotus feet of Sri Radha Madhava with the hope that it will help Vaishnavas observe fast in the different locations of this globe.\nI know with all the work that has gone into it there must be still shortcomings and mistakes for which I seek apologies in the feet of Vaishnava jans and request to verify these dates with your local temples from where you have been already referring for these times and dates. \n\nThis app is based on the rules put forth by Goswamis for deciding the dates of Ekadasi and Mahadvadasi fast.\nOnly Vaishnava Ekadashi is Supported!\n\nTechnical Features of the app :\n*The app is designed to show the Upcoming Ekadashi Vrat Observing date & Parana timings as soon as you open the app.\n*Katha for the Ekadashi’s are also available\n*Selection of current location can be done manually (latitude, longitude) or by using GPS or web database.\n*Notification support is available with different frequency settings\n*Home-screen widget helps to know the Upcoming Ekadashi Fast on the go\n*Year Calendar View is available wherein all the Ekadasi Fasts are sorted by months\n*Rules of observing Ekadashi fast are included\n*Sunrise time and Brahma Muhurta Timings for the selected locations are also displayed\n*Easy to use UI\n\nYou can feel free to contact us at - contact@itsraghav.com for any suggestions. \n\nDownload Ekadasi App Now\n\nHare Krishna"

      "label": "3 years in the making. Now featuring pro quality reverb, the famous \"Hindi\" based bank D, upgraded audio engine now recording mono wav 44.1 files, a whole new mode, reversed playback and more.\n\nThe learning curve for 3.0 is pretty steep for the new user.\nYou can also get help from me and over 1,000 other users worldwide at: www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers\n\nDEMO VIDEO IS IN PRODUCTION.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THIS SOFTWARE IS CPU INTENSIVE AND RUNS BEST ON NEWER DEVICES. \n\nECHOVOX System all-in-one Echo based Real Time EVP recording system from the creator of SpiritVox.\n\nEchoVox is a real-time amplified recording system used to create a bed of random chaotic noise using random phonetics, microphone input and a natural loop recording echo. Delay time can be set from anywhere to 0-10 seconds. This means what you are hearing is the actual audio being recorded to disk in real-time, as it happens.\n\nEcho has been shown to contribute to EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon)\n\nNote: The Echo is not a digital effect added to the sound. It is a loop of the actual recording. An external/BlueTooth speaker is recommended for the best results, also the louder the better.\n\nFEATURES:\nECHO WITHOUT RECORDING\n6 CHANNELS OF RANDOM PHONETIC AUDIO\n4 SOUND BANKS.\nSTUDIO QUALITY REVERB\n44.1 WAV REAL-TIME AUDIO RECORDING\nNEW \"BURST\" MODE*\nNEW AUTO BLEND/AUTO SHUFFLE\nMULTIPLE DELAY SETTINGS\nMIC GAIN INPUT CONTROL\nPLAY,FF,REW,SLOW,SPEED UP,REVERSE AUDIO FILES WITHIN APP FOR REVIEW\nUPLOAD TO SOUNDCLOUD\nFILE BROWSER\nNAME SESSION AT START\nCUSTOM REVERB PRESETS (.ievrp) CAN BE SAVED AND TRADED.\n\n*Random burst of random sounds from random banks for a random amount of time\n\n\nCONTROLS:\nEach channel has independent playback speed control + on/off.\n\nMic gain controls microphone input volume\n\n\"Auto Blend\" \"Shuffle\" blends across the 6 random audio channels\n\nEcho starts recording to disk.\n\nTHEORY: This is the result of years of experiments in the field, it is still a work in progress. The echo is actually a chaotic loop of the chopped up vocal samples and environmental sounds. A virtual soup of sound and frequencies impossible to predict.\n\nThis system has been used and tested WORLDWIDE. On live television in India and South America. Featured on televisions \"Ghost Trail\" and \"Seekers\" and more. EchoVox is simply the #1 most trusted and widely used app by both pro's and \"armchair\" paranormal investigators.\n\nEchovox is used by Barry Fitzgerald of TV's Ghost Hunters International and Bill Murphy of TV's Fact or Faked Paranormal files, Chris Flemming of Psychic Kids and Robb Demarest of Ghost Hunters International and other leaders in the paranormal field.\n\nEchoVox is NOT just an app, it is not a toy. \n\nIt is for use by serious investigators and is not for the casual user.\n\nThe best way to learn more about EchoVox:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/bigbeardaudio\n\nJOIN THE FB GROUP: www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers\n\nI support my work 100% and want to help you learn to use this correctly and help with any issues.

I started using this app and she was accident free the first day. It's very accurate nearly to the minute she has to go potty. I emailed the info to the puppy class trainer. It's very easy to use.\n\nFantastic App!  - byHot K - May 6, 2014\nI LOVE this app. I really needed something to help me make heads or tails out of mine & my new puppies day so we could have a smooth, fun house training process. Well, this app provides that! It certainly delivers what it promises & more! The app is easy to use & fun. It sorts out all the patterns of our new Sproodle & I feel less stressed. Def give this app a try if you haven't house trained a dog before, or maybe even if you have :)\n\nGreat tool!  - bymanwdaplan - Apr 24, 2014\nAmazingly accurate at predicting my dogs needs. Also, a very simple and clean (and cute) interface that makes the training process much less frustrating.\nLove this app! \n\nbyJonasfann1 - Apr 20, 2015 - Really very cool for any owner of a new puppy!

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

      "label": "These beautiful cards capture the essence of the life-changing, best-selling book Ask and It Is Given. You will experience an enhancing of your personal power, which may, at first, seem illogical or even magical, as the Energy Stream from which these cards have come dovetails with the true essence of your own being.\n\nAs you return for frequent visits to these beautiful cards, you will begin to notice a definite closing of the gap between where you are and where you want to be on all subjects that are important to you.\nFEATURES:\n- Browse Ask And It Is Given cards anywhere, anytime on your iOS device*\n- Save cards to review at any time*\n- Email cards to yourself or share with a friend*\n\nAbout the Author:\nExcited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986.\nRecognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life.\n\nUsing their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences.\n\nIn November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry.\nPeople are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos.\nAbraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self."

      "label": "Self-Improvement and Mindfulness Training for Spiritual Awakening\r\n \r\nkoii media, LLC, Los Altos Hills, CA\r\n \r\n* The Original Course in Miracles Narrated App\r\n \r\nDescription / Features:\r\n \r\nWhat seems to be causing the fear and anxiety in the world is a case of mistaken perception. Joy and inner peace are always there within us.\r\n \r\nA Course in Miracles is a non-dualistic study program, often quoted by famous teachers such as Marianne Williamson and Eckhart Tolle. The Course is designed to bring a consistent state of happiness and peace to the student through the application of its principles. Each lesson opens new realms of understanding and new pearls of wisdom as one listens and continues the daily Course Work. \r\n \r\nThe teaching can be summed up in this Course passage:\r\n\r\nNothing real can be threatened.\r\nNothing unreal exists.\r\nHerein lies the peace of God.\r\n \r\nIn the 365 daily lessons in the Course, one learns how to clear the egoic debris from the mind and trust in Spirit. One learns to let go of judgment which would distract from the beauty of Truth that reveals itself in each person and in each moment. This is when the miraculous reveals itself. It is a subtle, gentle and profound process, rooted in Christian mysticism but containing elements of psychology and other non-dualistic teachings such as Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism.\r\n \r\nThe goal is not to deny any reality in the world, but to understand the mistaken perception so it may be dissolved.\r\n \r\nThis app has many intuitive features that allow one to study and practice this profound wisdom with ease. Simply navigate to your day's lesson to listen while walking, resting... wherever and whenever is best for you. The entire coursework is also onscreen if you wish to read along with the narration. The app facilitates audio or written annotations and even the opportunity to connect to ACIM communities. \r\n \r\nFeatures:\r\n \r\n* High-quality recordings \r\n* 365 beautifully narrated lessons (plus Introductions and Epilogue)\r\n* Professional, user-friendly design \r\n* Practice reminders can be set throughout the day at any intervals \r\n* Affirmations or notes can be recorded easily within each lesson\r\n* Daily lesson view allows you to jump to your current daily lesson instantly\r\n* Search for a lesson by keyword or phrase\r\n* Backwards and Forwards functions facilitate finding the exact spot you wish to hear in the lesson for review or further contemplation\r\n* Easy scroll view to quickly find any lesson or introduction in the Workbook\r\n* Free access to Facebook study group for support and community\r\n* No wi-fi or cellular connection needed to play audio lessons so you can take it with you anywhere you roam... just like a book!"

Every day for the rest of your life you will receive a positive message, beautifully presented.  Each message has an expanded summary of that day’s affirmation.  The message will be sent to your Apple device 3 times during the course of the day - morning, afternoon and evening.   This will provide you with the opportunity to both absorb and more importantly apply the daily message.  \n\nHappy Hints has been created for anyone looking to cultivate a happier frame of mind amidst the challenges of modern life.  Sadly, we are all moving too quickly and barely have the time to process what we are thinking and feeling.  This leaves most of us with a happiness deficit.  So whether you are a busy executive burdened by the demands of meetings and deadlines, a mother managing a home and looking after your children or you are just trying to find ways of managing the stress of life in the 21st century then Happy Hints is definitely for you!\n\nThe Happy Hints app also includes literally hundreds of audio-visual and written resources covering topics ranging from: how to manage anxiety, anger, depression and stress through to building self-confidence, developing a positive mental attitude and mindfulness tips.  \n\nThe beauty of this application is that it is simple to use and provides you with an encyclopedic resource at your fingertips.... which will serve up countless insights and invaluable inspirations when you most need them.  All the information is presented in an easily digestible format and you’ll soon find that Happy Hints will become an indispensable friend!  \n \nWe all have one thing in common.... our need to be happy.  Happiness is a virtue, but it’s really important to understand that it is also a skill.  A skill is something you can learn and develop and so happiness is something you can practise and the more you practise it the happier you will become.  \n \nWhy not let Happy Hints help you to do just that!"

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

It also provides a description for each phase, sign and mansion.

Mansions were used by different cultures from the time immemorial, they tell for what a particular day is good or not so good.\n\nTo calculate the times, iLuna uses the time zone of the device on which it runs, so if your iPhone or iPod touch shows your current time correctly, iLuna's information is precise too.\n\nOnce any of the events reported by iLuna happens, you will get a notification, provided you allowed the app to send you notifications."

TRÅFRI Disco gives you the whole spectrum available on the system.\nBecause we connect direct, there is virtually no delay between the command and the light response like HomeKit.\n\nTRÅDFRI Disco is the best in recognizing your favorite music through the microphone. Even at low volume levels changes are accurately detected and transformed into a lightshow. It's the only TRÅDFRI App with a real fast Stroboscope! (Strobe)\n\nSome detailed features:\n\n\n****Audio options****\n- Microphone sensitivity sliders let you control how often music is turned into light (change)  and control silence detection. (dB)\n- Brightness control sliders manage the maximum and minimum brightness of your disco setup\n- Indicators to show when your thresholds are being 'hit' by the music. \n- LED indicator for TEMPO tap button indicating current BPM. \n-> Auto Disco (strobe, transition style)\n\n****Color Control and Custom Color Themes****\n- User configurable color themes.\n- Color control slider helps you set the saturation of bulbs.\n- Color range control\n- Transform any image from your library in a color theme.\n\n****Strobe****\n- New Color Strobe.\n- Rainbow Strobe.\n- Classic White Strobe\n- Custom Color Strobe \n- Strobe your own Custom Color theme\n\n-> Smooth, Snap or Mix Transition.

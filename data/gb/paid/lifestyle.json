When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

If you move the device after it has been calibrated you will need to recalibrate, simply click the \"Back\" button, move the device to a new area, then click \"Calibrate\" again.\n\nThere are 12 music box songs that his app randomly chooses from when it calibrates.\n\nThe sensors used are:\n\nMagnetometer - This senses Magnetic and Electromagnet fields around the device\nAccelerometer - This senses any device movement and the slightest vibrations around the device\nBarometer - Detects any change in the Ambient Air Pressure around the device\nCompass - Detects the slightest change in magnetic interference to Magnetic North\nGyroScope - Detects the slightest movement of the device\nOrientation - Detects the slightest movement to the position of the device\n\nIf your device is missing any sensors, the app will still work perfectly well without them.\n\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk, I cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "NEWS:\nFamily Tracker was used to locate a missing child - see news report on: http://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-app-missing-idUSBRE8460GZ20120507\n\n***SUPPORT NOTICE**** \nWe do help everyone who contacts us via our iphone@logsat.com email address, but unfortunately most users give bad ratings without ever contacting us for support. Please do contact us if you have any issues, we're always there to help! \n*************** \n\nFamily Tracker allows you to track your wife, husband, children and fiancée. You can now find out where they are, at anytime, as long as they have their phones with them. Family Tracker is available for other platforms as well, so you can track (and be tracked by) other devices as well - check our website for more details. \n\nPlease note that starting with the new iOS4 and supported hardware, Family Tracker runs in the background at all times, and, unlike previous versions of Family Tracker, user intervention is **NOT** needed for you to track them. Family Tracker runs at all times, continuously updating the GPS location of the device. Even if the iPhone is rebooted, Family Tracker will automatically resume tracking and updating its position! \n\nSo how does this work? \n\nSimple. Install Family Tracker on the iPhone/iPad you want to track. From then on, you can use either a web browser or via the Family Tracker app itself installed on your own iPhone/iPad to locate your family member. \n\nIf the device you wish to track does not support multitasking (for example, older iPhones 3G, iPads), you can still use Family Tracker to locate the family member. Using the web or your own iPhone, you will be able to \"ping\" the other iPhone. This is done by sending the other iPhone a (free) “Apple Push Notification” which will cause an alert to sound on your family member’s iPhone, even if the phone in is stand-by, just as would happen if the iPhone receives an SMS. As soon as this alert is acknowledged, their GPS position will be recorded, and their location will be updated on a map. If you are using an iPhone yourself to track them, you will be sent a Push Notification to inform you that the family member has accepted your \"ping\". These notifications will be automatically re-sent every 60 seconds until they are acknowledged. If the recipient is trying to ignore them or does not hear them, this repetition will help acknowledging them. \n\nFamily Tracker does not need to know your iPhone cell number to function, as it does not send SMS messages for notifications. Your email address is instead used to send free Apple Push Notifications to the iPhones being tracked. These notifications are free, specific to our Family Tracker application, and work anywhere in the world as long as the iPhone and/or iTouch being tracked has internet access via the cellular network or WiFi. \n\nNotice: ***Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.*** For this reason, we strongly recommend users to configure Family Tracker to use the \"Driving Only\" accuracy in the GPS setting. This special mode updates the GPS location only when a significant location change occurs, which results in a tremendous gain in battery life.\n\nAdditional pro features, such as the ability to see the past locations for the previous 2 weeks, and the ability to set geofences so you are alerted when users that you track enter or leave certain areas are available via an optional iTunes subscription.\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions are available for either $1.99/month, or $5.99/3 months, or $9.99/6 months or $19.99/year. Privacy policy & terms of use: http://logsat.com/family-tracker-privacy.asp"

This moment is your life”\n\nWith the latest Meditation and Relaxation techniques, this app will ease every muscle in your body, offering you Complete Relaxation.\n\nBeautifully read by Heather Prince who is a daughter, sister, Aunty, Mum of 3 and Grandma of 3.  Having experienced grief of divorce and loss of friends and family, she understands that each stage of life brings different challenges.  At times she believed happiness would be reached when she achieved a certain weight, when the kids were more independent; when someone else was happy; when she moved house, when she bought “those amazing shoes”... and she wishes she knew then what she knows now, as a teacher of mindfulness relaxation and Spiritual Response Therapist.\n\nHappiness is not just about money, fame or success.  It’s about positive experiences, feelings of contentedness and peace of mind.\n\nTrue happiness is something that lasts for long and not just a sudden boost of mood.\n\nTherefore, after working with many people who have been seeking HAPPINESS, Heather has put together this visualisation so that you can go easily into a state of deep relaxation and feel the happiness within.\n\nMeditation needs to be experienced, and you need to develop over a period of time to really experience what it’s all about because it doesn’t happen overnight. So decide your level of commitment now. She suggests you listen to this meditation every day for at least the next 6 weeks and it will result in feeling real happiness... the sort that makes your heart glow and gives you the reason to get up in the morning.  \n\n\nWe're very proud of this app and hope it will leave you HAPPY!"

An alarm that irritates me enough to wake up\n √ Exceptional App!! This app is super super annoying... It really gets me out of bed\n √ Love it. It's the best alarm ever\n √ Great Alarm! Been having trouble getting up. No more!\n √ This app is so easy to use, and has all the perfect functions! I'll never be late again!\n\nFEATURED IN THE MEDIA\n √ Definitely one of the more “annoying” alarms to help you get up and out of bed in the morning. – AppAdvice.com\n √ If you are the kind of person who has a difficult time waking up after you’ve turned off your alarm, this app may help keep you from being late for work. - iDownloadBlog\n\nAlso in MacWorld NL, AppsRumors, AppChronicles, etc.\n\nHOW IT WORKS \n\nAs the name \"Step Out!\" implied, the only way you can turn off this alarm clock is STEPPING out of your bed (you still can snooze - in a limited duration). It uses advanced image recognition and step tracking technologies to check whether you’re far away from your bed. \n\nAfter ringing, the app asks you to capture another photo of a specified place, it should be where you usually be every time you wake up, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, ... So you just take a photo and do your routine work like washing your face or preparing breakfast. \n\nAnother alternative is using the step counter, which simplifies this process into just nothing. You wake up and go to wherever you want with the device. After reaching enough number of steps, the alarm will automatically turn off. It’s simply a smarter alarm with no additional action., You’ll love using it from the very first time. \n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n\n- MUSIC ALARM \no Wake up with your favorite songs\no Listen to them when moving\n\n- FULLY FUNCTIONAL ALARM \no Easy setup with hand-drawn mini-game\no Repeating rule for daily, weekly alarms \no Built-in alarm sounds \no Snooze, Vibrate, Fade-in & Volume for the perfect experience \n\n- MOTION TRACKING \no Innovative motion tracking system to sense your steps\no Smart anti-cheat system to make sure that you are stepping\n\n**IMPORTANT: We do not encourage our users to step so fast when you are not totally awake, this app will just recognize the steps when you aren’t walking too fast.\n\n- IMAGE RECOGNITION\no State-of-the-art image recognizing engine\no Can match both horizontal and vertical pictures\no Strict image comparison to assure you’re leaving your bed and your eyes opened wide enough to take the right picture.\n\n**HINT: Choose a scene that has a stable light condition for better matching results.\n\n- SLEEP TIMER \no Fall asleep with music \no Auto-lock and ready for next alarm \n\n- FLASHLIGHT \no Easy to find way through the dark when you are stepping\n\n- CLOCK \no Full feature clock \no Show/hide seconds, 24 hour format, …"

Even at low volume levels changes are accurately detected and transformed into a lightshow. It's the only TRÅDFRI App with a real fast Stroboscope! (Strobe)\n\nSome detailed features:\n\n\n****Audio options****\n- Microphone sensitivity sliders let you control how often music is turned into light (change)  and control silence detection. (dB)\n- Brightness control sliders manage the maximum and minimum brightness of your disco setup\n- Indicators to show when your thresholds are being 'hit' by the music. \n- LED indicator for TEMPO tap button indicating current BPM. \n-> Auto Disco (strobe, transition style)\n\n****Color Control and Custom Color Themes****\n- User configurable color themes.\n- Color control slider helps you set the saturation of bulbs.\n- Color range control\n- Transform any image from your library in a color theme.\n\n****Strobe****\n- New Color Strobe.\n- Rainbow Strobe.\n- Classic White Strobe\n- Custom Color Strobe \n- Strobe your own Custom Color theme\n\n-> Smooth, Snap or Mix Transition. For selecting soft or crazy wild fast transition. Warning for the epileptic! \n\n\n- Mood Tab. Control any mood with these new great features: \n-> Select transition/cycle time between selected lights from 1 second to 10 minutes! \n-> Choose a theme or select a color range \n-> Create your own color theme\n-> Choose to change all bulbs to the same color \n-> Or never change to the same color \n-> Or sometimes \n-> Or Frequent \n-> Shake for random setting within current theme (option) \n-> Overall Mood Brightness Control \n-> Overall Mood Color Intensity Control \n-> Sleeptimer for Mood mode \n\n\nTRÅDFRI Disco listens to an external sound source.

      "label": "3 years in the making. Now featuring pro quality reverb, the famous \"Hindi\" based bank D, upgraded audio engine now recording mono wav 44.1 files, a whole new mode, reversed playback and more.\n\nThe learning curve for 3.0 is pretty steep for the new user.\nYou can also get help from me and over 1,000 other users worldwide at: www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers\n\nDEMO VIDEO IS IN PRODUCTION.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THIS SOFTWARE IS CPU INTENSIVE AND RUNS BEST ON NEWER DEVICES. \n\nECHOVOX System all-in-one Echo based Real Time EVP recording system from the creator of SpiritVox.\n\nEchoVox is a real-time amplified recording system used to create a bed of random chaotic noise using random phonetics, microphone input and a natural loop recording echo. Delay time can be set from anywhere to 0-10 seconds. This means what you are hearing is the actual audio being recorded to disk in real-time, as it happens.\n\nEcho has been shown to contribute to EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon)\n\nNote: The Echo is not a digital effect added to the sound. It is a loop of the actual recording. An external/BlueTooth speaker is recommended for the best results, also the louder the better.\n\nFEATURES:\nECHO WITHOUT RECORDING\n6 CHANNELS OF RANDOM PHONETIC AUDIO\n4 SOUND BANKS.\nSTUDIO QUALITY REVERB\n44.1 WAV REAL-TIME AUDIO RECORDING\nNEW \"BURST\" MODE*\nNEW AUTO BLEND/AUTO SHUFFLE\nMULTIPLE DELAY SETTINGS\nMIC GAIN INPUT CONTROL\nPLAY,FF,REW,SLOW,SPEED UP,REVERSE AUDIO FILES WITHIN APP FOR REVIEW\nUPLOAD TO SOUNDCLOUD\nFILE BROWSER\nNAME SESSION AT START\nCUSTOM REVERB PRESETS (.ievrp) CAN BE SAVED AND TRADED.\n\n*Random burst of random sounds from random banks for a random amount of time\n\n\nCONTROLS:\nEach channel has independent playback speed control + on/off.\n\nMic gain controls microphone input volume\n\n\"Auto Blend\" \"Shuffle\" blends across the 6 random audio channels\n\nEcho starts recording to disk.\n\nTHEORY: This is the result of years of experiments in the field, it is still a work in progress. The echo is actually a chaotic loop of the chopped up vocal samples and environmental sounds. A virtual soup of sound and frequencies impossible to predict.\n\nThis system has been used and tested WORLDWIDE. On live television in India and South America. Featured on televisions \"Ghost Trail\" and \"Seekers\" and more. EchoVox is simply the #1 most trusted and widely used app by both pro's and \"armchair\" paranormal investigators.\n\nEchovox is used by Barry Fitzgerald of TV's Ghost Hunters International and Bill Murphy of TV's Fact or Faked Paranormal files, Chris Flemming of Psychic Kids and Robb Demarest of Ghost Hunters International and other leaders in the paranormal field.\n\nEchoVox is NOT just an app, it is not a toy. \n\nIt is for use by serious investigators and is not for the casual user.\n\nThe best way to learn more about EchoVox:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/bigbeardaudio\n\nJOIN THE FB GROUP: www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers\n\nI support my work 100% and want to help you learn to use this correctly and help with any issues. THE BEST METHOD FOR SUPPORT IS TO FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER @spiritvoxapp or at www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers"

I can keep all my project counts in one place!\" - Anna706\n\n\"I do one project at a time that would require a counter. This is the first I’ve seen that is really easy! I love it!\" - nurse195829\n\n\"I am a totally blind knitter and use voiceover to read my iPhone screen. I have long wanted a row counter that was accessible to me. I found it! Works perfectly, and the sounds confirm that I have added or subtracted a row. The only thing that voiceover users want to know is that you need to double tap the pencil icon in order to make the project name text field active. This app is moving to the front page of my home screen! Thank you! Simplicity often means accessibility to me. Awesome!\" - ThaiFoodLady\n\n\"Its simplicity is great\" - hsbz. hsn \n\n\"i got it because i always forget to keep track of my stitches... it was so easy to use, i didn’t like the noise it made when you clicked it but i just turned it off. i also love how your able to choose what color you want!\" - milembh\n\n\"After trying several counter apps, this is by far by favorite.\" - H408\n\n\"I was looking for a counter app. Nothing fancy as I didn’t was one that took up a lot of memory on my device. Thus app is PERFECT. It’s super easy to use and a bit customizable too. If you are looking for a basic counter app, look no further. Thus app will meet your needs!\" - JB45840"

With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "QuiltPaper creates graph paper for quilters. More than just a 1/4” grid — a tap does much of the ‘drafting' needed for quilt design by adding borders, sashing, cornerstones, diagonals for triangles, and more.\n\nStandard graph paper grids are included. For example, design an on-point quilt by starting with included Diagonal Paper. Make your own expensive, hard-to-find specialty papers and EPP templates: hexagon, diamond, triangle, HST & HRT templates, tumbler, polygon, eight and six point star, honeycomb (Lucy Boston), jewel, kite, brick, log cabin, square, circle, arc, and pinwheel by adding InApp purchases.\n\nQuiltPaper also makes it easy to work with inspiration images because you can place an image ‘just so’ under a grid by adjusting the image to fit!\n\nOnce a setting is complete, the design can be brought into the Paint Tool (with the inspiration image!) for coloring with solids and textures. While there is an extensive color palette available, unlimited custom color palettes can be created by — \n• Taking colors from images or live camera\n• Setting RGB or HSB codes\n• Selecting colors on the color wheel\n\nNOTE — If you are looking for a quilt block library, you will not find one here. QuiltPaper app is for quilters who use a grid to plan and design a quilt. It is worth mentioning, however, that a few in-app purchase papers use a Pattern Planner tool that offers at least a minimum level of block planning. These papers are Pinwheel, Arc, and Log Cabin.\n\nEnjoy English Paper Piecing? \nMake your own EPP templates. QuiltPaper can create shapes at the exact size you need for your project. You can even place a circle at the center of each template to cut a hole for easier paper removal. Once the template page is set, it can be — \n•Printed to cut templates by hand\n•Exported as a PDF or SVG to laser and pattern cutting machines\n\nHST & HRT paper (InApp purchase) lets you make your own at the exact size you want — \n• HST. Set overall size and seam allowance for template.\n• HRT. Set overall size and seam allowance for template with trimmed corners for easier, accurate matching during assembly (no ‘dog ears’).\n\nPURCHASE INCLUDES 3 PAPERS:\nGRID — Classic grid graph paper taken up a notch! \nDOT— Choice of 5 dot styles and 2 dot patterns.\nDIAGONAL — On-point design graph paper.\n\n— FEATURES OF ALL PAPERS —\n√  Buy once — purchase works on all devices — iPhone, iPad, iPod.\n√  Metric (cm or mm) and Inch settings for grid and page size. \n√  Paint quilt layout with color and pattern. Make your own color palettes.\n√  Place an inspiration image under any grid, then adjust size and placement.\n√  Up to four line colors on a grid.\n√  Put multiple grids on a page to plan block designs, assembly, etc.\n√  Title grid with choice of font, size, bold or italic, and color.\n√  Print on standard sized page (such as 8.5x11 or A4) or set a custom size.\n√  Avoid the headache of scaling a design by setting the page at the quilt actual size by using ‘Custom’ page size setting.\n√  Library of Quick Pick templates offer inspiration  and a short cut to creating layouts.\n√  Print or share grids as a PDF, PNG or SVG to other apps for further editing — even as templates to laser or pattern cutting machines.\n√  Share painted grids as a PNG or PDF. \n√  Work up close using pinch-n-zoom gesture.\n√  Place a center-point on most papers. \n\nIN-APP PURCHASES unlock specialty papers: \nTriangle\nHST & HRT\nTumbler\nDiamond\nPolygon (especially helpful to make shapes for EPP)\nHexagon\nHoneycomb (Lucy Boston)\n8 point star (Lone Star)\n6 point star\nLog Cabin\nJewel\nJewel Ring\nKite\nBrick\nSquare\nCircle\nArc\nPinwheel\n\n• ‘All Papers Forever’ bundle.

As you listen your brainwaves fall into step with this inaudible beat, and after several minutes synchronize with the target frequency. \n\nBrain Wave Altered State uses the most advanced multi-stage binaural sequences available, combined with the flexibility to choose from a range of relaxing ambient backgrounds, other audio apps, or your own iTunes Music, allowing your mind you to relax and synchronize with your desired state.  It achieves this using our unique process called Progressive Brainwave Entrainment.\n\n*** Progressive Brainwave Entrainment ***\n\nProgressive Brainwave Entrainment algorithms use layers of frequencies and carrier signals assembled in precise sequences to create profoundly unique experiences.  Each program gently brings your brainwave frequencies to your desired state using a more natural frequency progression.\n\n*** Advanced Features ***\n\n - 20 Brainwave programs each specially designed for a different situation and desired mental state.\n\n - 17 ambient background sounds to choose from.\n\n - Independently adjustable ambient sound volume.\n\n - Visual timer countdown indicator.\n\n - Automatic storage of preferred brainwave program and ambient background.\n\n - Ability to set your own custom program duration.\n\n\n* Programs Included *\n\n - Chakra Meditation:  A series of balanced, meditative brainwave programs each taking you to a different, deeper meditative state, ending in the ultimate state of meditation and calm.\n\n - Euphoric Bliss:  The ultimate brainwave program designed to gently bring your mind through a series of uplifting states, culminating in a state of euphoria and bliss.

      "label": "VISUALIZE YOU\n\nLet’s face it. Losing weight is tough. Months of calorie counting, denial and exercise and no clear idea of what you’ll look like after all that hard work. Finally, after years of research with the Cleveland Clinic and the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center, comes the first scientifically accurate, photographic weight change app, Visualize You. Unlike conventional photo manipulations that stretch or pinch images, the Visualize You weight change viewer modifies the volume of your neck and face based upon clinically verified weight change dynamics. The resulting image of the new you is accurate, photorealistic and represents your specific target weight loss goal, whether modest or significant.  \n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nIn three easy steps, the Visualize You app transforms your image to show the dramatic effects of weight loss.  Alternately, you can set a heavier target weight to see the negative effects of an unhealthy diet and lifestyle.  To get started, simply upload your photo from your library or use your smart phone to take a photo of your current self. Information guides imbedded in the app will help you take the best resulting image. After entering your height, weight, and desired target weight, define and adjust your image using the intuitive touch screen controls.  Hit the ‘next’ button and, voilà, the new you will appear on your phone, providing inspiration and motivation to reach your target weight loss goal. You can even save and send the new you image to your support team of family and friends who will encourage you to achieve your desired weight goal.\n\nACHIEVING THE NEW YOU\n\nStaying on track with weight loss and achieving your ideal weight is not easy.  It involves creating an eating plan that you can live with rather than just another diet. Regular exercise and the consumption of healthy foods can lead to a host of benefits, including increased energy, happiness, health and even a long life.  Exercise and diet are pivotal in determining a person’s overall health, and making them both a part of your lifestyle can make a dramatic difference in how you look and feel. Visualize You provides a host of weight loss topics and guides to help you reach and maintain your new you weight goal including:\n\nArthritis\nBlood Pressure & Heart\nCholesterol\nDental Issues\nDiabetes\nDigestive Issues\nEating Issues\nEmotional Issues\nHealth Issues\nJoints & Mobility\nSleep\nSocial Issues/ Self Esteem\nWhat’s in it for YOU"

This App is intended to promote conscious awareness of face-touching, and detects if your Watch-wearing hand moves near your face. This functionality is available in hour-long training-periods in which the App buzzes and counts whenever a face-touch is detected.\n \nThis product is not a medical device nor does it claim to diagnose, measure, or treat any condition. It is simply designed to provide awareness and information about your habits for your own use. This app does not function all day long; the window is 1 hour unless reset. \n \nDetails\n- The app automatically vibrates and makes a sound when it detects that you have touched your face. In Settings, you can adjust the vibration strength and the volume separately (for example, if you want alerts to vibrate but not play sound).\n- The training session lasts 1 hour in the background. Navigate back to the App and touch the screen to extend the session. \n- If the App is not detecting enough of your face-touches, you can increase the sensitivity. \n- For clarity, the app does not notify you before your hand touches your face, but typically after. It is meant to increase awareness of face-touching.\n- Press the Play/Pause button to pause the App. The screen will turn yellow and the App will stop alerting you when you touch your face. Press play/pause again to resume detection; the screen will turn green."

All we need to do is to consistently tap into it by nourishing our thoughts with the characteristics we wish to become. If we know that we are beautiful, intelligent, healthy, or whatever quality we desire, that is what we shall manifest, so why not begin each day by affirming magnificence?\n\n“If our belief is limited, only a little can come to us, because that is as we believe.”\n~Ernest Holmes, The Science of Mind \n\nWith “CSL Daily Affirmations - 2022” you'll begin each day with a unique, powerful declaration of your truth that is sure to get your day moving in the right direction while providing a positive reference point when life’s complications pop up. \n\nCreated by the Centers for Spiritual Living (CSL) Member Council, “CSL Daily Affirmations - 2022” follow the global themes that serve as a guide for weekly Sunday talks at CSL centers worldwide. Those who are familiar with the talks know that these messages serve as a practical guide to living a full, rich life and that affirmations are a spiritual practice and an important tool to condition our minds into right thought. \n\nBeginning each Monday, “CSL Daily Affirmations - 2022” will deliver a new positive message daily to your device that will be anchored the following Sunday with a spiritually uplifting message by a CSL ordained minister, licensed spiritual practitioner or guest speaker at each of the centers worldwide. And whether you attend a service in person, virtually, or not at all, the impact of starting each day on an affirmative course can be profound.\n\nBased in Golden, Colorado, Centers for Spiritual Living™ is a global community comprised of more than 400 spiritual communities, teaching chapters, study groups and other ministries in 30 countries. These communities teach a New Thought philosophy that brings religion and science together and offers spiritual tools to transform personal lives.\nThis is done through the study and practice of Science of Mind® and Spirit, also known as Religious Science®, which holds that all life is sacred—that each human being is an expression of God. We believe in Cause and Effect and teach that “it is done unto you as you believe.” In essence, our thinking and expectations create our reality.\n\nOur teachings incorporate the ancient wisdom of spiritual traditions through the ages. People of all spiritual paths — Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, and others — are welcome in our communities. We help people experience a personal relationship with the creator; promote a community of tolerance, understanding and respect; provide classes, programs, prayer and meditation; and advocate a safe spiritual community of like-minded people interested in living a spiritual life.\n\nOur Global Vision: “A World That Works for Everyone”\n\nThe “CSL Daily Affirmations - 2022” App is the extension of a 2020 project of the CSL Member Council where affirmations were created for daily planner and for social media. The wide success of this project led the Council to create affirmations that are in alignment with the Centers for Spiritual Living monthly global themes and weekly talks that are delivered daily to your mobile device. Affirmations may be downloaded, shared and archived. No advertising shall be permitted on the “CSL Daily Affirmations - 2022” app nor will personal information of any user be sold or given away. This subscription is for one year.\n\nIf you feel our app helps you in your journey, take a moment to leave a great rating and review. We appreciate any support you can give us. If you have feedback on the app or suggestions for new features, contact us via email."

Transforma tu dispositivo en un acompañante ideal a la hora de elegir un vino en un restaurante, para un momento especial, visitar alguna de las bodegas reseñadas, conocer la mejor selección de enotecas, fiestas del vino, etc.\nUno de los factores esenciales para la elaboración anual de la Guía de Vinos Gourmets lo constituye su Comité de Cata, compuesto por 19 profesionales en activo (sumilleres, enólogos, periodistas especializados…). En esta edición de 2023 han analizado y evaluado de forma objetiva e independiente 4.160 vinos, mediante el sistema de cata a ciegas, por el cual se desconoce la marca del vino catado.\n\nGracias a esta app, podrás conocer la información publicada en esta Guía independiente editada por el Grupo Gourmets. Fundada en 1976, es la primera empresa editora de España especializada en gastronomía, vinos y viajes. Sus cabeceras son la revista Club de Gourmets (desde 1976) y la Guía de Vinos Gourmets (38 ediciones-decana del sector). En noviembre de 1986 el Grupo Gourmets crea el Club de Vinos Gourmets y un año más tarde convoca, organiza y desarrolla el Salón de Gourmets, Feria Internacional de Alimentación y Bebidas de Calidad.\n\nEn esta versión 2023 tendrás acceso a toda la información técnica de los 4.427 vinos españoles reseñados, así como a una detallada descripción de cata de 2.621 vinos de nuestro país que han alcanzado una puntuación mínima de 80/100 puntos.\n\nLa 38 en números \nLa GVG no pretende ser un censo de bodegas españolas y por tanto nos vemos limitados a una selección, de cierto número de vinos al año, marcada por nuestra metodología de cata -catar a ciegas no más de 20 vinos por sesión-. Las catas a ciegas con múltiples referencias/muestras no forman parte de nuestro criterio editorial. \nLos datos de esta edición son: \n\n• 1.156 bodegas referenciadas \n• 4.427 vinos reseñados \n• 112 sesiones de cata a ciegas \n• 4.160 vinos catados a ciegas (incluyendo aquellos que han necesitado una recata) \n• 2.621 vinos catados a ciegas, puntuados y comentados (con calificación mínima de 80/100 puntos) \n• 1.777 vinos del Cuadro de Honor (con calificación mínima de 90/100 puntos) \n• 209 tiendas especializadas \n• 160 fiestas del vino"

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

I started using this app and she was accident free the first day. It's very accurate nearly to the minute she has to go potty. I emailed the info to the puppy class trainer. It's very easy to use.\n\nFantastic App!  - byHot K - May 6, 2014\nI LOVE this app. I really needed something to help me make heads or tails out of mine & my new puppies day so we could have a smooth, fun house training process. Well, this app provides that! It certainly delivers what it promises & more! The app is easy to use & fun. It sorts out all the patterns of our new Sproodle & I feel less stressed. Def give this app a try if you haven't house trained a dog before, or maybe even if you have :)\n\nGreat tool!  - bymanwdaplan - Apr 24, 2014\nAmazingly accurate at predicting my dogs needs. Also, a very simple and clean (and cute) interface that makes the training process much less frustrating.\nLove this app! \n\nbyJonasfann1 - Apr 20, 2015 - Really very cool for any owner of a new puppy! LOVE using this app!!"

      "label": "This app teaches you to 'receive' Morse code.\n\nIt starts with two letters and automatically adds more when it understands that you are ready.\n\nThis is the easiest and most efficient way to learn Morse code as the app focuses on the practice you need next, instead of wasting your time with stuff you already know or confusing you with stuff that you still don’t.\n\nThe original idea comes from Ward K9OX (http://c2.com/morse/).\n\nBy default the app uses the 'Koch' method letter sequence and starts with the first two letters: K and M. But you can use any of the methods available and find the one that suits more your likings. There's also a training program for the top 40 words used during a CW QSO.\n\nAround each letter you have a circle chart showing how high is your error score. It starts from 100% (full circle) and lowers as you start guessing letters right and increases when you are wrong or you take too much time to recognise them.\n\nTo start the training, simply press the PLAY button on the top right of the display.\n\nAt this point the app will start playing tones. Press the one that you think corresponds to the tone. If you are wrong, the app will let you know by playing an 'error' sound. If you are right, the app will continue by picking up another letter or word. Once you'll become good enough with the active letters, the app will enable a new one following the method selected.\n\nYou can decide to put the training lesson on hold by pressing the PAUSE button. Or stop it by pressing the STOP button. If you want to have an automatic stop after a certain amount of minutes, you can set the SESSION TIME in the settings.\n\nWhile not training, you can tap on any key or word and listen to its tone to start to get used to it even outside of the training session.\n\nYou can access the SETTINGS by tapping the 'hamburger icon' on the top left.\n\nYou can look at your top 10 scores by tapping BEST SCORES in the left menu.\n\nImportant: you can use the app in both landscape and portrait mode!\n\nEnjoy learning Morse code!"

Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too. We want to cover things like smoothness, nasality, vocal fry, even creating a rating of how attractive your voice currently is, based on the latest research.

      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

The writing is clean and witty. The drinks? Delicious. \n\n5 Star - Fantastic!! \n(UK iTunes review)\nI didn't think that this application would be up to the same standard set by the book (which is THE definitive cocktail bible), but I couldn't have been more wrong! It's every bit as informative as the book, and the fact that it's interactive - it lists the cocktails that you can make from the drinks in your cabinet - makes it even easier to use. And at the price of half a pint of beer, it's astonishingly under-priced for such a brilliant application.\n\n5 Star - Marvelous \n(UK iTunes review)\nLooks as good as the books, fits in the pocket......."

      "label": "Family tree research is becoming an ever more popular past time.  Normally all of your genealogy information is locked away on your computer at home which isn't much use when you are out and about researching local records, or visiting locations such as graveyards, ancestral homes, or family reunions.\n\nThis is where GedView comes in.  Carry around your entire family tree on your iPhone, iPod, or iPad and have all the data about your ancestors and even current descendants at your fingertips.\n\nYou can quickly check up on family relationships, dates / locations of events, and record new information.  Despite the name GedView is not just a viewing tool.  This includes taking photos, or video anywhere and anytime you like without needing to worry about a potentially costly internet connection.   If using an iPhone, or a cellular enabled iPad you can even record your current location to add to any event.\n\nIf your tree contains lots of images you can even use GedView as a slideshow, showing all the pictures related to a given event, person, source, family.  You can also play back any home movies you have in your tree.  Media support is not limited to photos/video.  Support is also included for any other file type your iPhone, iPod, or iPad is capable of opening.  This may be PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, mp3 files.  If you have an app installed that supports a specific document type and have a document of that type in your tree you will be able to view it via GedView.\n\nDo you have some separate branches in your tree that you haven't connected yet?  GedView allows you to store multiple trees so you can easily switch to view distinct branches.\n\nUnlike other apps no specific computer application is required, nor is a subscription to any website.  Instead standard GEDCOM files can be imported,  These can be encoded as ASCII, ANSI, ANSEL, UTF-8, or UTF-16 and can be added to GedView via WiFi, downloading from a website, via iTunes, or even opened from other apps such as Mail, Safari, Dropbox etc.\n\nWhile GedView is targeted towards GEDCOM 5.5.1 it will read in any version, and will also support many custom extensions used by other genealogy applications, and because GEDCOM hasn't been added as an after thought imports are fast and efficient.\n\nYou can even export GEDCOM files for sharing with family members or other researchers, or to transfer new information to your main computer.\n\nA sample family tree containing the British monarchy is included.\n\nIf you have any problems, or suggestions please get in touch via the support email address."

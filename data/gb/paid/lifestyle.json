When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

If you move the device after it has been calibrated you will need to recalibrate, simply click the \"Back\" button, move the device to a new area, then click \"Calibrate\" again.\n\nThere are 12 music box songs that his app randomly chooses from when it calibrates.\n\nThe sensors used are:\n\nMagnetometer - This senses Magnetic and Electromagnet fields around the device\nAccelerometer - This senses any device movement and the slightest vibrations around the device\nBarometer - Detects any change in the Ambient Air Pressure around the device\nCompass - Detects the slightest change in magnetic interference to Magnetic North\nGyroScope - Detects the slightest movement of the device\nOrientation - Detects the slightest movement to the position of the device\n\nIf your device is missing any sensors, the app will still work perfectly well without them.\n\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk, I cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

As new puppy owners you can start this training from 8 weeks of age.  As a breeder you can start this from 3 weeks of age. \n\n After teaching puppy class for several years I needed a way to assist clients to get their puppies comfortable around environmental noise.

We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate.

This app will help you understand why other people don't always think or act the way you believe they should, or in the same way as you. \n\nNeurodiversity has been defined by Oxford Learning Dictionaries as \"The range of differences in individual brain function and behavioural traits, regarded as part of normal variation in the human population\".  These are less visible than other diversity measures, but just as vital: hidden traits/aspects of cognitive neurodiversity and personality/persona include (i) how our brains prefer to perceive information (ii) how we prefer to make decisions, (iii) introversion and extroversion. \n\nNeuroscience is a relatively new and developing science.\n\nNo advertising, just the app. Rich in detail and with full explanations of the science behind it."

It is Vault Code protected at all times, so whether it is on your nightstand or at the coffee shop, NO ONE can access your inventory but you. \n\nWe decided (through much discussion) to minimize all instructions on HOW to do a 4th Step. As alcoholics, we had no shortage of opinions on what each of us believed were the best instructions. We decided to use the original text from the Big Book for the actual questions for you to answer, instead of rewording them as we saw some of the 4th Step \"guides\" do. \n\nYour sponsor may want you to write out (with pen and paper) your 4th step. If that is the case, you may still utilize the app to collect your inventory information, then after printing it out, copy it over by hand.  \n\nThis app is not AA reviewed or approved. AA does not endorse or approve anything or anyone. All quotes are from the 1st edition of the Big Book.  This app was created by members for members. Thanks to their generous support this app is FREE to anyone world-wide. Remember: Our primary purpose is to stay sober, and help another alcoholic.\n\nThanks,\n\nTwelve Step Apps\nwww.12StepApps.org"

      "label": "7 Advanced Binaural Dream Induction Programs in One App!  Dream Inducer combines soothing ambient sounds with powerful binaural sequences to synchronize your brainwaves with frequencies associated with 7 different levels of dreaming. * Universal iOS App for iPhone/Pad * Headphones or Earbuds must be worn for binaural tones to be effective.\n\n* Each program includes a sleep induction phase and then introduces progressively higher frequency Alpha, Beta, and Theta dream sequences to stimulate increasingly vivid dreams.\n\n* To combine Brainwaves and Ambience with Audio from Another App use the 'Ambience + Other App' background mode.\n\n* To use just Brainwaves and Audio from Another App use the \"Other App\" option for the Background Mode.\n\n** How Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Works **\nThrough the process of brainwave entrainment human brainwave frequencies can be synchronized with a  frequency associated with a target mental state.  These Brainwave frequencies are too low for the human ear to hear, however, these low-frequencies can be perceived by the human brain if two different audible frequencies are played separately into each ear with headphones or earbuds.  For example, the human ear can't directly perceive the 2 Hz Delta-wave frequency associated with deep sleep, but if you wear headphones with one side playing a 135 Hz tone and the other playing a 137 Hz tone your brain will perceive the 2 Hz difference between those frequencies as a periodic beat.  As you listen, your brainwaves will begin to match that frequency, inducing the associated mental state.\n\nDream Inducer improves upon basic binaural techniques by layering multiple signals and then assembling these into sequences of programs that combine to create extremely unique experiences."

      "label": "Looking for help with calculations for your swimming pool or hot tub chemistry maintenance? The Pool Calculator does all the math for you, making chemical testing and treating your pool or hot tub a breeze.\n\nPool Calculator is easy to use, and tells you exactly how much of each chemical to add to keep your water in balance and crystal clear. No more puzzling over complicated charts and formulas.\n\nBring your iPhone or iPad out to the pool and have all the chemical information and calculations you need right at your fingertips.\n\nPool Calculator works offline and online, so if you have poor internet reception by your pool, you’re still able to get test results.\n\nPool Calculator provides a complete tool kit to make pool care easy.  You get:\n•\tChemical Calculator\n•\tPool Volume Calculator\n•\tChemical Effects (What-if) Calculator\n\n\nCHEMICAL CALCULATORS\nYou can use whichever test strip or test kit you prefer for testing your pool or hot tub.  Pool Calculator provides calculations for:\n- Chlorine (FCl)\n- Raising pH\n- Lowering pH\n- Total alkalinity (TA)\n- Calcium hardness (CH)\n- Stabilizer (CYA or cyanuric acid)\n- Salt\n- Borate (Borax)\n- Calcium saturation index (CSI, similar to LSI)\n\nRECOMMENDED CHEMICAL RANGES- USE OURS OR DECIDE YOUR OWN\nWith Pool Calculator, the recommended ranges for your chemicals are based upon whether you have a pool or hot tub, and the surface material (plaster, vinyl or fiberglass) of your pool or hot tub.  You can choose from several pre-defined ranges or customize based on your or your pool pro’s preferences.\n\nPOOL VOLUME CALCULATOR\nTo keep your swimming pool or hot tub at its best, it’s important that you accurately calculate your water volume. All of the chemical balancing recommendations you receive from the Pool Calculator are based on it. You can calculate the volume of your pool in metric units (liters) or in imperial units (gallons).   The Pool Volume Calculator can be used for:\n•\tRectangular Pools and Hot Tubs\n•\tOval Pools and Hot Tubs\n•\tRound Pools and Hot Tubs\n\nCHEMICAL EFFECTS CALCULATOR\n“What if” analysis for adding chemicals to your pool or hot tub!  Ever want to know the impact of adding a given amount of Chemical has on your swimming pool or hot tub chemistry? \n\nThe Chemical Effects Calculator calculates the impact adding a specific amount of chemical has on your pool chemistry.  It does this not only for the primary purpose of the chemical, but also on the other important measurements for your pool.  For example, adding Trichlor not only raises your Free Chlorine, it also increases your Cyanuric Acid, lowers your pH and increases your Salt.  Adding Cal Hypo raises Free Chlorine, and also raises Calcium Hardness (CH)  and Salt.\n\nWith the Chemical Effects Calculator, you can measure the effects on pool chemistry of adding a given dose of:\n•\tBleach\n•\tTrichlor\n•\tDichlor\n•\tCal-hypo\n•\tLithium Hypochlorite\n•\tChlorine gas\n•\tMuriatic Acid\n•\tDry Acid\n•\tWashing soda\n•\tSoda Ash\n•\tBorax\n•\tSodium Tetraborate Pentahydrate\n•\tBoric Acid\n•\tCaustic Acid (lye)\n•\tBaking Soda\n•\tCalcium Chloride\n•\tCalcium Chloride dihydrate\n•\tStabilizer\n•\tLiquid Stabilizer\n•\tSalt\n  \nPoolCalculator can be used for in ground or above ground pools, spas and hot tubs, chlorine or salt pools, and a broad range of surfaces."

While realization ultimately cannot be surrounded or captured with words, along the way they have power. It is possible to catalyze the transformation of ordinary understanding into Diamond Mind with them. \n\nThe text is configured as an oracular text, just like the I Ching, to facilitate concentration upon a particular teaching with respect to a specific question. It centers primarily around wei wu wei, the ancient Taoist notion that translates roughly to “doing not-doing”. By whatever name or not-name, this practice is the core teaching of every enlightenment tradition in the world. \n\nThis free app includes a consulting tool, a journaling tool, and the complete odd-numbered passages.  Full book content is available through an In-App Purchase.\n\nThe teachings of the Wei wu Wei Ching are sourced in Tao, Ch’an, Zen, Sufism, Native American spirituality, Tibetan Buddhism, Advaita, yoga, and other traditions less easily named. Whichever the source, they transmit the heart and soul of enlightened living."

With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

      "label": "Transform your life, repair DNA and create miracles in your life with this amazing meditation recording.\n\nThis is the third in a series of six meditation recordings by Glenn Harrold and Ali Calderwood, which are based upon the ancient Solfeggio musical scale. Each note in this scale has specific healing properties and this recording uses the third note, which resonates to a frequency of 528 Hz and is associated with the colour gold and the element of fire. \n\nThis frequency is described as the love frequency as it has the potential to bring about transformation and create miracles as well as repairing broken DNA. It can also help to overcome problems like fatigue, anxiety, control issues and negative thought patterns, all of which exist within the same vibrational energy.\n\nInterestingly, 528 Hz is the exact frequency used by genetic biochemists to repair broken DNA so our ancestors who used this scale for healing and transformation knew the power these frequencies held.\n\nGlenn Harrold's skilled vocal delivery and guided meditation combined with Ali Calderwood's deep and moving soundscapes tuned to 528 Hz combine to create an amazingly powerful meditation recording. By combining these sounds with a guided meditation, you also have the potential to release deep-rooted blockages. These compositions also contain an array of sacred instruments and sounds such as crystal bowls and didgeridoo and sacred chants, which work to further enhance the effects of the Solfeggio tones.\n\nThis App contains two audio tracks, the first you can use in the daytime as it will guide you back to full waking consciousness at the end. The second track will guide you into a deep sleep state at the end, which makes it ideal for using before you go to sleep at night. When you are instructed to repeat affirmations, connect with positive feelings (e.g. happiness, joy, love), this will help you absorb the suggestions on a deeper level. You don’t have to repeat the affirmations out loud but do make a strong connection with them.\n\nThis App includes:\n528 Hz Solfeggio Sonic Meditation Audio Track 1 – 37:11 (awake version)\n528 Hz Solfeggio Sonic Meditation Audio Track 2 – 42:42 (sleep version)\nMI 528 Hz Solfeggio Music Only Audio Track – 10:43\n\nSolfeggio Chart\nGlenn Harrold's Self-Hypnosis e-Book.\nAbout the Ancient Solfeggio Scale and Healing Sounds e-Book\nHow To Use This App e-Book\nAbout The Authors e-Book"

      "label": "Simply the best. Whether you're new to the I Ching or have used the book as an oracle, an aid to creativity, or a mirror of your subconscious, you'll love the clarity of writing, the intuition in the design, and the simplicity of use of this digital I Ching or Yi Jing. The modern, no-nonsense interface delivers new users straight to the basics: you ask a question, the I-Ching answers. For old souls who know the book well this app holds a wealth of features for deeper research. There's a journal where you can save and search your questions and readings, a notes area where you can record any length of text as context, a lookup library organized by number and trigram.  You can recreate any I Ching reading using decimal notation.  Original Chinese text included in an alternative selectable library at no additional charge. There are no ads, no subscriptions, no in-app purchases.   \n\nThe I Ching software engine emulates precisely the ancient yarrow stalk method, which was slightly more likely to cast yang than yin. A changing yin line is very rare using stalks,  but of equal probability to changing yang using coins. The ancient divination method uses stalks rather than coins. \n\nIf you prefer to count your own stalks or cast your own coins there's a manual hexagram builder to make your task easier. \n\nThe wisdom and philosophy of the ancient Chinese texts blend seamlessly with commentaries  that gently mix a dash of modern poetry, a pinch of humor, and cultural grace notes from the worlds of art, music, divination, and literature to bring you what many daily users have called the very best I-Ching app available. \n---------\nAmong my favourite reviews: \n\n\"Of all the versions I've used, your renderings of the Book of Changes are my heart-felt favorites. They have inspired me, made me laugh and cry and everything in between.\"\n\n“Pretty profound! This Iching app gave me spot-on advice. I've never paid for an app before, but I had a strong urge to get this one. I'm impressed! Not to sound all new-age but I totally laughed out loud at the reading it gave me, it was like it was sitting here looking over my shoulder and telling me exactly what I needed to know about my grumpy husband. P.S. Grumpy husband called and apologized right when I finished reading my reading.\"\n\n\"Carl Jung would have been happy to have this Yi Jing on his phone - great to use, unfussy, untechy, respectful of the original. The journal feature is great for storing readings and referring back. Well done!\"\n---------\nAll of us sometimes need a sympathetic ear and wise guidance, whether it's in matters of romance or finance: the I-Ching can become a companion along life’s journey like no other. It's a book that helps you explore questions and, if you're lucky, find answers: Whether you believe it's because the book is an oracle or the answers are simply unearthed from your subconscious -- the book's true magic lies in its ability to be a helpful guide (sometimes astoundingly so) to all these different forms of curiosity.   \n\nFollowing the tradition of Baynes and countless interpreters of the original texts, I've written commentaries which borrow words and inspiration from a multitude of sources; Bob Dylan, Lao Tzu, Doctor Who, the Tarot, T.S. Eliot, King Kong, John Lennon, the Grateful Dead and Martin Luther King all make cameo appearances. The language, unlike so many translations, makes every attempt to be gender-neutral.\n\nI wanted the sparest interface possible. No fake parchment backgrounds, no gimmicky images of bamboo or cartoon sages with oracles and winning lottery numbers. I tried not to imitate materials in the real world, but to let this app be its own thing, at home in its digital divination space. \n\nI strived to create a quiet, reflective, slowed down experience in an environment that normally shouts.\n\nI hope you enjoy using this I-Ching app as much as I enjoy crafting it, improving it, and hearing from people who have found it helpful in their lives."

This app can assist you in your journey towards courage, but keep in mind that it is not a replacement for professional help. It can be helpful for people coming out of depression, dealing with anxiety or just shy folks. The app allows you to:\n- create a list with everyday tasks you avoid doing because of fear. You can rate the anxiety they are causing you and tackle them one by one.\n- Challenge yourself to complete a certain number of tasks for a period of time. The app uses positive reinforcement to motivate you.\n- Clarify your goals and values in the main domains of life. Avoidance prevents you from living the life you deserve to live.\n- Use intermittent reinforcement to pick a random task to tackle"

Purchasing the app is itself a tax deductible donation, and we greatly appreciate your support in keeping Falling Fruit online!\n\nOur global map of edible plants is not the first of its kind, but it aspires to be the world's most comprehensive. While our users contribute locations of their own, we comb the internet for pre-existing knowledge, seeking to unite the efforts of foragers, foresters, and freegans everywhere. Imported datasets range from small neighborhood foraging maps to vast professionally-compiled tree inventories. So far, this amounts to over 1,200 different edible types (most, but not all, plant species) distributed over nearly one million locations. Beyond the cultivated and commonplace to long-forgotten native plants and the exotic flavors of foreign plants, foraging in your neighborhood is a journey through time and across cultures.\n\nFalling Fruit is not associated with Fallen Fruit.

Now featuring pro quality reverb, the famous \"Hindi\" based bank D, upgraded audio engine now recording mono wav 44.1 files, a whole new mode, reversed playback and more.\n\nThe learning curve for 3.0 is pretty steep for the new user.\nYou can also get help from me and over 1,000 other users worldwide at: www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers\n\nDEMO VIDEO IS IN PRODUCTION.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THIS SOFTWARE IS CPU INTENSIVE AND RUNS BEST ON NEWER DEVICES. \n\nECHOVOX System all-in-one Echo based Real Time EVP recording system from the creator of SpiritVox.\n\nEchoVox is a real-time amplified recording system used to create a bed of random chaotic noise using random phonetics, microphone input and a natural loop recording echo. Delay time can be set from anywhere to 0-10 seconds. This means what you are hearing is the actual audio being recorded to disk in real-time, as it happens.\n\nEcho has been shown to contribute to EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon)\n\nNote: The Echo is not a digital effect added to the sound. It is a loop of the actual recording. An external/BlueTooth speaker is recommended for the best results, also the louder the better.\n\nFEATURES:\nECHO WITHOUT RECORDING\n6 CHANNELS OF RANDOM PHONETIC AUDIO\n4 SOUND BANKS.\nSTUDIO QUALITY REVERB\n44.1 WAV REAL-TIME AUDIO RECORDING\nNEW \"BURST\" MODE*\nNEW AUTO BLEND/AUTO SHUFFLE\nMULTIPLE DELAY SETTINGS\nMIC GAIN INPUT CONTROL\nPLAY,FF,REW,SLOW,SPEED UP,REVERSE AUDIO FILES WITHIN APP FOR REVIEW\nUPLOAD TO SOUNDCLOUD\nFILE BROWSER\nNAME SESSION AT START\nCUSTOM REVERB PRESETS (.ievrp) CAN BE SAVED AND TRADED.\n\n*Random burst of random sounds from random banks for a random amount of time\n\n\nCONTROLS:\nEach channel has independent playback speed control + on/off.\n\nMic gain controls microphone input volume\n\n\"Auto Blend\" \"Shuffle\" blends across the 6 random audio channels\n\nEcho starts recording to disk.\n\nTHEORY: This is the result of years of experiments in the field, it is still a work in progress. The echo is actually a chaotic loop of the chopped up vocal samples and environmental sounds. A virtual soup of sound and frequencies impossible to predict.\n\nThis system has been used and tested WORLDWIDE. On live television in India and South America. Featured on televisions \"Ghost Trail\" and \"Seekers\" and more. EchoVox is simply the #1 most trusted and widely used app by both pro's and \"armchair\" paranormal investigators.\n\nEchovox is used by Barry Fitzgerald of TV's Ghost Hunters International and Bill Murphy of TV's Fact or Faked Paranormal files, Chris Flemming of Psychic Kids and Robb Demarest of Ghost Hunters International and other leaders in the paranormal field.\n\nEchoVox is NOT just an app, it is not a toy. \n\nIt is for use by serious investigators and is not for the casual user.\n\nThe best way to learn more about EchoVox:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/bigbeardaudio\n\nJOIN THE FB GROUP: www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers\n\nI support my work 100% and want to help you learn to use this correctly and help with any issues.

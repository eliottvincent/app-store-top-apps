When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "After many years of researching sensor data for lots of different types of paranormal apps, I have concluded that the best way for Spirits to manipulate a device (or the device sensors) is by keeping it simple and universal across the whole world.\n\nThe Spirit Music Box works similar to the world famous Para4ce device, but this uses a lot more sensors and is more complex!\n\nIf any of the sensors pick up a change then the Music Box will start playing an old eerie music box song.\n\nSimply place the device in any area, click the \"Calibrate\" button then move away from the device. If you move the device after it has been calibrated you will need to recalibrate, simply click the \"Back\" button, move the device to a new area, then click \"Calibrate\" again.\n\nThere are 12 music box songs that his app randomly chooses from when it calibrates.\n\nThe sensors used are:\n\nMagnetometer - This senses Magnetic and Electromagnet fields around the device\nAccelerometer - This senses any device movement and the slightest vibrations around the device\nBarometer - Detects any change in the Ambient Air Pressure around the device\nCompass - Detects the slightest change in magnetic interference to Magnetic North\nGyroScope - Detects the slightest movement of the device\nOrientation - Detects the slightest movement to the position of the device\n\nIf your device is missing any sensors, the app will still work perfectly well without them.\n\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk, I cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

      "label": "Whether you are a professional Paranormal Investigator, a hobbyist or just want to have some fun, this app works like a \"Spirit Box\" reading data from your sensors and turning it into spoken words.\n\nWith a database of over a thousand commonly used words, Ghostalker will read changes in all of the sensors it can find in your device. This includes sensors for the tiniest amount of vibration, rotation, GPS, gyroscope, light, magnetic fields, proximity etc. and convert them to words which it will display and speak. This app uses the actual raw data from the sensors to determine what to say, rather than picking words at random like some other apps.\n\nLOGGING: This is the full version of the app so it logs the words spoken for you to view, save, email, delete etc. at a later time. There is also a built-in log viewer. The date and time is logged, along with the combined change in sensor readings (so you can see how big a change was picked up) and the word. The log files are in CSV format so you can import them into your favourite spreadsheet (e.g. MS Excel or Google Sheets).\n\nDICTIONARY: You can also manage your own custom dictionary of words so you can make your own special list of replies. You can flick between the in-built dictionary, your own custom dictionary or both combined (from v0.5) at any time.\n\nThis app is not designed to form complete sentences so it is up to you to interpret what it says in your own way. Top end phones and tablets tend to have more sensors than low end ones but the app is designed to work with whatever it can find. The sensitivity of sensors will also vary between devices.\n\nTIP 1: Using the custom dictionary you can have it reply with special limited words, for example 'yes', 'no' and 'maybe' when you ask it questions. Or add a series of digits and get it to pick your lottery numbers. Or add the letters of the alphabet so it can work like a Ouija board. \n\nTIP 2: Paranormal investigators believe that leaving such devices running for as long as possible will allow \"spirits\" to learn what energy is required to trigger certain words.\n\nTIP 3: If it starts to trigger words constantly you may be getting interference from something close by. Try moving the device somewhere else or tap the 'Calibrate' button to get it to tune out background variance (although you will lose some sensitivity).\n\nTIP 4: NEW - Keep lists of custom words in text files. Each word should be on its own line or separated by a space. Select all of the words and copy them to the clipboard. You can then import them into Ghostalker by pasting them from the clipboard. You can also copy word lists from the web, an email, or anywhere you can copy text.\n\nIf the app does not do what you were expecting, or there is an issue with it running on your device, please contact us for help.\n\nThere are no adverts in this software. If you would like to try the free version first (without the logging or custom dictionary functionality), it is listed under \"Ghostalker Lite\"."

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

Need to repeat the same count a number of times? This app let's you do exactly that!\nWorking on multiple projects simultaneously? No problem, just create multiple projects, and give each of them their own name. \nPrefer to work in silence? Use the option to turn of the tap-sound, easy! \nDon't like the color theme of the app? Change it, there are many different options to choose from, and if you become a supporter of the app, the icon will also take on the color you select!\nOh, and don't worry about your screen turning off, as it will stay on while you are using the app, without draining your battery!\nUse the widget on the today view for maximum convenience!\nIf you have suggestions or complaints, use the email button top-right in the app to contact me directly.\n\n____________________\nWhat others said:\n\"If you need a simple counter, this is the app for you. It’s simple and easy to use. I’ve tried others but keep coming back to this one.\" - Lunanator\n\n\"It’s so simple but perfect. I can keep all my project counts in one place!\" - Anna706\n\n\"I do one project at a time that would require a counter. This is the first I’ve seen that is really easy! I love it!\" - nurse195829\n\n\"I am a totally blind knitter and use voiceover to read my iPhone screen. I have long wanted a row counter that was accessible to me. I found it! Works perfectly, and the sounds confirm that I have added or subtracted a row. The only thing that voiceover users want to know is that you need to double tap the pencil icon in order to make the project name text field active. This app is moving to the front page of my home screen! Thank you! Simplicity often means accessibility to me. Awesome!\" - ThaiFoodLady\n\n\"Its simplicity is great\" - hsbz. hsn \n\n\"i got it because i always forget to keep track of my stitches... it was so easy to use, i didn’t like the noise it made when you clicked it but i just turned it off. i also love how your able to choose what color you want!\" - milembh\n\n\"After trying several counter apps, this is by far by favorite.\" - H408\n\n\"I was looking for a counter app. Nothing fancy as I didn’t was one that took up a lot of memory on my device. Thus app is PERFECT. It’s super easy to use and a bit customizable too. If you are looking for a basic counter app, look no further. Thus app will meet your needs!\" - JB45840"

Our algorithm analyses your voice and compares it with data from over 150 celebrities to let you understand your voice and learn how to improve it.\n\nThe Standard version of the app gives you a full analysis of your voice in terms of depth and variety and calculates a set of celebrity matches to give you a grounding of what your results mean.\n\nThe Pro version helps you improve your voice. Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too. We want to cover things like smoothness, nasality, vocal fry, even creating a rating of how attractive your voice currently is, based on the latest research. If you want to get the most out of your vocal chords, this is the app for you."

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "Happy Hints is an amazing new app that is destined to change the way we all think about how we live our everyday lives.   \n\nHappy Hints has been designed around an eternal calendar.  Every day for the rest of your life you will receive a positive message, beautifully presented.  Each message has an expanded summary of that day’s affirmation.  The message will be sent to your Apple device 3 times during the course of the day - morning, afternoon and evening.   This will provide you with the opportunity to both absorb and more importantly apply the daily message.  \n\nHappy Hints has been created for anyone looking to cultivate a happier frame of mind amidst the challenges of modern life.  Sadly, we are all moving too quickly and barely have the time to process what we are thinking and feeling.  This leaves most of us with a happiness deficit.  So whether you are a busy executive burdened by the demands of meetings and deadlines, a mother managing a home and looking after your children or you are just trying to find ways of managing the stress of life in the 21st century then Happy Hints is definitely for you!\n\nThe Happy Hints app also includes literally hundreds of audio-visual and written resources covering topics ranging from: how to manage anxiety, anger, depression and stress through to building self-confidence, developing a positive mental attitude and mindfulness tips.  \n\nThe beauty of this application is that it is simple to use and provides you with an encyclopedic resource at your fingertips.... which will serve up countless insights and invaluable inspirations when you most need them.  All the information is presented in an easily digestible format and you’ll soon find that Happy Hints will become an indispensable friend!  \n \nWe all have one thing in common.... our need to be happy.  Happiness is a virtue, but it’s really important to understand that it is also a skill.  A skill is something you can learn and develop and so happiness is something you can practise and the more you practise it the happier you will become.  \n \nWhy not let Happy Hints help you to do just that!"

Notifications will remind you when it is time to put out each type. Use the Apple Watch App or Widgets to quickly see your next collection.\n\nUse Siri shortcuts to ask when the next collection dates are for all bin schedules, which bin schedules are due on the next collection date, or when the next collection date is for an individual schedule. Manage shortcuts in Bin Day Alert's settings screen, the Shortcuts app, or in the Siri & Search section of Apple's Settings app.\n\nThe app supports a wide range of collection schedules, making it suitable for use at home or business premises: a specific day each week; multiple days each week; a specific day every 2, 3, 4 or 5 weeks; or a specific day on one or more weeks of the month.\n\nEach schedule can have up to two alerts. Each alert can either be for the day before or the day of the bin collection. Snooze an alert notification by 15 minutes if you're busy right now, or by 1 day/week if a public holiday has temporarily changed the bin schedule.\n\nGoing on vacation? There's a single setting to quickly disable all alerts.\n\nBack up your bin schedules to iCloud Drive, Dropbox etc. for safekeeping. Easily share your bin schedules with neighbors so they don't have to configure the app themselves."

Whether they're old favourites or just this year's experiment, keep track of everything you sow, plant, pick and harvest. Build your knowledge and look back at everything you accomplish.\n\nEvery time you spot something interesting, take a note. Seeing slug damage? You'll want to remember when they first appeared. Dahlia bulbs spent half of April under water? You'll know why they didn't look so great come July.\n\nLook back at last year to see what worked well and what needs adjustment.

Add to that an estimate of how much you smoke daily. \n\nThe app will calculate how much you have *not* smoked since you quit, showing you the amazing amount of money you've been saving since and the disgustingly large amount of unhealthy cigarettes you've not been smoking since as a motivation to continue.\n\nThe Apple Watch complications and the iPhone widgets help you with a quick glance to get reminded to how well you're doing, by showing you your progress at a glance.\n\nAnd if you ever need a quick help to fight an upcoming urge, use the complication or the widget showing you interesting \"fun facts\" that you can text your friends about to forget about the urge within minutes.\n\nYou'll also learn a few really silly fun facts along the way :)"

      "label": "This Spiritual Healing Meditation by Glenn Harrold will help you to heal energetic imprints and clear karma and energy blocks. Glenn is one of the world's most successful hypnotherapists and this recording was inspired by the intense ceremony work he undertook over a four month period at a Shamanic healing retreat in Panama. It is also influenced by the plant medicines of South America.\n\nEach and every one of us has an invisible energy field that surrounds us and which is alive with information. Trained visionaries, psychics and Shaman can see this subtle energy field which holds lots of information about you, both from this lifetime and your past lifetimes.\n\nWithin this energetic field there can be blockages and imprints that hold you back and prevent you from reaching your potential. Repetitive behavioural patterns that you find it hard to shake are often caused by karmic blocks in your energy fields. By absorbing the hypnotic suggestions on this recording you will be able to heal your energetic body of imprints from the past, raise your consciousness and clear karmic patterns that have been with you for lifetimes.\n\nWhen you heal yourself spiritually it will naturally follow that you will heal yourself physically and emotionally. Glenn recommends that you continue to use this recording as often as you can as the healing process can have many layers and life will continue to throw up challenges and issues for you to deal with. However, as you progress and more things clear in your energy fields, you will feel much lighter, and you will begin to regain your true nature and the essence of who you are.\n\nThis Shamanic influenced Spiritual Healing Meditation can help you heal your mind, body and spirit of energetic blocks and raise your vibration and consciousness. When you do this you become lighter and clearer and you step into your authentic self. Namaste.\n\nIncludes:\n• Spiritual Healing Meditation (awake) 38:48 mins\n• Spiritual Healing Meditation (sleep) 41:31 mins\n\neBooks\n• About The Author\n• How To Use This App\n• Guide to Self-Hypnosis"

With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

      "label": "Want to display or send SSTV transmissions, without using a bulky computer? SSTV Pad lets you decode and display Ham (Amateur) Radio SSTV (Slow Scan TV) transmissions. Just connect your device to an HF radio (or even set it next to the radio's speaker), tune in an SSTV frequency, and watch the pictures. SSTV Pad decodes all of the popular SSTV modes, including Robot, Scottie, Martin, and more. Some modes are receive only. \n\nDecoding of SSTV transmissions begins automatically as soon as the start of image audio signals are detected, and the image format is automatically selected. Manual control is also available for use when receiving conditions are poor. Timing signals (phase and skew) can be adjusted to compensate for mismatches with the sending station. \n\nReceived images can be saved - including automatically as they are received. You can leave the app running unattended, and come back to view all the received images. You can review saved images, as well as send them via email, and use iTunes file sharing to transfer them to your computer. You can even share them on your Facebook page, or tweet them to your followers, directly from the app! (iOS 6 and later)\n\nYou can also transmit images, taken from your saved photos or taken with your device's camera. Text, such as your callsign, can be added to the sent image.\n\nBuy your copy right now, and start decoding and displaying SSTV transmissions in minutes. Just set your iPhone or iPad next to the radio speaker, and watch the pictures come rolling in.\n\nNote: If you cannot see the transmit button, go to the Accessibility settings for your device and turn Button Shapes OFF. It makes the buttons too large so you cannot see them all. \n\nAlso, It is very important to have a well tuned signal of good quality, and make sure you get the audio from your radio to your device without adding additional distortion, or auto start and mode detect will not work optimally. Please see this page for tips on using the app and connecting your radio: http://www.blackcatsystems.com/ipad/iPad_SSTV_Pad_FAQ.html\n\nYou can also use Bluetooth audio devices to feed audio into your device. Please be sure to use a good quality Bluetooth device, that does not distort the audio.\n\nModes supported for reception (not all modes can be transmitted):\nB&W 8 sec\nB&W 12 sec\nB&W 24 sec\nB&W 36 sec \nMartin M1\nMartin M1\nMartin M2\nMartin M3\nMartin M4\nMP73\" \nMP115 \nMP140 \nMP175\nMR73 \nMR90\nMR115 \nMR140 \nMR175 \nPD 50\nPD 90 \nPD 120 \nPD 160\nPD 180\nPD 240\nPD 290 \nRobot 12C\nRobot 24C\nRobot 36C\nRobot 72C\nSC-1 32 sec\nSC-1 16 sec\nSC-1 8 sec\nSC-2-60\nSC-2-120\nSC-2-180\nScottie S1\nScottie S2\nScottie S3\nScottie S4\nScottie DX"

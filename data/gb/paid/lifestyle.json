When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

If you move the device after it has been calibrated you will need to recalibrate, simply click the \"Back\" button, move the device to a new area, then click \"Calibrate\" again.\n\nThere are 12 music box songs that his app randomly chooses from when it calibrates.\n\nThe sensors used are:\n\nMagnetometer - This senses Magnetic and Electromagnet fields around the device\nAccelerometer - This senses any device movement and the slightest vibrations around the device\nBarometer - Detects any change in the Ambient Air Pressure around the device\nCompass - Detects the slightest change in magnetic interference to Magnetic North\nGyroScope - Detects the slightest movement of the device\nOrientation - Detects the slightest movement to the position of the device\n\nIf your device is missing any sensors, the app will still work perfectly well without them.\n\n\n** Disclaimer **\n\nUse at your own risk, I cannot be held personally responsible for you or any outcome (paranormal or otherwise) from using this app!"

      "label": "Pleasure Machine is a simple erotic game for couples with slot machine interface, and is ideal for heating up your foreplay.\n \nThe erotic slot machine features three rotating reels with displayed parts of the human body, erotic activities and time limits. By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings."

Even at low volume levels changes are accurately detected and transformed into a lightshow. It's the only TRÅDFRI App with a real fast Stroboscope! (Strobe)\n\nSome detailed features:\n\n\n****Audio options****\n- Microphone sensitivity sliders let you control how often music is turned into light (change)  and control silence detection. (dB)\n- Brightness control sliders manage the maximum and minimum brightness of your disco setup\n- Indicators to show when your thresholds are being 'hit' by the music. \n- LED indicator for TEMPO tap button indicating current BPM. \n-> Auto Disco (strobe, transition style)\n\n****Color Control and Custom Color Themes****\n- User configurable color themes.\n- Color control slider helps you set the saturation of bulbs.\n- Color range control\n- Transform any image from your library in a color theme.\n\n****Strobe****\n- New Color Strobe.\n- Rainbow Strobe.\n- Classic White Strobe\n- Custom Color Strobe \n- Strobe your own Custom Color theme\n\n-> Smooth, Snap or Mix Transition.

Designed to create a deeply relaxed state  of mind and empowered labour and birth. \n\nCreated by women for women, iHypnobirth, will help you feel positive about birthing your baby. \n\niHypnobirth contains tailored meditations for self-hypnosis and positive birth affirmations each created specifically for labour and birth.\n\niHypnobirth features the following hypnosis tracks; \n\n-Guided relaxation for self-hypnosis \nA guided hypnosis that prepares the mind for a relaxed state of mind and calm birth \n\n-Guided meditation with positive birth affirmations audio\nA longer relaxation with positive birth affirmations that will resonate deep within the sub-conscious\n\n-Positive birth affirmations \nThese are positive statements about pregnancy and birth which resonate within the sub-conscious allowing you to embrace a positive birth experience \n\niHypnobirth was created by Psychologist & hypnatal practitioner Dr Alex McKay and NLP trained Charlotte Maslen. With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

Delicious. \n\n5 Star - Fantastic!! \n(UK iTunes review)\nI didn't think that this application would be up to the same standard set by the book (which is THE definitive cocktail bible), but I couldn't have been more wrong! It's every bit as informative as the book, and the fact that it's interactive - it lists the cocktails that you can make from the drinks in your cabinet - makes it even easier to use. And at the price of half a pint of beer, it's astonishingly under-priced for such a brilliant application.\n\n5 Star - Marvelous \n(UK iTunes review)\nLooks as good as the books, fits in the pocket......."

      "label": "This Spiritual Healing Meditation by Glenn Harrold will help you to heal energetic imprints and clear karma and energy blocks. Glenn is one of the world's most successful hypnotherapists and this recording was inspired by the intense ceremony work he undertook over a four month period at a Shamanic healing retreat in Panama. It is also influenced by the plant medicines of South America.\n\nEach and every one of us has an invisible energy field that surrounds us and which is alive with information. Trained visionaries, psychics and Shaman can see this subtle energy field which holds lots of information about you, both from this lifetime and your past lifetimes.\n\nWithin this energetic field there can be blockages and imprints that hold you back and prevent you from reaching your potential. Repetitive behavioural patterns that you find it hard to shake are often caused by karmic blocks in your energy fields. By absorbing the hypnotic suggestions on this recording you will be able to heal your energetic body of imprints from the past, raise your consciousness and clear karmic patterns that have been with you for lifetimes.\n\nWhen you heal yourself spiritually it will naturally follow that you will heal yourself physically and emotionally. Glenn recommends that you continue to use this recording as often as you can as the healing process can have many layers and life will continue to throw up challenges and issues for you to deal with. However, as you progress and more things clear in your energy fields, you will feel much lighter, and you will begin to regain your true nature and the essence of who you are.\n\nThis Shamanic influenced Spiritual Healing Meditation can help you heal your mind, body and spirit of energetic blocks and raise your vibration and consciousness. When you do this you become lighter and clearer and you step into your authentic self. Namaste.\n\nIncludes:\n• Spiritual Healing Meditation (awake) 38:48 mins\n• Spiritual Healing Meditation (sleep) 41:31 mins\n\neBooks\n• About The Author\n• How To Use This App\n• Guide to Self-Hypnosis"

Just fullscreen fireplaces on the TV!\n\nThe fireplaces have crackling audio too (you can use your TV's remote to change its volume).\n\nSo go ahead, turn off the lights and set the perfect mood, with a fire going on your TV! :-)\n\n** A Chromecast device or Google TV is needed to use this application.

      "label": "Ravit is a fun app that enables you to discover inspirational patterns and yarns, update your projects and stash and browse and post to Ravelry forums from anywhere. It's super quick, and it's friendly. Ravelry on mobile has never been easier.\n\nFIND INSPIRATIONAL PATTERNS\nIf you’re not sure what you’d like to make next, Ravit lets you easily browse patterns, favorite them, download and view pattern PDFs, view project photos and browse a designer’s other patterns and pattern suggestions. \n\nAnd if you want to narrow your search, choose from dozens of filters including craft, availability, category, attributes, needles, weight and more. You can even combine multiple options with AND, NOT or OR. It's powerful, but easy.\n\nThere's so many beautiful patterns on Ravelry, and Ravit helps you find them easily.\n\nTAKE RAVELRY TO YOUR YARN STORE\nFind out which yarns you’ll need for a project. Check what yardage you need. Look in your stash to see if you’ve already got a yarn, or one that’s similar. And because Ravit is designed to work nicely on your iPhone or iPad with readable text and buttons you can tap, you won't be squinting as you find all the info you need when you're at your LYS.\n\n+ Search all yarns by keyword, filter by fiber, weight, attributes and many others, and sort by options including 'Most projects' and 'Highest rating'. Quickly view pattern suggestions and projects for a yarn.\n\n+ Access your stash offline. No wireless or cell signal in your yarn store? No problem! Your stash is cached on your device so you can search, sort and view your stash offline.\n\nSNAP, EDIT AND UPLOAD ON THE SPOT\nPerhaps you're making a project on the train to work, or relaxed on the couch at home - whenever you are inspired to share your WIPs, Ravit makes it easy to snap photos, enhance with powerful photo filters, and upload to Ravelry, all from the one app.\n\n+ Powerful Photo Editing Tools - enhance, crop, and adjust your photos before your upload and show your work in it's best possible light. You can remove blemishes, improve color balance, sharpen images and access many other pro editing tools all from within the app.\n\n+ Optimized for Ravelry - before images are uploaded, they're resized optimally for Ravelry, so you'll upload smaller photos (up to 10x smaller!) more quickly and using less data.\n\n+ More than just photos - you can update notes for your Projects, Queued Projects and Stash, as well as most of the other info such as yarns, yardage, skeins, colorways, and color for your stash, and progress, link to stash, rating, craft, and tags amongst others for your projects.\n\nIT'S ALL THE LITTLE THINGS...\nSo why use Ravit? It's all the the little, sometimes hidden touches which make Ravit shine. Here's a few of them.\n\n+ It's quick - if you tap on something, you go right there. \n\n+ Infinite scroll - smooth, continuous scrolling as you browse to find inspiration.\n\n+ Offline - whether you're commuting underground, or you're off-grid, Ravit lets you access your Projects and Stash offline.\n\n+ Clean, uncluttered interface - we want your work and the beauty of Ravelry.com to shine. \n\n+ Use up to 50%* less data in Ravit compared with your web browser. \n\n+ Squint less - The text in Ravit isn't made super small, and we're fully Dynamic Type compatible, so if you change the font size on your device, it'll change in Ravit.\n\n* Based on tests of browsing patterns, projects, stash and yarns on Ravit and Safari on the same device - YYMV! (Your Yardage May Vary)\n\nTHIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\nRavit has many features already, but we are constantly enhancing and adding more features. We have an active group on Ravelry and we'd love to hear what you'd like to see next - join in the discussion at http://www.ravelry.com/groups/ravit\n\nRavit is not affiliated with ravelry.com. It is an independent app, developed by a husband and wife team. You can read more about why we made Ravit at http://www.enhancient.com/ravit\n\nDownload Ravit now and hop on to Ravelry."

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

He has dedicated his life to his own spiritual development and teaching, as well as offering peace and comfort during times of loss and bereavement. “To see a group of students walk out of one of my workshops inspired, awakened, motivated, and energized is all the gratitude that I need,” John says. “If I somehow help them to start their own journey, then I’ve done my job.” \n\nAuthor of the bestsellers Power of the Soul, Born Knowing, Psychic Navigator, and 101 Ways to Jump-Start Your Intuition, John also hosted his own weekly radio show on Hay House Radio, Spirit Connections. He has become a familiar face on TV on programs such as the A&E special Mediums—We See Dead People, as well as appearing as a psychic authority on the History Channel’s Psychic History. John’s story was originally profiled on CBS’s Unsolved Mysteries. \n\nFor further information about John, to find out about his series of workshops and other events, or to sign up for his free email newsletter, visit: www.johnholland.com"

From Polynesian (Tahitian, Samoan, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as pricking, painting, or staining. Sailors on the voyage later introduced both the word and reintroduced the concept of tattooing to Europe.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat — see military tattoo. In this case, the English word tattoo is derived from the Dutch word taptoe (OED).\n\nThe first written reference to the word tattoo (or tatau), appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard Captain Cook's ship the HMS Endeavour: \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humor or disposition\".\n\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by the explorer James Cook, when he returned in 1771 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\". Before this it had been described as scarring, painting, or staining\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\n\n\nA tattooed man's back, Japan, c. 1875\nUsage of the terms \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"pieces\", and work\" is gaining greater support,[citation needed] with mainstream art galleries holding exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs. Beyond Skin, at the Museum of Croydon, is an example of this as it challenges the stereotypical view of tattoos and who has them. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word irezumi means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using tebori, the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or for that matter, any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is Horimono. Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing."

      "label": "NEWS:\nFamily Tracker was used to locate a missing child - see news report on: http://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-app-missing-idUSBRE8460GZ20120507\n\n***SUPPORT NOTICE**** \nWe do help everyone who contacts us via our iphone@logsat.com email address, but unfortunately most users give bad ratings without ever contacting us for support. Please do contact us if you have any issues, we're always there to help! \n*************** \n\nFamily Tracker allows you to track your wife, husband, children and fiancée. You can now find out where they are, at anytime, as long as they have their phones with them. Family Tracker is available for other platforms as well, so you can track (and be tracked by) other devices as well - check our website for more details. \n\nPlease note that starting with the new iOS4 and supported hardware, Family Tracker runs in the background at all times, and, unlike previous versions of Family Tracker, user intervention is **NOT** needed for you to track them. Family Tracker runs at all times, continuously updating the GPS location of the device. Even if the iPhone is rebooted, Family Tracker will automatically resume tracking and updating its position! \n\nSo how does this work? \n\nSimple. Install Family Tracker on the iPhone/iPad you want to track. From then on, you can use either a web browser or via the Family Tracker app itself installed on your own iPhone/iPad to locate your family member. \n\nIf the device you wish to track does not support multitasking (for example, older iPhones 3G, iPads), you can still use Family Tracker to locate the family member. Using the web or your own iPhone, you will be able to \"ping\" the other iPhone. This is done by sending the other iPhone a (free) “Apple Push Notification” which will cause an alert to sound on your family member’s iPhone, even if the phone in is stand-by, just as would happen if the iPhone receives an SMS. As soon as this alert is acknowledged, their GPS position will be recorded, and their location will be updated on a map. If you are using an iPhone yourself to track them, you will be sent a Push Notification to inform you that the family member has accepted your \"ping\". These notifications will be automatically re-sent every 60 seconds until they are acknowledged. If the recipient is trying to ignore them or does not hear them, this repetition will help acknowledging them. \n\nFamily Tracker does not need to know your iPhone cell number to function, as it does not send SMS messages for notifications. Your email address is instead used to send free Apple Push Notifications to the iPhones being tracked. These notifications are free, specific to our Family Tracker application, and work anywhere in the world as long as the iPhone and/or iTouch being tracked has internet access via the cellular network or WiFi. \n\nNotice: ***Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.*** For this reason, we strongly recommend users to configure Family Tracker to use the \"Driving Only\" accuracy in the GPS setting. This special mode updates the GPS location only when a significant location change occurs, which results in a tremendous gain in battery life.\n\nAdditional pro features, such as the ability to see the past locations for the previous 2 weeks, and the ability to set geofences so you are alerted when users that you track enter or leave certain areas are available via an optional iTunes subscription.\nSubscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions are available for either $1.99/month, or $5.99/3 months, or $9.99/6 months or $19.99/year. Privacy policy & terms of use: http://logsat.com/family-tracker-privacy.asp"

Astral Dreams is specific to it's purpose of getting you off the ground and out of your normal levels of consciousness. \n\nAstral Projection - 4 specific frequency sets (3 using Chakra frequencies)\n\nLucid Dreaming - 2 powerful frequency sets\n\nShaman - These 2 sets are frequencies used by American / South American Shamans and also Tibetan Shamans.\n\nSleep - 2 frequency sets for deep sleep with and one without vivid dreams \n\nTBSW - Two new TBSW presets - one for Astral states using Epsilon and Delta frequencies and the other for Deep Sleep.\n\nWhy different frequency sets? We, as individuals don't always respond to a single set of frequencies. Our vibrational rates and even electrical characteristics change throughout the day. With Astral Dreams you are more likely to find the frequencies that match YOU.\n\nAstral Dreams uses the latest Binaural Beats technology - pure Trilateral Balanced Sine Waves (TBSW). These special wave forms are like binaural beats on steroids. They are optimized to cover both hemispheres of the brain, producing much stronger effects than standard binaural beats. There\nare also 3 frequency combinations + 1 instead of 2. This is a pyramid waveform.\n\nIn addition, there are background sounds. These are high quality and don't sound annoying (like someone rattling a piece of tin to sound like thunder). \n\nBackground Sounds Include...\n\n* Brown Noise\n* Pink Noise\n* White Noise\n* Fan\n* Shower\n* Rain\n* Tent Rain\n* Thunderstorm\n* Forest\n* Ocean Waves\n\nMore Features :\n\n* Long audio fade out at the end of the sessions, so you aren't jolted from a dream or sleep\n\n* Smooth Audio Transitions\n\n* Great easy-to-use interface with new chrome guards\n\n* Selectable times\n\n* 3 types of selectable Noise backgrounds to drown out background sounds in your environment like TV's, radios or people \n\nGET ASTRAL DREAMS NOW - YOU'LL LOVE IT! :-)"

      "label": "Happiness app\n\nOmar Khyam “Be happy for this moment.  This moment is your life”\n\nWith the latest Meditation and Relaxation techniques, this app will ease every muscle in your body, offering you Complete Relaxation.\n\nBeautifully read by Heather Prince who is a daughter, sister, Aunty, Mum of 3 and Grandma of 3.  Having experienced grief of divorce and loss of friends and family, she understands that each stage of life brings different challenges.  At times she believed happiness would be reached when she achieved a certain weight, when the kids were more independent; when someone else was happy; when she moved house, when she bought “those amazing shoes”... and she wishes she knew then what she knows now, as a teacher of mindfulness relaxation and Spiritual Response Therapist.\n\nHappiness is not just about money, fame or success.  It’s about positive experiences, feelings of contentedness and peace of mind.\n\nTrue happiness is something that lasts for long and not just a sudden boost of mood.\n\nTherefore, after working with many people who have been seeking HAPPINESS, Heather has put together this visualisation so that you can go easily into a state of deep relaxation and feel the happiness within.\n\nMeditation needs to be experienced, and you need to develop over a period of time to really experience what it’s all about because it doesn’t happen overnight. So decide your level of commitment now. She suggests you listen to this meditation every day for at least the next 6 weeks and it will result in feeling real happiness... the sort that makes your heart glow and gives you the reason to get up in the morning.  \n\n\nWe're very proud of this app and hope it will leave you HAPPY!"

      "label": "EVP SHIFTER\n\n3 Sound Banks - 2,000 sounds each (6,000 total). Audio is played in randomized \"Bursts\".\n\n1 Noise Banks - Contains no speech sounds. Made from the inter frequencies across the AM/FM/SW/VHF/UHF bands.\n\n4 Band Equalizer - Adjust the Low, Mid, Upper, and High ranges of frequencies.\n\nMic Feedback Delay  - Automatically turns on the Microphone when audio is played. This creates a Feedback Loop by feeding the audio's output back into itself.\n\nYOU MUST RECORD! - The app is designed for Enhanced EVP Communication. Recording your session and then reviewing the audio is critical for receiving messages. The app should sound incoherent, the audio coming through should just be gibberish unless something or someone is using it to communicate. Listening and deciphering messages takes practice, you learn to develop an ear for it over time. If you don't know how to record, look up how to use the built in record feature in IOS.\n\nESTABLISH A CONNECTION - This app may not work for everyone. Establishing a connection to the other side is very important for receiving messages from beyond. An open mind and a focused approach will yield better results. If there's no connection then no messages will come through. Meditation helps. \n\nHOW IT WORKS - When you turn on the app it activates the 3 sound banks that automatically adjust their Scan Rate at random and independent of each other. The audio is played in randomized bursts rather than a continuous play. The pitch of the sound is constantly changing. We used a Pitch Shifter effect to periodically create stutters or disturbances in the sound. The Resolution, Frequency, Time, and Amplitude is constantly being shifted. Echo, Phaser, and Chorus audio effects are randomly turned on and off with their intensities randomized as well. We use a combination of the Chorus, Phaser, and Flanger audio effects to implement what is known as Comb Filtering; applying a delayed version of a signal to itself. This creates a variation of a Feed-Back Loop that is known to be an important element for spirit communication. The app also has a \"Mic Feedback\" feature that turns on the microphone whenever the audio is being played (in a burst). It then turns the mic off when the audio stops playing. This creates a feedback loop by feeding the audio output back into itself. It's important to note that very little communication is heard in \"Real time\" during the sessions. Though it is possible for this type of communication to take it is not what this app was designed to do. The main focus of this app was to facilitate Enhanced EVP Communication, so recording your sessions and reviewing the audio is essential for using this app. \n\nThis app is made for audio experimentation by ITC/EVP researchers and is often used by ghost hunters/ paranormal investigators. \nResults may vary.\n\nNote: the IOS version of this app is unable to support mic input and external speaker output at the same time. When mic feedback is turned on, audio will come out of the device’s speakers regardless of connected external speakers. To use with external speakers, please keep mic feedback off."

Then this app is exactly right!\n\nThe pouring of lead is an old tradition that was used by the ancient Romans to predict the future: A piece of lead is melted in a spoon (by holding a flame under the spoon) and then poured into a bowl of cold water. It immediately solidifies and forms strange shapes. The interpretation of these shapes is very exciting and makes a lot of fun together with friends. Maybe a new love is coming up if you see a kissing couple or a long journey, if you recognize a ship. Let's surprise and your imagination run wild!\n\nUnique: Real random shapes. You get a one of a kind shape at every pouring. It is up to you to interpret these shapes - that's the real fun ...\n\nSend your poured lead to your friends via mail or take a screenshot (home button + off switch simultaneously pressed) for the photo album.\n\nIf you run out of ideas for an interpretation, the integrated lexicon helps."

Say, with fireworks and maybe a marching band?!  Well, Countdown to Launch will help you do just that!  This simple little app gives you:\n\n•\tA photo-realistic numerical countdown display\r\n•\tA spot for a motivational photo of your choice\r\n•\tA customizable phrase for what you are counting down to\r\n•\tCustomizable fonts (two choices) for that phrase\r\n•\tOptional photo-realistic fireworks display upon completion\r\n•\tOptional celebratory music upon completion (Pomp and Circumstance for graduations, or Stars and Stripes Forever from John Philips Sousa for everything else)\r\n\nHeck, why stop at big moments in history?  Why not countdown to the end of the work week, or work day, or work meeting?!!  You get my drift... life needs more celebrations!"

Ova aplikacija do detalja opisuje šta znači naziv supstance koja je dodata, da li je bezbedna po ljudsko zdravlje i u kojoj meri.\n\nAplikacija ‘IZBEGNI ADITIVE’ je aplikacija koja vam pomaže da identifikujete, prepoznate i zaobidjete aditive koji potencijalno mogu ugroziti važe zdravlje.\nImajući u vidu činjenicu da su mnogi aditivi, koji su korišćeni kao bezbedni, nakon 10, 15 ili čak 20 godina isključeni iz upotrebe zbog dokazane genotoksičnosti, kancerogenosti, neurotoksičnosti i sličnih neželjenih dejstava, ova aplikacija pruža uvid u sve aditive, koji su dozvoljeni za ljudsku upotrebu, a za koje postoji sumnja da mogu biti štetni.\nNaučnici već godinama objavljuju studije kojima upozoravaju da mnogi dodaci hrani (označeni E-brojevima) izazivaju kod ljudi sindrom hiperaktivnosti, alergijske reakcije, glavobolje ili poremećaje u metabolizmu. Nažalost, odgovorne institucije na ta otkrića uglavnom odgovore previše sporo, jer su istraživanja koja govore u prilog štetnosti supstance radjena na životinjama i dokazi su ‘nedovoljno pouzdani’. \nPrimer za to je genotoksični E171, za čije su neželjene efekte naučnici upozoravali još 2008.godine, ali bezuspešno. Ovaj aditiv je tek 2022. godine, nakon 14 godina, zabranjen za ljudsku upotrebu.\nAplikacija je napravljena za sve ljude koji su svesni ovog problema i koji ne žele da u svoj organizam i organizme članova svoje porodice unose potencijalno štetne supstance.\nU aplikaciji, navedeni su svi aditivi, koji su zakonski dozvoljeni za upotrebu sa kratkim opisom, koji govori u prilog bezbednosti ili potencijalne štetnosti aditiva i sortirani prema bezbednosti/štetnosti na aditive označene crvenom bojom, narandžastom bojom, zelenom bojom, tako da:\nCRVENA: aditiv je potencijalno opasan po zdravlje – IZBEGAVATI\nNARANDŽASTA: aditiv je srednje opasan po zdravlje -NE KONZUMIRATI ČESTO\nZELENA: na osnovu dosadašnjih saznanja, aditiv je bezbedan po zdravlje – NE UGROŽAVA ZDRAVLJE\nVažno: pojedini aditivi, iako označeni zelenom bojom, kod odredjenih ljudi mogu izazvati neželjene reakcije. Primer za to je aditiv E330 - limunska kiselina, koji se uopšteno smatra bezbednim, ali postoje primeri iz prakse koji govore u prilog tome da ovaj aditiv kod pojedinih ljudi izaziva alergijske reakcije.\nSvi podaci iz aplikacije su podaci iz studija odradjenih na životinjama."

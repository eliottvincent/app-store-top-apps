      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "The Spirit Talker works in a similar way to the world famous Ovilus device.\n\nIt produces words and speech based on what the sensors in your phone are detecting.\n\nThe theory behind this app is that spirits might be able to manipulate the device to say and show relevant words and responses to questions being asked during a paranormal investigation. \n\nThe Spirit Talker is a modern form of ITC (Instrumental Trans Communication) and is very simple to use.\n\nJust click start and begin asking your questions. When a response is detected by the app the words will show visually in the text box along with audible speech.\n\nWhen you have finished your session just click stop. You can also look back at the responses you received during your session by clicking on the folder button (this only works when the scanner is \"Stopped\").\n\nThe EMF Meter only works if your device has a Magnetometer Sensor. If not then the EMF Meter won't be displayed. Please check the compatibility of your phone / tablet.\n\n** Disclaimer **\nUse at your own risk.

      "label": "HOWL is your essential dog-walking companion.  With dog theft happening country-wide, it’s time to bite back against dog thieves.  Designed by a dog-lover and former criminal defence solicitor, HOWL is a movement intended to frustrate dog thieves at every turn.\r\n\r\nDownload now for £1.79 per user for lifetime access.  No subscription, in-app purchases, catches, or hidden fees.  Each user (including your emergency contact) will need the HOWL app for maximum benefit.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION IS BETTER THAN FOUND\r\n\nWho knows what ordeals dogs suffer when they’re stolen?  Those that are found are usually damaged, displaying changed behaviours, and sometimes physical illnesses or injuries.  That’s why we believe that Prevention Is Better Than Found.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the HOWL app:\r\n-\tSecurely stores your dog’s details on device only in case the worst happens (acting swiftly is vital);\r\n-\tAllows your emergency contact to monitor your location during your dog walk;\r\n-\tSends your contact an alert if you HOWL for help during your walk;\r\n-\tHas a built-in alarm so you have a personal alarm without carrying more stuff; \r\n-\tSecures evidence of an incident including video, geotag and what 3 words location data so that you can spread the word quickly, and assist the police investigation.\r\n\r\nPRIVACY IS EVERYTHING\r\n\nAll information you input into the HOWL app stays on your phone unless and until you export it.  Even we can’t access it.   \r\n\r\nThe code you pass to your emergency contact is unique to each walk, and even if someone intercepted it, it would be nonsense to them.  Absolutely no personal data will ever leave your phone and no account is required.  Only your chosen emergency contact will be able to know your location via HOWL.\r\n\r\nYour location is only monitored when you activate a “walk” in the app, and the monitoring ends when you end the walk.  We can’t access the details of your pack, your location information, or any video footage you might film via HOWL.\r\n\r\nCHANGING YOUR THINKING\r\n\nThieves don’t care about prison sentences; they care about being caught.  Every criminal hopes they’ll get away with their offences. HOWL is here to change that.  Evidence is what gets thieves caught.  HOWL is here to redress the balance by empowering dog lovers with ways to stay safe.\r\n\r\nHOWL IS A POSITIVE MOVEMENT\r\nThe HOWL app is the icing on the (dog-friendly) cake.  Underpinning the app is advice about how to become less of a target for dog thieves.  We’ll challenge your thinking about how and where you walk, suggest small changes to your habits, and empower you with knowledge that thieves wish you didn’t have.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\n-\tCreate your pack in HOWL – the only limit on the number of dogs and contacts is your phone’s available memory;\r\n-\tEverything stays on the phone until you decide to share it;\r\n-\tYour emergency contact can monitor your walk in real time;\r\n-\tHelps you act quickly if a thief approaches;\r\n-\tTake back control from dog thieves in a non-confrontational way;\r\n-\tCollect direct evidence to share with the police;\n-      No account or personal data used, 100% privacy."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats. If you want to hear the complete Athan you should open the app at the moment of the Athan.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nتطبيق صلاتك رفيقك للحفاظ على صلاتك.\nعن طريق تحديد موقعك  تلقائيا، بإمكان هذا التطبيق أن يعلمك بأوقات الصلاة وكذلك تحديد اتجاه القبلة. تطبيق صلاتك يستعمل عددا مهما من الطرق الحسابية  المعتمدة في أغلب العالم الإسلامي. اعتمادا على موقعك، يختار التطبيق طريقة الحساب والمدرسة الفقهية المناسبة. \n\nحول خصائص التطبيق \n---------------------\nإذا كنت ممن يستعمل صلاتك على أنظمة أخرى، المرجو الانتباه إلى أن هذه النسخة لا تحتوي على بعض الخصائص مثل \"التحويل إلى الصامت\" كما أن بعض الخصائص الأخرى مثل \"الأذان الكامل\" و\"إضافة أذان من الذاكرة\" لا تشتغل إلا إذا كان التطبيق مفتوحا. يرجع ذلك إلى بعض القيود التقنية الموجودة حاليا في نظام أبل وسنحاول دعمها حالما ترفع هذه القيود.\n\n\nحول سماع الأذان \n---------------\nمن ناحية  أخرى إذا كان عندك مشكل في سماع التنبيهات، المرجو التاكد من أن الإعدادات التالية مفعلة في هاتفك : \n1) الإعدادات > الأصوات > تنبيهات التذكير\n2) الإعدادات >التنبيهات > صلاتك   \n3) هاتفك ليس في الوضع الصامت والصوت في مستوى جيد\n\nحول مواقيت الصلاة:\n-----------------\nننوه إلى أنه رغم المجهودات لتدقيق مواقيت الصلاة التي يقوم بها فريق صلاتك، إلا أنه في بعض البلدان قد تكون المواقيت غير مضبوطة بشكل تام، في هذه الحالة نرجو منكم الاعتماد على المواقيت الرسمية في بلدكم أو المسجد القريب منكم، مع العلم أنه يمكنكم تعديل الأوقات يدويا في نافذة الإعدادات.\n\nنصائح من أجل استعمال أفضل \n-------------------------\n\n1- حتى يتم تحديث إشعارات الأذان إحرص على فتح التطبيق مرة كل أسبوع على الأقل أو عندما تغير مكانك أو يتغير التوقيت في بلدك (التوقيت الصيفي)\n\n2- تطبيق صلاتك يشعرك بدخول وقت الصلاة على شكل تكبيرتين أو 4 تكبيرات. إذا أردت أن تستمع إلى الأذان كاملا المرجو أن تفتح التطبيق أثناء الأذان."

Our algorithm analyses your voice and compares it with data from over 150 celebrities to let you understand your voice and learn how to improve it.\n\nThe Standard version of the app gives you a full analysis of your voice in terms of depth and variety and calculates a set of celebrity matches to give you a grounding of what your results mean.\n\nThe Pro version helps you improve your voice. Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too. We want to cover things like smoothness, nasality, vocal fry, even creating a rating of how attractive your voice currently is, based on the latest research.

I was inspired to create this app while participating in the three year program of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies.\n\nNote: This app does not teach shamanic journey practices. Visit the Mindful Bear website for links to shamanic educators, books, and practitioners."

When its wisdom is sought with sincerity and sensitivity, this ancient Chinese oracle will promote success and good fortune and impart balance and perspective to your life. Its lasting popularity lies in the profound lessons it teaches about how reliance on one's higher qualities leads to life's greatest rewards: well-being, understanding, and peace of mind.  \n\nNow available as an elegantly designed and easy to use iOS app, it is both highly accessible to new users and a revelation to those long familiar with the text. Throw your own coins, or let the app cast for you, and make the wisdom of the sages your own. Includes a journal for recording your questions, results, and thoughts.\n\nBrian Browne Walker is the author of celebrated contemporary translations of the I Ching, Tao te Ching, Hua hu Ching, Wei wu Wei Ching, and Art of War which are published by Harper and St. Martin's Press and translated into over a dozen languages around the world. His \"I Ching, or Book of Changes\", long beloved for its clarity and accessibility, has received five star reviews on Amazon consistently for over a decade."

      "label": "Group Star Charts is an effective way to encourage good behavior using a simple and clear system of positive feedback based on awarding stars.\n\nThe app's appearance and user interface is deliberately simple to make it easy to use and understandable by children of all ages. There is a row for each child which clearly shows the number of stars they have. Tap a row to add a star (up to 99 or a chart-specific target, if required). It's that easy.\n\nTips to get the most out of a Group Star Charts:\n• Reward good behavior immediately so your child associates the awarding of a star with their behavior.\n• Don't take stars away. Rewarding positive behavior is more effective than punishing bad behavior.\n• For older children, setting a target number of stars to reach and sorting by star count can encourage healthy competition.\n• Create multiple charts for different behaviours or targets.\n• It's great for parents but can also be used by teachers or club leaders to track rewards for multiple groups of children.\n• Can also be used for adults, e.g. tracking scores while playing a board game.\n\n\nREVIEWS\n=======\n***** \"Everything I have found until this app have been either overly-complicated or too narrow in focus (just specializing in chores for instance). The multiple chart option allows me to customize stars/points based on any category of work or behavior that I want and the simple interface makes on-the-go tracking a snap.\" - Androshay, USA.\n\n***** \"I use this app for several large group classes I teach & it's been insanely popular with the kids (ages 3-7). They BEG to be quizzed on material we've covered so they can earn 'points'! Love the 'bing' sound each point makes when you award them, which can be heard across the room & really excites everyone. :). Recent update allows for multiple charts, so I can use them for different classes. Awesome!\" — Smokdrogi, USA.\n\n\nPlease mail support@hacknicity.com or see https://hacknicity.com/groupstarcharts for more information."

With six children between them they have first-hand experience of the power that self-hypnosis and positive affirmations have on pregnancy and birth. They believe that women deserve positive, empowered birth experiences and have created this app to equip them with the skills to achieve this. The effectiveness of hypnosis and relaxation on positive birth outcomes (shorter labour, lower rates of medical intervention, less medication use) is well documented in a number of research studies. \n\niHypnobirth teaches you that birth does not have to be full of fear, instead it will equip you with tools that can create a positive birthing experience, helping you to prepare both physically and emotionally.\n\nBy listening to the relaxation and positive affirmations regularly during pregnancy, this app will enable you to practice deep relaxation, effective breathing and positive visualisations to help you to have a calm, controlled, and empowered birth experience. If you learn to condition your body now it will be much easier to slip into a relaxed state during your labour and birth - and even after your baby is born these techniques will serve you well.\n\nBenefits of using hypnotherapy for birth \n\n-Positive approach birth\n-Calmer pregnancy\n-Creates feeling of empowerment \n-Reduce anxiety \n-Helps bonding with baby  \n-Reduces labour pains* \n-Shorter labour* \n-Less likely to have c-section* \n-Less likely to have pain relief* \n\n\n* Statistics from the American HypnoBirthing Institute 2008"

Some signs that the moon travels through are especially favorable for certain actions—find out the details.\n\n• This app has no subscription—it is a one-time purchase. You get all the daily information you need through 2050.\n\nYou have heard the buzz on social media about “moon void of course” or a “void moon” (both have the same meaning). You may be curious about whether you should pay attention to when the moon is void of course. By knowing when a void moon is upcoming, you can schedule actions to avoid those periods to create the most successful outcome possible. It is an app you will use quite a bit—you will want to check it every morning. \n\nSome days the moon never goes void, other days the moon will go void for a few minutes, and still other days the moon will be void for several hours—possibly for the entire day or, in rare cases, for several days. Every day is unique, so the void is never repeated in the same way, the reason you need Susan’s Moonlight app. \n\nIf you schedule a meeting when the moon is void, it will either be cancelled, or the meeting will come to nothing. Things will go on as they have before with no change. You should not schedule a first date or a wedding during a moon void period, nor should you sign a contract, have a job interview, or meet with the press during a void moon, as examples. It would not be a good idea to buy an airline ticket during a void moon, for you may have to exchange it later. If your action is vital, avoid the void. \n\nThis is an aspect that affects everyone uniformly, similar to Mercury retrograde.\n\nWith Susan Miller’s new appealing app, Moonlight, void of course periods are easy to find, understand, and navigate. The information is written in Susan Miller’s signature warm, optimistic style, and she uses no astro-babble language to confuse you. Until now, knowing when the moon is void required looking up the moon’s void of course periods on tables that are listed by Greenwich Mean Time and converting to your location. With Moonlight, the answer is a snap on Susan Miller’s app.\n\nWhat is the moon void of course, and when does it happen?\n\nThe void of course period of the moon begins when the moon has finished meeting with the other planets and has made her last EXACT major aspect to a planet or the Sun. Just as importantly, the moon must still be moving within the same zodiac sign as she was when she started receiving the planets. Once she has met with them all and is finished, the moon will go void of course. \n\nTo be precise, the moon may make an aspect to another planet. It could be a conjunction, square, trine, sextile, or opposition. These are the aspects that were outlined by the ancient Egyptian astrologer Ptolemy. Ptolemy is considered the father of the Western astrology we use today, and we call these aforementioned aspects “Ptolemaic” aspects. You need not be concerned about knowing what these aspects mean—Susan Miller does the work for you.\n\nAfter the moon has communicated with other planets each month, the moon rests, and as said, that ushers in the void period. As she rests, the moon cannot lend any of her considerable powers to you. That’s not good for any of us. We need all the help we can get from the graceful moon on a daily basis."

      "label": "QuiltPaper creates graph paper for quilters. More than just a 1/4” grid — a tap does much of the ‘drafting' needed for quilt design by adding borders, sashing, cornerstones, diagonals for triangles, and more.\n\nStandard graph paper grids are included. For example, design an on-point quilt by starting with included Diagonal Paper. Make your own expensive, hard-to-find specialty papers and EPP templates: hexagon, diamond, triangle, HST & HRT templates, tumbler, polygon, eight and six point star, honeycomb (Lucy Boston), jewel, kite, brick, log cabin, square, circle, arc, and pinwheel by adding InApp purchases.\n\nQuiltPaper also makes it easy to work with inspiration images because you can place an image ‘just so’ under a grid by adjusting the image to fit!\n\nOnce a setting is complete, the design can be brought into the Paint Tool (with the inspiration image!) for coloring with solids and textures. While there is an extensive color palette available, unlimited custom color palettes can be created by — \n• Taking colors from images or live camera\n• Setting RGB or HSB codes\n• Selecting colors on the color wheel\n\nNOTE — If you are looking for a quilt block library, you will not find one here. QuiltPaper app is for quilters who use a grid to plan and design a quilt. It is worth mentioning, however, that a few in-app purchase papers use a Pattern Planner tool that offers at least a minimum level of block planning. These papers are Pinwheel, Arc, and Log Cabin.\n\nEnjoy English Paper Piecing? \nMake your own EPP templates. QuiltPaper can create shapes at the exact size you need for your project. You can even place a circle at the center of each template to cut a hole for easier paper removal. Once the template page is set, it can be — \n•Printed to cut templates by hand\n•Exported as a PDF or SVG to laser and pattern cutting machines\n\nHST & HRT paper (InApp purchase) lets you make your own at the exact size you want — \n• HST. Set overall size and seam allowance for template.\n• HRT. Set overall size and seam allowance for template with trimmed corners for easier, accurate matching during assembly (no ‘dog ears’).\n\nPURCHASE INCLUDES 3 PAPERS:\nGRID — Classic grid graph paper taken up a notch! \nDOT— Choice of 5 dot styles and 2 dot patterns.\nDIAGONAL — On-point design graph paper.\n\n— FEATURES OF ALL PAPERS —\n√  Buy once — purchase works on all devices — iPhone, iPad, iPod.\n√  Metric (cm or mm) and Inch settings for grid and page size. \n√  Paint quilt layout with color and pattern. Make your own color palettes.\n√  Place an inspiration image under any grid, then adjust size and placement.\n√  Up to four line colors on a grid.\n√  Put multiple grids on a page to plan block designs, assembly, etc.\n√  Title grid with choice of font, size, bold or italic, and color.\n√  Print on standard sized page (such as 8.5x11 or A4) or set a custom size.\n√  Avoid the headache of scaling a design by setting the page at the quilt actual size by using ‘Custom’ page size setting.\n√  Library of Quick Pick templates offer inspiration  and a short cut to creating layouts.\n√  Print or share grids as a PDF, PNG or SVG to other apps for further editing — even as templates to laser or pattern cutting machines.\n√  Share painted grids as a PNG or PDF. \n√  Work up close using pinch-n-zoom gesture.\n√  Place a center-point on most papers. \n\nIN-APP PURCHASES unlock specialty papers: \nTriangle\nHST & HRT\nTumbler\nDiamond\nPolygon (especially helpful to make shapes for EPP)\nHexagon\nHoneycomb (Lucy Boston)\n8 point star (Lone Star)\n6 point star\nLog Cabin\nJewel\nJewel Ring\nKite\nBrick\nSquare\nCircle\nArc\nPinwheel\n\n• ‘All Papers Forever’ bundle. For the price of five papers get them all! \nCredit is given for earlier purchases. On purchase of a fifth paper the bundle is instantly added.\n\nDon’t see the paper you need?

It also provides a description for each phase, sign and mansion. You can navigate through the information in various ways — say, phase-by-phase, day-by-day or month-by-month - whatever is more convenient for you. \n\nPhases show you the energy of the day, signs — the mood of the day, while the void-of-course periods might tell you when it is better not to do certain things. Mansions were used by different cultures from the time immemorial, they tell for what a particular day is good or not so good.\n\nTo calculate the times, iLuna uses the time zone of the device on which it runs, so if your iPhone or iPod touch shows your current time correctly, iLuna's information is precise too.\n\nOnce any of the events reported by iLuna happens, you will get a notification, provided you allowed the app to send you notifications."

No problem, just create multiple projects, and give each of them their own name. \nPrefer to work in silence? Use the option to turn of the tap-sound, easy! \nDon't like the color theme of the app? Change it, there are many different options to choose from, and if you become a supporter of the app, the icon will also take on the color you select!\nOh, and don't worry about your screen turning off, as it will stay on while you are using the app, without draining your battery!\nUse the widget on the today view for maximum convenience!\nIf you have suggestions or complaints, use the email button top-right in the app to contact me directly.\n\n____________________\nWhat others said:\n\"If you need a simple counter, this is the app for you. It’s simple and easy to use. I’ve tried others but keep coming back to this one.\" - Lunanator\n\n\"It’s so simple but perfect. I can keep all my project counts in one place!\" - Anna706\n\n\"I do one project at a time that would require a counter. This is the first I’ve seen that is really easy! I love it!\" - nurse195829\n\n\"I am a totally blind knitter and use voiceover to read my iPhone screen. I have long wanted a row counter that was accessible to me. I found it! Works perfectly, and the sounds confirm that I have added or subtracted a row. The only thing that voiceover users want to know is that you need to double tap the pencil icon in order to make the project name text field active. This app is moving to the front page of my home screen! Thank you! Simplicity often means accessibility to me. Awesome!\" - ThaiFoodLady\n\n\"Its simplicity is great\" - hsbz. hsn \n\n\"i got it because i always forget to keep track of my stitches... it was so easy to use, i didn’t like the noise it made when you clicked it but i just turned it off. i also love how your able to choose what color you want!\" - milembh\n\n\"After trying several counter apps, this is by far by favorite.\" - H408\n\n\"I was looking for a counter app. Nothing fancy as I didn’t was one that took up a lot of memory on my device. Thus app is PERFECT. It’s super easy to use and a bit customizable too. If you are looking for a basic counter app, look no further. Thus app will meet your needs!\" - JB45840"

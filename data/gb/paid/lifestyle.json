      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

      "label": "Apple Watch, Nest Thermostat, and Siri. Together at last.\n\n＊ The app has Siri Voice shortcuts for seamless Siri control of your Nest, from the iPhone, Watch, iPad, and HomePod. It fully supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\n＊ The app lets you monitor and control HomeKit thermostats like Ecobee, and functions largely the same with them as it does with Nest, except for the Siri Shortcuts functionality which is not needed with HomeKit. It lets you see your thermostat info on the Watch complications, and control it using the iOS widget.\n_____________\n\n• Using Siri voice shortcuts you can control many aspects of your Nest, such as instant activation of heating or cooling, setting the temperature by saying how many degrees you want to set, increasing/decreasing the temperature, and setting the Home/Away state. Thanks to Thermo Watch, It's all finally just one casual \"Hey Siri\" away, all with informative visual and verbal feedback.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Thermo Watch complication to open the app. Spin the Digital Crown, or Swipe up/down to adjust the temperature. You can start adjusting the moment the app opens.\n• On your iOS device you can see the thermostat info on the home screen widget, you can swipe to the widget panel to adjust the temperature on the interactive widget, or you can just open the app. Again, you can start adjusting the moment the controls appear.\n• From your Apple TV, open the app, and swipe up/down on the remote to change the temperate.\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nThe app will let you know with a chime and a tap, that the thermostat has received and applied your command.\n\nMonitor your Thermostats and Home/Away status right from the watch face, using complications that update in the background, without having to launch the app.\n\nYou can use Siri on your iPhone, Watch, iPad, or HomePod to control any of your thermostats. Record phrases that make most sense to you, such as \"Start Heating\" or \"Make it Cooler\". If you have multiple thermostats you can control them individually, by saying for example \"Start Heating Upstairs\" or \"Start Cooling the Living Room\".\n\nVisit https://thermowatch.net/siri website for the detailed instructions of Siri operation.\n\nSet Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nThe app supports multiple thermostats in multiple homes - just swipe left and right on your Watch screen to access them, or see them all at the same time in the iOS Widget and the app. Fahrenheit and Celsius are both supported.\n\nBeyond that, you can press the Watch screen firmly for additional functions, like switching to a heating or cooling mode, setting the away status, choosing the active temperature sensor, or turning the fan on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nThermo Watch does not collect any of your data. Your login information, thermostat settings, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Thermo Watch does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

Though we are not exactly sure how this process is done we know that it involves the modulation of sound waves in a manner that will change it’s characteristics on to a recording device.They may also communicate in real time (Opportunistic EVP). Simply put, spirits can change sounds in order to form speech and therefor have the ability to communicate.\n\nFeatures:\n4 sound Banks\nOptional Microphone input\nAudio effects that are fully adjustable including Echo, Reverb, Noise Gate, and Pitch.\n4 Band Equalizer\nVisual ITC feature that uses the first ever Virtual Video Feedback method.\n\nThis paranormal app is made to work similar to that of a ghost box by providing \"raw audio\" that spirits can use to form speech. This device can be put on your phone so you can have it with you, you never know when you might end up at a haunted location. You have to work on building a connection with the other side. This will help improve your communication. \nDisclaimer:\nThere is no guarantee you will be able to communicate with spirits or ghosts. Results may vary. Use at your own risk."

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate.

What a sight!\n\nThe app has Siri Voice shortcuts, and they can be used to set your home into Away or Home state using Siri on your Watch or iPhone, as well as to display the live feeds from your cameras.\n\nThe app supports Apple Watch LTE, and can work when the iPhone is not around - as long as the watch itself has internet access (either LTE or WiFi).\n\nThe app is fully functional with an initial purchase. The in-app purchases are used only for giving a tip to the developer.\n\nWatch Cam lets you monitor all your Nest Cams from the Apple Watch or the iOS Widget.\n• From the watch face, tap on the Watch Cam complication to open the app. Swipe left and right to view life feeds from all your Nest Cams.\n• One of the watch complications shows you the snapshot from the camera of your choice, right on the watch face. The snapshot updates periodically all on its own, so you'll have a recent view of your camera any time you look at the watch. Useful when waiting for that package to arrive.\n• On your iOS device you can swipe to the widget panel to see what's on all of your cameras.\n• View the continuously updated Live Feed from the camera in the watch app, the iOS widget, or the iOS app. The feed updates with a new image approximately every second on the iOS and two seconds on the Watch - may be faster or slower, depending on your network speed.\n• Use the digital crown on the Watch to zoom in and out, or tap the screen to toggle zoom levels.\n• Use the pinch gesture on the camera views in the iOS app to zoom in and out. Single tap toggles the zoom level in the iOS app and the iOS widget.\n• Turn the device to landscape mode to increase the camera views sizes.\n• Double tap on the Live Feed view in the iOS app or the widget to launch the Nest app.\n• Set Geofence around your home to reliably set the Home and Away state when you come and go.\n\nWatch Face Complications can display the following:\n• Snapshot from the camera of your choice that updates periodically.\n• Status of all the cameras - if the camera icon is green, it means that all your cameras are online and streaming. If it's dimmed, it means that some cameras are off.\n\nYou can long-press the Watch screen for additional functions, like setting the home/away status, or turning the camera streaming on and off.\n\nWhile the app's minimalist looks betray the simplicity of its operation, what they don't show is the amount of planning, design, development and refinement that went into it, ensuring it becomes something that is enjoyable to use and experience.\n\nPlease Note: Watch Cam does not collect any of your data. Your login information, camera feeds, and any activity - all of it flows exclusively between your devices and Nest. Author of Watch Cam does not receive any of it, at any point.\nThis app and its developer are unaffiliated with Google Inc. or Google Nest. Nest is a trademark of Google Inc."

Notifications will remind you when it is time to put out each type. Use the Apple Watch App or Widgets to quickly see your next collection.\n\nUse Siri shortcuts to ask when the next collection dates are for all bin schedules, which bin schedules are due on the next collection date, or when the next collection date is for an individual schedule. Manage shortcuts in Bin Day Alert's settings screen, the Shortcuts app, or in the Siri & Search section of Apple's Settings app.\n\nThe app supports a wide range of collection schedules, making it suitable for use at home or business premises: a specific day each week; multiple days each week; a specific day every 2, 3, 4 or 5 weeks; or a specific day on one or more weeks of the month.\n\nEach schedule can have up to two alerts. Each alert can either be for the day before or the day of the bin collection. Snooze an alert notification by 15 minutes if you're busy right now, or by 1 day/week if a public holiday has temporarily changed the bin schedule.\n\nGoing on vacation? There's a single setting to quickly disable all alerts.\n\nBack up your bin schedules to iCloud Drive, Dropbox etc. for safekeeping. Easily share your bin schedules with neighbors so they don't have to configure the app themselves."

      "label": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC"

Glenn is one of the world's best-selling hypnotherapists with multi-million sales of his Apps, CDs, MP3s and 7 self-help books.\n\nGlenn was a regular 20-a-day smoker until he quit forever in 1987 and he understands the smoking habit from personal experience. He has created these two unique hypnosis recordings to help you to become a non-smoker by reprogramming your unconscious mind. This way, being a non-smoker will feel completely normal and natural to you. \n\nOn both hypnosis audio tracks you will be safely guided into a very deep state of mental and physical relaxation and then given multiple post-hypnotic suggestions that you don't smoke, and that you will remain a non-smoker forever. Glenn's utilises his skilled hypnotherapy techniques to help you break all past associations with smoking, which completely removes the struggle from stopping smoking. You will also be given positive suggestions and affirmations to prevent you from putting on weight or substituting any other negative patterns of behaviour in place of the smoking habit. In fact when you stop smoking your motivation and desire to keep fit and healthy will become stronger than ever. \n\nQuitting Smoking is easy with hypnotherapy, as this method is uniquely effective in programming the mind to overcome the addiction to cigarettes and nicotine. Glenn's highly acclaimed hypnosis techniques and production will help you achieve this goal in a safe and natural way. \n\nThis App Includes:\n\nHypnosis Audio Tracks\n• Stop Smoking Now 31:31 mins\n• Stop Smoking Forever 28:22 mins\n• 12 Minute Sleep Booster\n\neBooks by Glenn Harrold\n• De-Stress - The 8 Golden Rules\n• The Ultimate Guide To Self Hypnosis\n• How To Use This App\n• About The Author\n\nStop Smoking features two powerful hypnotherapy sessions containing:\n• Glenn's highly acclaimed hypnosis techniques guiding you into a deep state of mental and physical relaxation.\n• The very latest state-of-the-art recording technology.\n• Background sound effects recorded in specific musical keys and frequencies to compliment the hypnotic suggestions and enhance the deep trance effect.\n• Hypnotic echoed backing vocals panning from left to right across the stereo range - a unique hypnotic effect.\n• Powerful subliminal suggestions embedded under the fade out music to maximise the overall effectiveness of the recordings.\n\nGlenn has over 20 years experience as a full-time hypnotherapist and works with many celebrity clients. He has appeared on TV a number of times and his successful hypnotherapy sessions are often featured in newspaper and magazine articles. Here are some of the many endorsements Glenn's receives from celebrities and journalists amongst others.\n\n\"I have downloaded - Deep Sleep, Lose Weight and stop smoking... I no longer smoke, I have lost 18 Lbs... and I have some of the best and deepest sleep ever... I swear by these CDs... My thanks to you Mr. Harrold...and anyone who doesn't believe me can drop me an email anytime, and I will confirm this for them.\"\nDetective Anthony La Femina, New York City Police Dept -15 Years Joint Terrorism Taskforce, Surveillance Division. Email: inklinations1@optonline.net\n\n\"I was startled by the effectiveness of this self-hypnosis audio\"\nSophie Campbell - The Sunday Telegraph \n\n\"I did feel pretty rough for a few days (after my hypnotherapy session with Glenn) as my body was missing the sugar, but that soon passed and I feel I'm finally free of my sugar cravings and chocolate addiction! I tried a piece of chocolate to see what happened and it tasted horrible!\"\nAndrea Mclean (TV Presenter)"

Though the casting of runes cannot divine the future, for those who consult them regularly, they  can provide insight into the road ahead or the paths one might take at any given time.  The runes can be consulted on any matter of importance and multiple castings can be used to find any of a number of perspectives from which to proceed. If one approaches the runes in an honest and sincere manner, the insight they can provide is often surprisingly accurate to the situation at hand. Viking Runes offers up the following features:\n\n• The full set of 25 Nordic runes, including the 16 reversals.\n• Five different rune spreads of varying sizes and detail.\n• Beautiful rune casting effects, utilizing movement and force touch gestures.\n• Share pictures of your casts through email, text, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\n• Save your rune casts along with any notes to an in-app journal.\n• Companion Apple Watch app for instant insight into a situation.\n• Easily study each rune meaning in one convenient screen."

BARRY FITZGERALD & ROBB DEMAREST FROM GHOST HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL.\n\nI am so happy to announce the release of the Sv-1 SpiritVox for iOS!\n\nThere are 2 channels of random noise. Channel 1 is the ORIGINAL SV-1 SpiritVox sound & Channel B, the NEW SpiritVox Random carrier signal. The NEW \"Noise Blend\" feature allows you to blend the 2 signals any way you wish for more ways to experiment.\n\nThis version of the SV-1 iVox also features REAL TIME RECORDING. Meaning you can use headphones, ear buds or an external speaker and listen to what you are recording as it is being written to disc! This method when used with a speaker is the heart of my \"ECHOVOX\" system.\n\nI am now recommending leaving wifi on and using headphones due to the overwhelming amount of reports of this being effective by SpiritVox users.\n\nI hope you enjoy this new version of the SV-1. \n\n*******\nHardware \"Spirit boxes\" can cost hundreds of dollars and are difficult to build yourself. They are also open to radio interference and random phonetic sounds. The SV-1 SpiritVox is capable of producing results you can be confident in for a FRACTION of a hardware device! This is one tool your research group cannot afford to go without!\n\nSpiritVox on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/bigbeardaudio/videos\n\n*For best results turn your devices volume to 10, place on a hard surface with your device speaker facing down and prop the device up 1/2 to 1 inch above the surface. External speakers are recommended if you are using a phone without a loud speaker. Tablet speakers have been found to work very well and seem to be loud enough on their own.\n\nSpiritVox is trusted and used by over 400 Paranormal Research teams around the world! Including North London Paranormal, Paranormal Moms, Ghost Night Events UK and more!\n\n\nQuestions? Got results you would like to share?

Garden Organic has aimed to ensure this app will be of real practical use and cover every aspect of vegetable growing using organic methods.\nOrganic gardening methods harness the natural cycles and processes that promote plant growth. The app will help users care for the environment and to cut their ‘carbon footprint’ by ‘reducing, reusing and recycling’ resources, while creating a flourishing growing space.\n\nWhy organic gardening matters Gardening and growing offers great benefits for us all – benefits for the environment, for people’s health and wellbeing, for food security and for building stronger communities. Our outdoor growing space, be it the private garden, community garden, allotment, school garden, or just a small space nearby, is a place where we relax and recharge both spiritually and physically. It is also a place where we can learn and reconnect with nature and the food we eat and where we can take practical action to adopt sustainable lifestyles.\n\nUsing the organic approach to gardening and growing, which Garden Organic has been promoting for over 50 years, will ensure that these benefits can be achieved and enjoyed to their full potential."

      "label": "Priya Vaishnava Jan, Hare Krishna\nAll Glories to Sri Sri Radha Madhava Ji\nThis app is made for Vaishnava who observes Ekadasi or Mahadvadasi Fast for pleasing Sri Sri Radha Madhava.\nSince the dates of the fast are governed by lunar motion, it becomes difficult for the calendar maker to predict Parana time and dates for different geographic locations.\nNowadays technology has made it possible to predict these times with the help of software with which I have tried to make this mobile. This is an attempt in which I don’t think would have been possible with my own effort and intellect but could do it by the Grace of Sri Sri Radha Madhava and offer this creation in the Lotus feet of Sri Radha Madhava with the hope that it will help Vaishnavas observe fast in the different locations of this globe.\nI know with all the work that has gone into it there must be still shortcomings and mistakes for which I seek apologies in the feet of Vaishnava jans and request to verify these dates with your local temples from where you have been already referring for these times and dates. \n\nThis app is based on the rules put forth by Goswamis for deciding the dates of Ekadasi and Mahadvadasi fast.\nOnly Vaishnava Ekadashi is Supported!\n\nTechnical Features of the app :\n*The app is designed to show the Upcoming Ekadashi Vrat Observing date & Parana timings as soon as you open the app.\n*Katha for the Ekadashi’s are also available\n*Selection of current location can be done manually (latitude, longitude) or by using GPS or web database.\n*Notification support is available with different frequency settings\n*Home-screen widget helps to know the Upcoming Ekadashi Fast on the go\n*Year Calendar View is available wherein all the Ekadasi Fasts are sorted by months\n*Rules of observing Ekadashi fast are included\n*Sunrise time and Brahma Muhurta Timings for the selected locations are also displayed\n*Easy to use UI\n\nYou can feel free to contact us at - contact@itsraghav.com for any suggestions. \n\nDownload Ekadasi App Now\n\nHare Krishna"

      "label": "Founded and created by Sam Saunders\nHi, I am Sam Saunders, aka The Baby Guru.\nMother of 4. Infant sleep trainer. \nIn the last 10 year’s, I have helped between 450 to 500 babies, with sleep coaching, weaning and working with parents on routine.\n\n\nYOUR PERSONAL SAM\n\nThe app is easy to use and intuitive, it is for parents who would like help in getting their little one to sleep in their crib or cot. I teach you my tried and tested methods with an easy to use simple app, with emojis and animations. \nAlso, voice commands, so that you can listen to me when you are busy.\n\n\nRESPONSIVE INTERACTIVE PROGRAMME\n\nIt is a responsive sleep coaching app, an interactive, detailed step by step guide, which gives you real time help, responsive to your babies’ reaction to sleep coaching. Helping little ones learn how to settle themselves independently to sleep without the need to feed be rocked or a dummy replaced every time it falls out. So that when they wake in the night or early from a nap they are able to go back to sleep themselves. \nA personalised graph showing your baby’s sleep progress by day.\n\n\nFULL OF ADVICE \n    • Bedtime routine \n    • Naps how many and for what ages \n    • What to do when teething or poorly \n    • When not to start sleep coaching \n    • How long does sleep training take \n    • What to do when away from home \n    • How soon will I see progress \n\n\nONCE DOWNLOADED THE APP CAN BE USED AT ANY TIME, SO IF THINGS SLIP AND OLD HABITS OR NEW HABITS START, THEN LOG BACK IN AND HAVE THE SUPPORT AND TOOLS TO GET THINGS BACK ON TRACK. GETTING THAT ALL IMPORTANT GOOD NIGHT’S SLEEP AGAIN FOR ALL. \n\n\nTWO METHODS FOR DIFFERENT AGES \n    • 4 – 6 months \n    • 6 months plus\n\n\nNB: Only use the programme if your little one is fit and healthy.\n\n*****************************************************************\n\nMore About Sam - Background\n\nSam Saunders - The Baby Guru, has been in midwifery and helping parents for over several years in the NHS and Private Sector.\n    • Sam the mother of 4, saw a need for a bespoke service to help parents with their babies, in their formative months, from thebabyguru.co.uk, was born.\n    • Being the go -to advisor and building up a fan base of parents around the world, Sam realised that she could not be in several places at once \n    • One day when she was in Switzerland she had a eureka moment, when clients were “whatsapping“ her in the middle of the night , and so due to popular demand the baby guru app was born \n\n\nWhat parents are saying \n\n    • Sam Silver – Co Founder -  Thisismothership.com  \n      “Sam’s help and guidance was invaluable in helping me get my three year old to go to sleep independently and sleep through the night \nHer tips worked fast, were efficient, yet still warm.” \n\n    • Sam genuinely listens to your concerns and provides practical advice and next steps tailored to your individual needs – she got my baby sleeping through the night within 7 days of contacting her.

      "label": "The FOUNDATION FOR INNER PEACE, original publisher of \"A Course in Miracles,\" has joined with CDE Solutions to produce this app as an aid to those working on their daily lessons from the Workbook of the Course. -- NOW AVAILABLE IN 5 LANGUAGES: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish. As a student of the Course have you ever spent time studying your lesson in the morning only to forget to review it at the suggested time intervals during the day? Have you ever wished that you had reminders, preset at the required time intervals, to jog your memory? Have you ever remembered to review a lesson but forgot what words to use? If so, then this app is for you!\n\nIn addition to providing convenient access to the full text of the 365 daily lessons from the Course's \"Workbook for Students,\" THIS APP HAS BUILT-IN REMINDER ALERTS which have been preset with specific text to be remembered for the day and the time intervals as suggested within the lessons of the Workbook. For lessons that have no suggested time intervals, you can select a time interval of your choice. You can even override Course specified intervals to time intervals of your choice that fit in with your daily schedule. The app is simple to use. To begin you would select the lesson you are currently working on from a rotating \"wheel,\" then when the wheel stops on your lesson of the day you click on \"Full Text\" and you are presented with the full text of the lesson. Once your beginning lesson has been selected you will be presented with the same lesson when you return the next day. This allows you review the previous lesson, or move on to your daily lesson. The complete Workbook, including Introductions, can be accessed from the wheel. During the day, shortened text (the words suggested within the Workbook lesson to be used as the reminder that day) is presented when the reminder alert is sounded. These words can be changed to whatever words you would prefer to use instead. In addition, you can choose what sound you’d like to hear as a reminder, when you want the reminder to start, and when you want it to end.\n\nYou purchase the app ONLY ONCE for all devices.\n\nAbout \"A Course in Miracles\":\n\nThe Course’s teaching is based on the practice of forgiveness as the key to inner peace and the remembrance of God. While the app contains the text of the complete \"Workbook for Students\", it represents only part of the Course, a unique self-study metaphysical thought system.\n\nPublished in one volume, \"A Course in Miracles\" consists of three separate sections: \"Text\", \"Workbook for Students\" and the \"Manual for Teachers\". The \"Text\" section of the Course sets forth the theoretical concepts of the Course's thought system and thus provides the necessary framework to clarify the meaning of the \"Workbook\" exercises. It is therefore important to undertake the lessons in this app in conjunction with the writings within \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\n\"A Course in Miracles\" was received in its entirety over a period of seven years by psychologist Dr. Helen Schucman through an inspired process she described as scribing. In 1975 the Foundation for Inner Peace, co-publisher of this app, was chosen by Dr. Schucman to be the publisher of the only original edition of \"A Course in Miracles\".\n\nThe \"Workbook for Students\", contained in this app, includes 365 lessons which are designed to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. As stated in the Introduction to the Workbook: “The exercises are very simple. They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them. They need no preparation.” You are asked only not to undertake to do more than one exercise a day. You might however choose to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day."

      "label": "3 years in the making. Now featuring pro quality reverb, the famous \"Hindi\" based bank D, upgraded audio engine now recording mono wav 44.1 files, a whole new mode, reversed playback and more.\n\nThe learning curve for 3.0 is pretty steep for the new user.\nYou can also get help from me and over 1,000 other users worldwide at: www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers\n\nDEMO VIDEO IS IN PRODUCTION.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THIS SOFTWARE IS CPU INTENSIVE AND RUNS BEST ON NEWER DEVICES. \n\nECHOVOX System all-in-one Echo based Real Time EVP recording system from the creator of SpiritVox.\n\nEchoVox is a real-time amplified recording system used to create a bed of random chaotic noise using random phonetics, microphone input and a natural loop recording echo. Delay time can be set from anywhere to 0-10 seconds. This means what you are hearing is the actual audio being recorded to disk in real-time, as it happens.\n\nEcho has been shown to contribute to EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon)\n\nNote: The Echo is not a digital effect added to the sound. It is a loop of the actual recording. An external/BlueTooth speaker is recommended for the best results, also the louder the better.\n\nFEATURES:\nECHO WITHOUT RECORDING\n6 CHANNELS OF RANDOM PHONETIC AUDIO\n4 SOUND BANKS.\nSTUDIO QUALITY REVERB\n44.1 WAV REAL-TIME AUDIO RECORDING\nNEW \"BURST\" MODE*\nNEW AUTO BLEND/AUTO SHUFFLE\nMULTIPLE DELAY SETTINGS\nMIC GAIN INPUT CONTROL\nPLAY,FF,REW,SLOW,SPEED UP,REVERSE AUDIO FILES WITHIN APP FOR REVIEW\nUPLOAD TO SOUNDCLOUD\nFILE BROWSER\nNAME SESSION AT START\nCUSTOM REVERB PRESETS (.ievrp) CAN BE SAVED AND TRADED.\n\n*Random burst of random sounds from random banks for a random amount of time\n\n\nCONTROLS:\nEach channel has independent playback speed control + on/off.\n\nMic gain controls microphone input volume\n\n\"Auto Blend\" \"Shuffle\" blends across the 6 random audio channels\n\nEcho starts recording to disk.\n\nTHEORY: This is the result of years of experiments in the field, it is still a work in progress. The echo is actually a chaotic loop of the chopped up vocal samples and environmental sounds. A virtual soup of sound and frequencies impossible to predict.\n\nThis system has been used and tested WORLDWIDE. On live television in India and South America. Featured on televisions \"Ghost Trail\" and \"Seekers\" and more. EchoVox is simply the #1 most trusted and widely used app by both pro's and \"armchair\" paranormal investigators.\n\nEchovox is used by Barry Fitzgerald of TV's Ghost Hunters International and Bill Murphy of TV's Fact or Faked Paranormal files, Chris Flemming of Psychic Kids and Robb Demarest of Ghost Hunters International and other leaders in the paranormal field.\n\nEchoVox is NOT just an app, it is not a toy. \n\nIt is for use by serious investigators and is not for the casual user.\n\nThe best way to learn more about EchoVox:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/bigbeardaudio\n\nJOIN THE FB GROUP: www.facebook.com/groups/echovoxusers\n\nI support my work 100% and want to help you learn to use this correctly and help with any issues.

Sick of being frustrated at your beloved friend? Remove this one frustration and love having your dog more! Puddle & Pile will quickly learn your dog's toileting patterns and alert you before accidents happen.\nWhen your dog relieves, simply bring out your phone and record the action. Over just a few days Puddle & Pile will learn when your dog needs to be outside and it will bark, so you can save your floor! Consistently responding to puddles and piles alerts by giving your pooch a garden tour will help you toilet train your dog quickly.  Record every success or accident and see how quickly praise outweighs frustrations.\n\n\n- Or why not just use it to remind you even with older dogs that outside time is needed.\n- Customize the background with your favourite pooch picture. It's your dog's App!\n- Grow together with more positive times\n- Share your dog's history with others who may be looking after them.\n- Share your dog's history with your vet if there are strange patterns for an easy diagnosis.\n- Inspired by a continual puppy raiser for Guide Dogs Victoria.\n- Thank-you for the positive feedback. Please rate this app positively if you find it useful. It helps more than you may think. :-)\n- ENJOY YOUR DOG!\n\nREVIEWS\nIt works - byOttlight - Sep 26, 2015\nI've been having a problem house breaking my 4 1/2 old puppy. I started using this app and she was accident free the first day. It's very accurate nearly to the minute she has to go potty. I emailed the info to the puppy class trainer. It's very easy to use.\n\nFantastic App!  - byHot K - May 6, 2014\nI LOVE this app. I really needed something to help me make heads or tails out of mine & my new puppies day so we could have a smooth, fun house training process. Well, this app provides that! It certainly delivers what it promises & more! The app is easy to use & fun. It sorts out all the patterns of our new Sproodle & I feel less stressed. Def give this app a try if you haven't house trained a dog before, or maybe even if you have :)\n\nGreat tool!  - bymanwdaplan - Apr 24, 2014\nAmazingly accurate at predicting my dogs needs. Also, a very simple and clean (and cute) interface that makes the training process much less frustrating.\nLove this app! \n\nbyJonasfann1 - Apr 20, 2015 - Really very cool for any owner of a new puppy! LOVE using this app!!"

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "NEWS2 Calculator is designed to make it easier for healthcare professionals to calculate NEWS or NEWS2 scores during the assessment of acute illnesses in patients.\n\nThe NEWS and NEWS2 are scoring systems which use six physiological parameters, which are recorded in routine practice, to give an aggregate score which can be used to determine the best response for acutely ill patients. The six parameters are:\n- Respiratory rate\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Systolic blood pressure\n- Pulse rate\n- Level of consciousness\n- Temperature\n\nA score is allocated to each parameter during measurement. A larger score means the parameter varies more from normal levels.\n\nNEWS2 Calculator has options to colour code the controls based on their value (for example, when changing the value of a parameter which would give a score of 3, the control turns red). The colours are based upon the NEWS2 chart which healthcare workers are already familiar with, making NEWS2 Calculator extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThere is also an option for alerts to appear which provide further guidance for healthcare workers on the best course of action to take, based upon the NEWS or NEWS2 score which was calculated.\n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application has been designed to assist pre-hospital, community and hospital clinicians to calculate a National Early Warning Score for patients who are unwell.

      "label": "Clinical veterinary practice: the satisfaction of knowing that you have done the best for your patients; isn’t that what we all want?\n \nEmergency medicine can be busy and stressful with sometimes many seriously ill or injured patients. When managing these patients you need the convenience of quick reliable information. What is more convenient than your phone in your pocket or your tablet?\n\nThis is where the KIMBA Veterinary Emergency Medicine Small Animal app comes in.\n \nGot a dog in hypovolaemic shock from acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome? Need a quick reminder of cardiovascular perfusion assessment? What about guidelines on fluid resuscitation and a fluid dose calculator?\n\nGot a tomcat with urethral obstruction (“blocked cat”)? Need a quick reminder of management priorities? What about how to treat clinically significant hyperkalaemia including drug doses and a dose calculator?\n\nWHAT FEATURES DOES THE APP OFFER?\n \nDrug dose calculators:\n•\tSingle doses\n•\tSingle agent infusions\n•\tMultiagent infusions, including separate morphine-lidocaine-ketamine (MLK) calculator\n \nFluid therapy calculators:\n•\tBolus calculator\n•\tInfusion calculator\n \nDrug formularies:\n•\tMost commonly used emergency medicine drugs with doses, routes and extra comments\n•\tSeparate searchable canine and feline formularies\n \nOther features: \n•\tExtensive ‘5-minute consult’ style information on a variety of emergency complaints and disorders – including all the classics!\n•\tQuick check data including e.g. physiological parameters, potassium and glucose supplementation charts, and CPR drug doses\n•\tSeparate sections on transfusion medicine and on neonates\n•\tClinical image gallery including radiographs and ECG strips\n \nThe app is downloaded to work offline offering guaranteed reliability irrespective of your practice’s internet connection.\n \nWHO IS THE APP FOR?\n \nThis app is for veterinary surgeons and nurses/techs working in small animal/mixed practice. It will be most valuable to those dealing with emergency patient. But oh wait, isn’t that all veterinary practices?! The calculators and formularies are especially useful regardless of how many emergency patients you see.\n \nThe app will also be very helpful for veterinary students (doctors, nurses/techs) as a learning resource and clinical tool. Including in those stolen moments between seeing a case and having someone quiz you on it. We’ve got your back!\n \nWHO CREATED THE CONTENT?\n \nShailen Jasani created the app. He is a small animal veterinary Emergency and Critical Care (ECC) specialist (Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care). He has extensive experience in both primary care and referral practice (www.shailenjasani.com, www.veteccsmalltalk.com). Shailen also has considerable teaching experience, especially with primary care vets and nurses/techs and with students.\n \nBased on this experience, Shailen has created an app that provides practical help to colleagues working in clinical practice.\n \nPlease note that Shailen is very happy for you to contact him (see below). With questions about the educational information provided or queries about small animal ECC in general. But please do not get in touch with urgent questions about active cases as Shailen may not be able to respond in a suitable timeframe.\n \nCONTACT INFORMATION and OTHER RESOURCES\n \nIf you have any problems with or comments about this app please get in touch with Shailen via email at shailenjasani@gmail.com or on Twitter @VetEmCC.\n \nFor more veterinary ECC resources, check out: the FREE Veterinary ECC Small Talk podcast available in Apple Podcasts, SoundCloud and on the Veterinary ECC Small Talk website (www.veteccsmalltalk.com/ecc-resources/). You may also wish to join our private Facebook group/page.\n \n*This app is a clinical tool that will help you to deliver the best care to your patients. Got an emergency? Relax, you’ve got it covered*"

A major advantage of using real teeth is that many show interesting and unusual features, which would be seen on dental patients.

      "label": "The way we think determines both how we feel and how we behave. The way we think about ourselves, other people and our place in the world has a direct influence on our emotional state and our behaviour. Consequently by changing the way we think we can positively influence our mood and how we respond to situations.  This is the premise behind Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which has become the most effective psychological treatment available for a range of emotional and behavioural problems including depression and anxiety. \n\nA thought diary is designed to help people record and change the thoughts that cause emotional and psychological distress. The Thought Diary Pro is the advanced version of the Thought Diary, and allows the  identification of thinking errors (also known as 'cognitive distortions'), and the the modification of our unhelpful thoughts into more productive ways of thinking. By challenging the thoughts and beliefs that cause discontentment, dissatisfaction and other emotional and behavioural distress, we can improve our mental health and can change the destructive or adverse behaviours we may engage in as a result of our negative thoughts. \n\nThought Diary Pro is designed to be the second step in changing our thinking patterns by helping individuals identify the thinking errors that they engage in, and thereby helping change these thoughts. The effect of modifying these thought can reduce the negative emotional and behavioural consequences of experiencing these negative thoughts. Similar to the Thought Diary, the Pro version was designed by an experienced clinical psychologist and CBT therapist who believed that these tools should be available in the most accessible form for individuals to use in today’s fast technological world. It can be used by people either in therapy as a useful adjunct to the treatment, and there is a feature that allows the Thought Diary to be emailed straight to their therapist. However, it can also be used by those individuals who are embarking on a self-guided course of CBT."

      "label": "Pelvic Floor Trainer - Squeeze during pregnancy and after birth is your guide for rehabilitation and strengthening of your pelvic floor after giving birth. The App was developed by experts and ensures that you exercise correctly.  \n\nUse the App as a motivation for making pelvic floor exercises an integral part of your daily life. It is your tool to have at hand at all times. Now, you can squeeze correctly – anytime and anywhere. \n\nWhy are pelvic floor exercises so important?\nPregnancy and birth strain the pelvic floor muscles that can also slacken with advancing age. Pelvic floor exercises are important, in order for you to rediscover your body and be able to do all the activities you were used to doing before getting pregnant. Many women experience difficulties holding in urine after giving birth, for example while running, jumping on a trampoline or when laughing, sneezing or coughing. It is scientifically proven that pelvic floor exercises have a significant effect on incontinence, both before, during and after pregnancy. But as with any training, it’s all about getting started as soon as possible and training both properly and regularly.  \n\nFunctions:\n\nThe app has several functions that ensure successful pelvic floor training. \n- Reminders\n- Photos\n- Videos with exercises \n- Sound files\n- ’My downloads’:Your downloaded videos and sound files, which you can also use offline.\n\nThe exercises are divided into three levels, ensuring that everyone can participate regardless of the individual level. \n1. Beginner\n2. Slightly experienced\n3. Very experienced\n\nDeveloped by experts\nThe App is developed by physiotherapist Ulla Due in cooperation with midwife PhD Sara Kindberg from GynZone."

After qualifying, he completed a placement at Hangzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China.\n\nHe taught at The London College of Traditional Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (LCTA), the largest institution dedicated to teaching Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in England, for ten years. He was a Senior Lecturer and a Clinical Supervisor on the BSc Acupuncture course. Paul has been involved in training literally hundreds of today’s acupuncturists and herbalists. He now teaches at The College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM) just off of Oxford Circus, and The City College of Acupuncture, just off of Old Street.\n\nPaul is the chief presenter on “How To Locate Acupuncture Points: The Definitive DVD”, and has been published in many magazines, such as Yoga Monthly, Lifescape, Natural Health, CAM Magazine, the Dragon’s Tale, and the Chinese Medicine Times.\n\nTessa Whittaker LicAc, MBAcC\n\nTessa originally worked with and rode horses. She was encouraged to study Chinese medicine by her Shiatsu teacher and came to LCTA to learn acupuncture. Throughout her time at the College, Tessa also learnt yoga and intuitive movement – a freedom of expression that is now part of her everyday life. She now works with the Parkinson’s Recovery Project using Yin Tuina and visualization techniques on unmedicated Parkinson patients. Her riding background has inspired her to explore the use of Chinese medicine in the equestrian field, particularly Five Element riding and training techniques.\n\nABOUT SILENCE SPEAKS LTD\n (Luis Melendez)\n\nLuis is an American citizen originally from New York City whose personal journey into mind-body exploration began in 2001 when he experienced spiritual healing for the first-time while living overseas in Northamptonshire, United Kingdom. The experience, which on the surface was very unassuming in terms of setting and administration, proved transformative resulting in the life-long pursuit of Self-knowledge including completion of two spiritually-orientated academic degrees with The University of Portsmouth (BScHons Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, 2010) and University of Northampton (MScHons Transpersonal Psychology and Consciousness Studies, 2017).\n\nhttp://www.acupunctureforme.co.uk\nhttp://www.hypnosisworks.nyc\nhttp://www.silencespeaks.co.uk"

      "label": "This App was designed specifically to help those in the medical field as well as individuals who deal with wounds on a daily basis. It is meant to replace the need for using unsanitary paper rulers and other unsanitary means of measuring the width, height, and depth of a wound on a patient or yourself. This saves you not only the cost of a separate measuring device each time a wound is measured, but also helps to reduce the chance of infection that can come from touching a measurement device to an open wound. \n\nWith the Wound Measurement App, you can measure a wound opening one-handed, reducing some of the problems that can come with measuring a wound in a difficult spot. Once the measurements are complete, a label with appear above the wound with the measurements and you can save a picture of both the measurements and the opening all at the same time, saving you time and effort. \n\nUsers now have the ability to add patient information to the label including Patient ID, Patient Name, and Wound Location. The date and time appear on the label automatically to help you keep track of when a measurement was taken.\n\nWe respect the privacy of our users and their patients. We cannot and will not access the camera or photos remotely. Please note that the app will need to be allowed to use your phone’s camera only to take the measurements, and it will need to be allowed to save a photo to the photos library. If you do not wish to keep a photo, you can always go to your photos library and delete anything you don't want to keep. We also don’t collect or ask for any information from the user, we feel that your apps and information belong to you, and that you should have complete control of your privacy.\n\nLike most people, we don’t like having to see adds all over the place, so we don’t use any adds in this app. \n\nFeatures List:\n-Simple to use, with easy access to instructions.\n-Easy, one-handed operation.\n-Augmented Reality, tested for accuracy.\n-Does not require internet or cellular connection to take measurements or save photos.\n-Sanitary - nothing touches the wound.\n-In poor lighting conditions, the flashlight can be turned on from within the App.\n-Allows you to track the healing process easily and visually through photos saved from the App.\n-Users can add information to the wound label (Patient ID, Patient Name, Wound Location).\n-Date and time now automatically appear on the wound label to help you keep track of the healing progress.\n-Light or Dark mode\n\nCompatible with iOS devices from iPhone 7 and up.\n\nFor the best results in Augmented Reality, keep the phone perpendicular to the surface you want to measure."

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

This can happen to men and women, although it is more common in women. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can help to prevent and treat these problems, reducing pelvic floor, bladder and bowel symptoms and supporting the active lifestyle that is important for general health.\n\nSqueezy CF has been designed by chartered physiotherapists specialising in Pelvic Health working in the NHS. It is suitable for everyone who wants to do pelvic floor muscle exercises (also called Kegel exercises). The app is particularly aimed at those who are seeing a specialist physiotherapist for problems connected to their bladder, bowels or pelvic floor muscles as it can be tailored to a specific exercise programme and set to remind you when to do your exercises. It is simple to use, discreet, informative and has helpful visual and audio prompts to support your exercise programme plus it maintains a record of the number of exercises you have completed.\n\nFeatures:\n • Apple Watch support! Be extra discrete, squeeze from your watch\n • Customisable exercise plan\n • “Professional mode” to help physiotherapists set detailed exercise plans for patients\n • Visual, and audio guides for exercises\n • Information and tips written by professional Pelvic Health physiotherapists\n • Track and monitor your progress\n • Write a short note after a completed exercise\n • Simple and clear interface"

This app is the newest member of that catalog and allows the user to test their knowledge base by answering multiple choice questions in the major disciplines associated with thoracic surgery: adult cardiac surgery, congenital cardiac surgery, general thoracic surgery, and trauma and critical care. Each of the four disciplines is subdivided into important categories with approximately 10 questions per subject. The user selects the best answer and is immediately notified if their choice was correct. The notification contains the correct answer and, usually, an explanation for the correct answer and the incorrect options. Answered questions are stored on the device as either answered correctly or answered incorrectly, providing the user the opportunity to review their previous attempts. Questions can be reset to allow the user to repeat the questions as needed.\n\nTSRA resources are provided as a basic guideline for the study of cardiothoracic surgery and should be used in conjunction with a variety of other educational references and resources. TSRA resources should not be construed as definitive study guides for either the TSDA In-Training Exam or the ABTS Certification Exam. TSRA makes no claims regarding the study guide’s value in preparing for, or its contribution toward performance on, either the TSDA In-Training Exam or the ABTS Certification Exam.

Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent or stop the progress of CKD. If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you! Last update: June 2017.\n\nA number of features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\n\n• Is this food good for me? Answer to the common question about suitability of various food items for your personal situation, in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\n\n• This publication is the only one in the market that offers dietary guidance for CKD AND its combination with the following most likely health issues: anemia (iron deficiency), diabetes (types 1 and 2), obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, stress and Vitamin D deficiency.\n\n• Separate guidelines for patients who need to consume: less phosphorous, less potassium, or more potassium. Also included is a detoxification diet to reduce the burden on kidneys and improve the immune system.\n\n• Top-5 items to do or eat, and the top-5 things to avoid.\n\n• Recommendations on the best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping.\n\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group.\n\n• Suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\n\nThe content of this app is licensed from Personal Remedies, LLC. The primary sources used by Personal Remedies are US government sources such as USDA (US Department of Agriculture), NIH (National Institute of Health) agencies, and leading clinics & universities.\n\nPersonal Remedies is the publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions. Based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world. Our thanks to Janice Zaleskas, MD (Nephrologist, Lahey Clinic, MA) for her suggestion to produce this app.\n\nThe information presented by this app is updated by our team as needed and on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads of a new version of the app.\n\n“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\n\n “Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\nMass General Hospital (Urology); Harvard Medical School\n\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \nLahey Clinic, Hamilton, MA"

      "label": "The Airway Triage App can be used by all health care professionals in any clinical situation in which airway management is needed.\nWith the easy to use PHASE and HELP-ET checklists the airway of your patient can be triaged within minutes into basic or advanced. This is the best airway assessment tool to clearly define basic airways that can be managed with basic airway management techniques by a trained person. Advanced airways should be managed by medical personnel with advanced airways skills and special equipment may be needed.  Complexity factors that may make airway management very challenging can be found and used to make an airway management plan. This is the first airway assessment tool that implements human factors, vital signs and the surgical procedure. The app can be used in pre-assessment clinics, in the operating room environment, in the ICU and emergency department for patients > 12 years old or prior to procedural sedation.\nWith the Circles of Life airway approach you can check  if you are “fit-to-fly with this patient for this airway management procedure”.\nThe Circles of Life approach can be used by trainees to evaluate the progress of skills and training and can also be used by experienced airway managers to seek help or assistance for specific highly complex procedures.\nThe Airway Triage App can also be used for prospective airway management studies. A direct link with description of your airway plan and an audit of adverse events can be emailed that will be used to validate this innovative triage tool. The Airway Triage App is developed by the founder of the Airway Management Academy.\nUse this airway assessment tool and please provide feedback to improve global patient safety during airway management.\nThis app is available in 10 languages, the default language is English."

You are the one who can create this invaluable health record most efficiently.\n\nThe daily results of entries are displayed on a dashboard and on an easy-to-read graph with which you can interact.\n\nIt takes a few minutes to make your entries to a Mood Vue questionnaire and seconds later you get your results.\n\nMood Vue assesses how you rate yourself on a questionnaire covering a wide range of mood symptoms. It then calculates a score for depression, anxiety, elation, mixed mood state and emotional reactivity.\n\nYou can also log your thoughts for each day. This helps you see that what you are thinking may be upsetting your mood. Being aware of your thoughts is often the first step in tackling faulty thinking.\n\nAlong with your results, there is a brief commentary explaining their significance and highlighting some symptoms you may need to attend to.\n\nSharing your results with your doctor and therapist gives them a better understanding of the extent and variations of your symptoms and this is fundamental to have the best treatment plan.\n\nThe daily scores on the graph make it easy to track the progress of your recovery.\nOnly you have access to and control of the data you enter and the results that are generated. Mood Vue does not retain any personal information.\n\nIt is important to remember that Mood Vue does not diagnose depression or bipolar moods. It can track the symptoms of these moods and score their severity. It is only a doctor, after a full assessment, who can make these diagnoses.\n\nIt is recommended that you check out any mood symptoms you may have with your doctor before using Mood Vue, as general medical conditions can have symptoms similar to those of depression and bipolar, such as tiredness, lack of enthusiasm, poor concentration, difficulty sleeping and change of appetite for food.\n\nMood Vue allows you to gather up all the main symptoms of the 5 mood states and make clinical sense of them. Then, this can help you and your doctor to both shorten the time to recovery and keep relapse to a minimum.\n\nSECURITY\nMood Vue does not retain any personal information, there is no login facility, there are no registered users and emails are not retained. Details you provide at the time of purchase of Mood Vue app. are not transmitted to the developer Redgen. Redgen staff cannot see your entries to Mood Vue unless you choose to email them to us.\n\nMOOD VUE STANDARDS\nMood Vue is a clinically validated medical device. It has been designated as a Class 1 medical by Health Product Regulatory Authority of Ireland and is in conformity with the Essential Requirements of Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC.

      "label": "****Thank you for making us a TOP 25 App in US, UK and Canada App Store category specific rankings!****\n\nSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a kind of depression that appears at certain times of the year. Light therapy is one of the potential treatments for this condition. Almost 80% of the people who try light therapy find it beneficial. This app converts your apple device into a light box.\n\nWhy you SHOULD NOT download this App:\n1. If you are looking for a SAD Light Box App that generates an intensity of 10,000 Lux\n2. If you are looking for a quick fix and can not commit to consistent morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks\n3. If you will get turned off by the simplicity of this app and the solution to Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nWhy you SHOULD download this App:\n1. If you want to try a cheap yet effective alternative to a traditional Light box which uses lower intensity BLUE LIGHT (approx. 100 to 575 Lux) and is backed by research (Google research paper: The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in sub-syndromal seasonal affective disorder by NCBI, US National Library of Medicine)\n2. If you would rather be intelligent and try something for a fiver rather than spend a few hundred dollars on a conventional light box\n3. If you are able to consistently commit to regular morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks \n4. If you would be happy with a REALLY SIMPLE APP that transforms your Apple device into a Light box and is more portable and user friendly\n5. If the weather is making you sad :( and you would rather be happy :)\n     \nThis app can also help you:\n1. Determine if you are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/ Cabin Fever/ Winter Blues/ Seasonal Depression with help of a short scored test\n2. Create your own unique shade of Blue / White / any other color light that works best for you\n3. Use the app as a Dawn Simulator (set alarm)\n4. Set timer for your light box to time your morning exposure sessions\n5. Shop for other products to help with SAD\n6. Listen to the Radio in the background\n\nUV Rating: The UV emission from your Apple Device is 0, hence this app does not have a UV rating. \n\nSome other activities you might want to try to deal with symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder are:\n• End your morning shower with a cold shower\n• Try to arrange the spaces you spend time in to maximize sunlight exposure\n• Keep curtains open during the day\n• Trim tree branches or hedges that may be blocking some of the light from getting into your home\n• Move furniture so that you sit near a window or, if you exercise indoors, set up your exercise equipment by a window\n• Install skylights and add lamps\n• Build physical activity into your lifestyle preferably before SAD symptoms take hold. Physical activity relieves stress, builds energy and increases both your physical and mental well-being and resilience\n• Make a habit of taking a daily noon-hour walk, particularly if you commute to school or work in the dark hours of the day\n• Meditate at least 20 min a day (focus on your breathing)\n• Try High intensity training if you are fit enough and have less time\n• Maintain good sleep hygiene\n• When all else fails, try a winter vacation in sunny climates—if the pocket and work schedule allow. Keep in mind that the symptoms will recur after you return home\n\nREFUND POLICY: If you consistently use the App for 14 days and show us that you genuinely tried but did not get any results, WE WILL REFUND 100% OF YOUR MONEY. *Subject to terms and conditions of Apple Inc. and the Apple App Store.\n\nSmile, because somewhere far away, we are cheering for you :)\n\n*THIS APP MUST NOT BE USED TO SUBSTITUTE ANY MEDICATION/ MEDICAL DEVICE. THE CREATORS/ PUBLISHERS OF THIS APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING AS A USE OF THIS APP. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES. NO PART OF THIS DESCRIPTION OR APP MUST BE CONSIDERED AS MEDICAL ADVICE*"

If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected.

The method has been used in more than 30 international clinical studies in the past 20 years. \n\nIt gives you the ability to assess and quantify your tremor and to keep track of your values. You can upload your results as Text Files to your iCloud Drive for further visualization, or to share and import them to personal EHR apps. \n\nFor more information, visit www.studymyhealth.com\n\nTremor is the notion for the trembling of a limb. Most prominent is the trembling of the outstretched hand, that everyone is aware of in special situations like excitement or strenuous workouts. Whereas a light trembling of the hand is present in all humans, increased amplitude of the trembling can lead to serious problems in daily life. Increased trembling could be a symptom of a wide variety of diseases, as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor disease, hypothyroidism, or various psychiatric conditions.\n\nTHIS APP IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, OR CURE ANY DISEASE.\n\nNote: Tremor severity and frequency are not supported by iHealth; as soon as these values are available we will connect the App to the iHealth ecosystem. \n\niPad Users: Note that the App is not working on the iPad; it does NOT make sense to measure hand tremor using an iPad, the device is too large and heavy to perform the measurements."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "StudyMyTremor let you record, analyze, and track the trembling of your hand, the so-called \"Tremor\". \n\nThis app uses a highly sophisticated, scientifically proven method to measure, analyze and track humand hand Tremors. The method has been used in more than 30 international clinical studies in the past 20 years. \n\nIt gives you the ability to assess and quantify your tremor and to keep track of your values. You can upload your results as Text Files to your iCloud Drive for further visualization, or to share and import them to personal EHR apps. \n\nFor more information, visit www.studymyhealth.com\n\nTremor is the notion for the trembling of a limb. Most prominent is the trembling of the outstretched hand, that everyone is aware of in special situations like excitement or strenuous workouts. Whereas a light trembling of the hand is present in all humans, increased amplitude of the trembling can lead to serious problems in daily life. Increased trembling could be a symptom of a wide variety of diseases, as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor disease, hypothyroidism, or various psychiatric conditions.\n\nTHIS APP IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, OR CURE ANY DISEASE.\n\nNote: Tremor severity and frequency are not supported by iHealth; as soon as these values are available we will connect the App to the iHealth ecosystem. \n\niPad Users: Note that the App is not working on the iPad; it does NOT make sense to measure hand tremor using an iPad, the device is too large and heavy to perform the measurements."

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

This app does not replace the original manuscript of these landmark critical care trials – instead, it serves as a fast reference and learning tool for some of the most important ICU trials over a wide range of specialties.\n\nEach entry contains a short one-liner about the critical care trial and key points, which includes only the most pertinent details, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, treatment protocols, pertinent endpoints and findings, as well as expert commentary regarding key subgroup analyses or limitations to the trial.\n\nWant to send a colleague a citation? Use the \"Share Trial\" button to send a PubMed link and quick summary. Using this feature, it’s incredibly easy to share pivotal critical care trials with students, residents, and other colleagues.\n\nThe database features 150+ landmark trials related to: ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT/PE, delirium, glycemic control, heart failure, hemorrhage, meningitis, nephroprotection, nutrition, pneumonia, sedation, seizure, sepsis/shock, spinal cord injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage – with more trials and topics to be added on a regular basis!\n\nThis app is designed and maintained by Sean P. Kane, PharmD, BCPS -- a clinical pharmacist specializing in critical care with a background in information technology and application development."

The videos and information are all accessed from within the app with no connection to the internet required. \n \n(*Internet access is required for links accessed from within the app and tertiary video content.)\n\nA unique system that combines live sonoanatomy via ultrasound scans, 3D animated anatomy and real time video of the performance of regional anaesthetic nerve blocks. All elements are combined and synchronised with audible narration.\n\n* Full length offline demonstrations of many regional anaesthetic techniques.\n\n* Insertion of a Pajunk E-Cath (CPNB)\n\n* A video guide to the Pajunk E-Cath, including setting up of the system, insertion and fixation.\n\n* 3D Animated anatomical models, interlinked with live ultrasound scans.\n\n* Synchronised (US and camera) nerve mapping scans.\n\n* Visualise a whole block from start to finish.\n\n* Clear narration during the procedure.\n\n* A source of tips and advice which we wished had been around when we started using ultrasound. \n\n* Easy accessed tabs for Anatomy, Procedure and Tips.\n\n* Stunning full screen diagrams.\n\n* Annotated ultrasound screen shots.\n\n* Fantastic for the novice or experienced anaesthesia provider.\n\n* Learning tool for ODP’s, ODA’s, Anaesthetic nurses, PA(A)’s, AA’s, CRNA’s and all staff working within regional anaesthesia.\n\n* Medical students can gain a better insight into regional anaesthesia.\n\nA tab system gives the user access to anatomy, procedure, tips and equipment. The anatomy tab gives an overview of anatomy related to the specific block, it includes schematic diagram’s which can be expanded to full screen. The procedures tab is a full pictorial and text guide to the performance of the specific block, including annotated ultrasound screen captures to help visualise nerves. The tips tab contains useful advice related to the selected block, also included is advice on the use of ultrasound and local anaesthetics.\n\nA must have app for both junior and senior anaesthetic staff as well as practitioners working within regional anaesthesia.\n\nThe blocks are:\n\nInterscalene & Mapping\nSupraclavicular & Mapping\nInfraclavicular\nAxillary x 2 & Mapping\nRadial Nerve & Mapping\nMedian Nerve & Mapping\nUlnar Nerve & Mapping\nTAP\nFemoral Nerve & CPNB\nSaphenous Nerve\nPopliteal Sciatic\nPECS1\nPECS2\nPECS1 and 2 combined\nSerratus anterior\n\nDedicated nerve mapping videos now make orientating yourself with anatomy even easier. Using demonstrator video interlinked with annotated live ultrasound scanning can help you to locate and track nerves and other relevant anatomy. (The nerve mapping videos will be available as online content to cut down on the size of the app, an internet connection will be required to access these.)More blocks will be added to this app, contact us to let us know what you would like to see in future updates.\n\nwww.raguru.com\n\nThis App is exactly what it says it is - it’s a guide. It doesn’t set out to replace a standard text book. It certainly isn’t a substitute for a sound knowledge of anatomy and local anaesthetic pharmacology. It’s more of a guide to the occasional blocker, a refresher to the more experienced, and a teaching aid to the trainer. \n\nWe are a busy hospital with a heavy teaching commitment. Therefore we choose to use nerve stimulation in conjunction with ultrasound as we feel it adds another layer of safety to the patient, and reassurance to the operator."

Wherever you are within the allied health professions - medical school, nursing school, NP school, PA school, residency, and beyond - you can improve your knowledge base in the short and long term with these key associative memory aids.\n\nMedical Mnemonics puts 1796 clever acronyms, rhymes, and memory tricks on your iPhone or iPod Touch, covering topics ranging from Anatomy and Biochemistry to Pharmacology and Surgery.\n\nThe database is fully searchable and can be quickly filtered by discipline and by system. Create a Favorites list, and search and filter it similarly.\n\nThe best mnemonics can be those you make yourself. Add your own mnemonics to the database, where they'll appear seamlessly alongside those which come with the program.  Submit them instantaneously to the Medical Mnemonics server for review by an MD (that's me!) and inclusion in the next version.\n\nYou can email any mnemonic to a colleague from within Medical Mnemonics. He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human.

The Cry Translator will tell you. Click “…More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n- Awarded Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n\n-  I love it ! A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

Also, a quick reference to those acronyms like OQPRST and DCAP/BTLS. \n\n• NREMT-P Recertification - This tells you what you need to do to recert (number of hours, categories, etc.) \n\n• START Triage Quiz - Another bonus quiz covering the START system \n\n• Hazmat Response Quiz - Another bonus quiz on how to deal with hazmat incidents (for EMS personnel) \n\nNOTE: If you think you've found a typo or inaccurate question, please report this immediately and we will investigate. All known problems will be immediately corrected. We update our software frequently so you can rest assured that quality is the number one concern! Remember, this is a study guide, not a reference book. The purpose is to help you learn and remember, it is not a substitute for an instructor."

      "label": "Cognitive Bias Modification allows individuals to improve their unconscious decision making processes. The CBM Helper tool has been designed to give people the opportunity to apply this methodology in an easy to use way.\n\nHow To Use The App\n\nWhen a user presses the PLAY button they are presented with a grid of images, their task is to identify and touch the most positive image as quickly as possible. They are then presented with a new set of images and the process repeats until the timer expires.\n\nThe application will allow the user to alter their natural bias and look for more favourable outcomes.\n\nCognitive Bias Modification (CBM) helps patients to make better choices at an unconscious level by increasing their ability to automatically identify a more positive outcome. By continual practice over time the patient becomes more predisposed to finding the good things in life rather than searching out negativity.\n\nJust as when we buy a new car and subsequently see everyone driving them, a persons brain is wired to look for a particular set of stimuli. For example, people who are highly negative and suffering from stress are often looking for the worst case scenario or 'catastrophizing'; these individuals are constantly watching for, and processing possible instigators of disaster.\n\nCBM works by having the patient consciously look for the positives, to find the silver lining in the clouds, in a controlled manner. Over time this help realign the unconscious processes along more positive and productive lines, and eventually will allow the patient to automatically evaluate situations with greater balance.\n\nCognitive Bias Modification has been found to be an effective exercise for individuals suffering from anxiety based disorders such as Stress, Depression and PTSD."

If you exercise that rate should increase to an elevated rate. yourPulse lets you find your heart rate and keep track of what your heart rate is at different conditions. Say you are just resting, take your heart rate. Go for a run and then take your heart rate. The next time you run, take your heart rate and compare to see if you did as much work. yourPulse will give you your maximum heart rate (based on your age) and then will give you your target rates for your fitness level. Keep track of your beat. \n\nTaking your heart rate is simple with yourPulse. First find your pulse.  Push the \"Start counting pulse button\" and start to count your pulse. Push the \"Stop counting button\" when you are ready. Move the slider over to how many beats you felt. It will then give your heart rate, max rate and targets (for when exercising). Lastly if you want, enter any comments about that rate and click the \"Add to History\" button. You can then go to the history window and review your heart rate history.\n\nClick on the profile tab to enter your age, and fitness level. This will customize your heart rate max and targets.\n\nIf you want to know more about how to find your pulse, click on the \"How to\" tab for instructions on how to read your pulse.\nThis app integrates with the Health app via HealthKit to save your pulse to Health App.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any feedback (web@lajdesignsw.com).

      "label": "This is the successor the the popular, award-winning, best selling, doctor recommended pain tracking app, My Pain Diary: Chronic Pain & Symptom Tracker.\n\nThis version, My Pain Diary: GOLD EDITION, strikes a delicate balance between ease-of-use and a broad feature-set. This is a truly USEFUL app, and the newest member of the My Pain Diary family, which has helped over 90,000 chronic pain sufferers better manage their pain, improve communication with their doctors, and gain insights that would be hard attain through other means.\n\nUseful and popular features include automatic weather fetching, iCloud sync, basic medication tracking, photo attachments, graphs and PDF doctor's reports.\n\nThis app is highly customizable. Everyone tracks pain differently, and this is a framework that supports just about any tracking strategy.\n\nCreated by a chronic pain patient to track, manage, and report on chronic pain and symptoms, chronic illness, and mental health.\n\nThat means there is no big company with deep pockets supporting this project. I am just one man with a chronic pain condition, a demanding day job, and a young family to care for. I just happen to be formally trained in design, self-taught in programming, experienced at marketing and customer relations, and am a chronic pain patient myself. That's a very rare combination of traits that is hard to come by, so I'm making the most of it, and holding my own against the big players.\n\nEnough about me, back to the app!\n\nFeatures:\n+   iCloud Sync Support\n+   Universal App\n+   Highly Customizable\n+   Easy to use \n+   Track unlimited conditions\n+   Track multiple/unlimited times per day\n+   Add past entries (change entry timestamp)\n+   Edit past entries\n\nANATOMY OF A PAIN DIARY ENTRY\n\nTRACKERS: Trackers can be thought of as labels or folders that categorize and differentiate your entries. These are the key to tracking more than one condition and comparing conditions to each other.\n\nA common strategy is to name the Trackers after the diseases/conditions that you will be tracking. I.e. Migraines, Anxiety, Fibromyalgia, etc. These are just examples. \n\nMETRICS: Each entry is composed of one or more optional pieces of information called 'Metrics'. For example, two commonly used metrics are 'Pain Intensity' and 'Pain Duration'. Metrics are associated with and shared amongst your Trackers. This means that you can set it up to use different metrics for different Trackers, keeping your entry pages clean and the cognitive load low.\n\n -- MEDICATION TRACKING --\n+   Basic medication tracking.\n\n -- IMPORTANT EVENTS --\n+   Record important events that aren't suited for a Pain Diary entry. i.e. Medical Procedures, Therapy Sessions, A slip and fall, etc.\n\n -- HISTORY --\n+    Color-Coded Calendar - Spot patterns and trends at a glance. Calendar days are colored based on the day's highest recorded Intensity.\n+   Fully searchable.\n+   Day View\n\n -- GRAPHS --\n+   Visualize and compare intensity over time with this interactive graph. Plot and compare up to 3 'Trackables' at once and one optional Weather Metric.\n+   Email, print and share a PDF of the Graph.\n\n -- REPORTS --\n+   Create a PDF Report for your Doctors or for archival purposes. Share the Report via email and other standard methods.\n+   Include Graph\n+   Include Pain Scale Descriptions\n+   Include Color-Coded-Calendar\n+   Include Medication Log\n+   Include Important Events\n\n -- TOOLS --\n+   Automatic Weather Fetching\n+   Pain Scale Editor\n+   Units preference - US/Imperial or XUS/Metric\n\n\nWant to see the app in action?

      "label": "NEWS2 Calculator is designed to make it easier for healthcare professionals to calculate NEWS or NEWS2 scores during the assessment of acute illnesses in patients.\n\nThe NEWS and NEWS2 are scoring systems which use six physiological parameters, which are recorded in routine practice, to give an aggregate score which can be used to determine the best response for acutely ill patients. The six parameters are:\n- Respiratory rate\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Systolic blood pressure\n- Pulse rate\n- Level of consciousness\n- Temperature\n\nA score is allocated to each parameter during measurement. A larger score means the parameter varies more from normal levels.\n\nNEWS2 Calculator has options to colour code the controls based on their value (for example, when changing the value of a parameter which would give a score of 3, the control turns red). The colours are based upon the NEWS2 chart which healthcare workers are already familiar with, making NEWS2 Calculator extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThere is also an option for alerts to appear which provide further guidance for healthcare workers on the best course of action to take, based upon the NEWS or NEWS2 score which was calculated.\n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application has been designed to assist pre-hospital, community and hospital clinicians to calculate a National Early Warning Score for patients who are unwell.

A major advantage of using real teeth is that many show interesting and unusual features, which would be seen on dental patients. These can be explored and are explained through an interactive guide."

Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data.

      "label": "epTools is a platform for the evaluation of heart rhythm disorders. It is a universal app running on iPhone and iPad devices. \n\nResources include algorithms commonly used to localize arrhythmia substrates and reference guides to assist in the identification of clinical conditions involving abnormalities of cardiac rhythm. Algorithms are implemented via an intuitive user interface. These algorithms guide the user through a series of questions to arrive at an answer while providing a graphical visualization of their progress and result of their analysis.  \n\nUse of the save path to image feature allows users to save an image of the current decision path when using many of the decision analysis tools included. These images, which appear in the photo album, may be useful to communicate findings with colleagues. \n\nUsers may access scientific reference material cited in the app.  Many of the references are available for free or are easily accessible by subscription holders.  \n\nLocalize accessory pathways using algorithms of Arruda, Milstein, Taguchi , D'Avila, Li, Pambrun, Baek and Crionon et al and differentiate WPW from FVF using O'Leary et al.\n\nLocalization of atrial tachycardias: Algorithms provided (based on Ellenbogen et al and Kistler et al) assist in the localization of ATs from 12-lead electrocardiogram. The De Ponti et al tool calculates the appropriate mapping window to identify the isthmus of an AT. The Miyazaki et al tool localizes macro reentrant ATs based on pacing responses.\n\nTools to assist with diagnosis of preexcitation variants, J-wave syndromes and entrainment site localization are included.\n\nLocalization of ischemic ventricular tachycardia: Three algorithms are provided (based on Miller et al, Segal et al and Andreu et al) to assist in the localization of exit sites for ventricular tachycardia in the setting of single and multiple myocardial infarction based on findings on 12-lead electrocardiograms during ventricular tachycardia. \n\nLocalization of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular contractions via ECG findings:  The Ito,Park  and Enriquez et al algorithms assist in the localization of ventricular ectopic activity and tachycardia. 8 tools are provided to differentiate right from left ventricular (aortic cusp) outflow tract arrhythmias via calculation of the QRS-RVA Interval the  V₂S/V₃R Index, TZ Index, V₂ Transition ratio and the R/S-wave Amplitude, R-Wave Duration, R-wave amplitude, V₂QRSI40  and RV₁-₃ indices.\n\n2 tools are provided to differentiate endocardial from epicardial VTs (calculation of the MDI, Daniels et al and the Berruezo criteria).\n\nDisease Assessment: Consensus criteria for ARVD/C and Short QT Syndrome.  5-yr risk of SCD in HCM (O'Mahon et al)and LQTS (1-2-3-LQTS-Risk), inadequate DFT safety margin (Hsu et al ), LA arrhythmogenic substrate (Kosiuk et al, D'Ambrosio et al), 30-day mortality after PPM and ICD lead extraction (Brunner et al), 1-4 year mortality in  1° prevention ICD placement (Bilchick et al, SHOCKED), Shanghai score (Brugada Syndrome),  VT prediction in ARVD/C (Cadrin-Tourigny et al.), Suspicious Index In Lyme Carditis (SILC), PADIT infection and ABC-VT Risk Score calculators are provided.\n\nA CIED/electrocautery manager is included. Detailed preoperative plans can be created and shared by text or email.\n\nA clinical guidelines and consensus statement resource is provided.\n \nTools to differentiate SVT from VT using  12-lead electrocardiogram features utilizing the Brugada, Verckei and Moccetti et al algorithms.\n\nTools for CHADS₂, CHA₂DS₂VASc  and ATRIA stroke risk, HAS-BLED bleeding risk scores, QT correction heart rate (Bazett or Fredericia, Hodges) and left bundle branch block (Bogosian and Yankelson et al)  and a CL to bpm interconverter are provided. \n\nReference examples using the included tools are available on our website (www.busy-being-born.com/examples)."

Weight estimates can provide helpful guidance during a mother's pregnancy and can also be used to help diagnose other potential issues.\n\nUsers provide the abdominal circumference (AC) as well as one or more of the following: biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL) and head circumference (HC). The app then uses one of the standard fetal weight estimation algorithms (Shepard or Hadlock) to provide the estimate.\n\nIf the estimated fetal age is available, the app can also provide a growth percentile based on either the Hadlock growth curve or the World Health Organization growth curve."

      "label": "Instant Z-Scores For All The Paediatric Cardiology Parameters You Review Everyday.\n\nCardio Z has been developed by the experienced Paediatric Cardiology team at Evelina Children's Hospital, London, UK in collaboration with the technology company UBQO. The application makes it easy to calculate Z-scores and centiles for the many cardiac and paediatric measurements that are made in normal clinical practice. Cardio Z distils a wealth of clinical research parameters into a single accessible format.\n\nZ–scores and centiles are a means of expressing how far a measurement is above (positive Z-score) or below (negative Z-score) the average for the size or age of a patient. They are particularly important in assessing and monitoring growing patients, from fetal life though to adulthood.\n\nHealth professionals need to be able to access the normal ranges for cardiac parameters at every age and size, and cross-checking of measurements can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Cardio Z will prove invaluable for both clinicians working directly in Paediatric Cardiology, and those who work in other fields of Paediatrics.\n\nCardio Z allows users to access Z-scores without the need for an internet connection, or the requirement to input the same data in multiple calculators. Users can define their own settings so that they can be sure that their use of z-scores is consistent over time, whilst still allowing flexibility for the experienced clinician. Comprehensive guidance is available ensuring that measurements are consistent with those of the original research, allowing valid comparisons.\n\nCardio-Z creates a summary of all z-scores for each patient, which can then be saved, e-mailed or printed. Simple, reliable and time-saving.\n\nFULL LIST OF FEATURES:\n\n- Cardio Z allows calculation of z-scores of:\n- Height, weight, BMI and head circumference\n- Clinic blood pressure, with calculation of a user-defined 'target centile' blood pressure\n- Echocardiographic measurements of most cardiac structures, including valves, chambers, vessels and coronary arteries\n- Fetal echocardiographic measurements, using gestational age, femur length or biparietal diameter as size reference\n- M-mode echocardiography, including TAPSE\n- Pulsed wave velocities, including E/E' ratio and E/A ratio\n- Tissue Doppler velocities and time intervals. Including Isovolumetric Contraction Time (IVCT), Isovolumetric Relaxation Time (IVRT), Ejection Time and Myocardial Performance Index\n- Discriminant scores for neonatal aortic stenosis with borderline left ventricle\n- ECG parameters (2nd and 98th centiles) and corrected QT interval calculation\n\nEXTRA FEATURES:\n\n- Guidance tips for measurements, including diagrams and notes of the methods of the original researchers\n- Centiles, as well as z-scores, displayed for all parameters\n- No need to re-enter height and weight: baseline data only needs to be entered once\n- Generation of a .pdf summary which can be saved, e-mailed or printed\n- Saved patient Z-score summaries can be accessed and edited at a later date\n- Short-cut keys for frequently used parameters\n- Body surface area calculator can be defined to use the same algorithms as the original research\n- Cardio Z reduces the inconvenience of making Z-score calculations, and improves the correct application of this important clinical tool. The App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions.  \n\nWe hope you enjoy using Cardio Z!"

If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected.

It’s all about tackling the mindset shifts you need to establish a healthier relationship with food and your body—a tactic that is often neglected with other weight loss methods.\n\nThis is not a diet. Diets can feel restrictive and don’t address the root issues, which often are the result of unhealthy relationships with food or exercise that were formed long ago. Instead, hypnosis for weight loss is a practice that reprograms the way you think about food so that you naturally develop healthier habits for the long term.\n\nThere is a reason why Rachael's apps have been downloaded millions of times, because they work.\n\nBenefits can include:\n- Faster weight loss\n- Increased body image confidence\n- Healthier habits for natural weight loss\n- Increase energy\n- Deeper relaxation\n- Improved sleep\n- Increased motivation\n- Focus\n \nThis app features: \n\n* Soothing, therapeutic hypnotherapy tracks designed by Rachael Meddows\n* High quality, state of the art recordings\n* Playlist feature you can customize with in-app purchases\n* Optional hypnosis instructions\n* Choose a short, long, or sleep induction\n* Your choice of eight different background sounds"

Covering over 80 muscles with more than 150 trigger points.\n\nMyofascial trigger points are one of the most common sources of pain, and are often overlooked by health professionals. \n\nThis app strives to help you find the source of pain via intuitive interface: tap the body where your pain is and see which trigger points refer pain to that area. Over 50 distinct pain areas are covered.\n\nYou can also find trigger points by by tapping a muscle on the muscle model, by choosing a muscle from the alphabetized list, or by using the search bar. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, you can search using keywords such as \"elbow\", which will show the muscles of the elbow as well as any pain areas or conditions related to the elbow (e.g. \"lateral elbow pain\", \"tennis elbow\").\n\nTrigger points can cause or mimic a variety of conditions such as \"Tendinitis\" and \"Tennis Elbow\". More than 40 conditions are covered. Choose a condition and see a list of muscles whose trigger points can cause or mimic that condition.\n\nIn each trigger point illustration, an \"x\" marks the location of the point, while the area of referred pain is colored in blue.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this app does not include treatment information; its aim is to help find the source of specific pain. Once you've identified a trigger point please consult a massage therapist or otherwise trained professional. There are also myriad self-treatment resources available both in book and video format should you choose to treat yourself.\n\n4520c652df"

The only limitations in this light version are the inability to save data and the possibility to download drug records from the central internet drug database, you can however list the drug records in this database. It will display the interaction between Propofol and Remifentanil and has the powerful IVassist mode that will translate,with adjustable precision, a specific blood or effect site concentration to a bolus and series of infusions. It will show totals of each infusion segment with or without bolus or time to run so you can program your infusion pump for when a segment is ending and a change in infusion rate is required. The IVassist mode can easily be mixed with the manual mode so you will not lose the connection between the dose and the running simulation in case you need a quick bolus. In addition Target controlled infusion can be simulated in blood and effect mode so you can explain your lesser pharmacokinetic grounded colleagues the pharmacokinetic principles of these modern infusion devices.\nThere is another 'light' version of TivatrainerX for the combination of Propofol Fentanyl: TivatrainerP-F in the App Store"

      "label": "A mobile device-based Patient Care Report app. PCR EMS lets first responders record patient information at the scene in a fast, secure way on your iPhone or iPad. Don't lose information by writing it on your glove or on a piece of paper! The menus are designed in the order in which information is normally entered, and any submenu can be used without being dependent on another submenu. For example, you could enter the patient's chief complaint, age, and name  from the Dispatcher before you reach the scene, then fill in the rest of the patient information a t the scene. Or enter Vitals before doing the subjective interview.\n\n Dozens of features, including:\n\n  * stand-alone: no other app or Internet required\n  * multiple pcrs\n  * data and date pickers for most fields eliminate typing errors\n  * full ambulance information including: unit, mileage, times at various locations\n  * full patient bio and insurance information\n  * multiple vitals including: blood pressure, pulse, respiration, blood glucose, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), responsiveness.\n  * full subjective (SAMPLE history)\n  * full objective (primary and secondary assessment)\n     - primary assessment: general impression, airway, breathing, circulation, rapid scan, priority\n        of care and transport.\n     - secondary assessment: breathing, circulation, airway, detailed menus for each body part.\n  * multiple interventions (medications and procedures)\n    - pre-filled menus for medications and procedures\n    - medication and procedure lists can be modified within the app\n  * a chronology of all actions taken\n  * a self-generating narrative\n  * capture and print patient signatures for: accept privacy practices , accept treatment, refuse treatment, accept transport, refuse transport\n  * print detailed screens for key data\n  * enter multiple notes for the patient\n  * and, of course, a printed PCR.\n\nIn addition to actual use in a patient-care environment, PCR EMS is a great tool for field-training officers to teach EMTs how to write a PCR.  It can also be used as an education aid to present scenarios for studying for exams such as the NREMT.\n\nFor the Notes feature, you might imagine the following scenarios: a  paramedic returning from a call fills the ambulance gas tank and makes a note of the mileage, cost, and gallons; an EMT on patient intake notes that a 14 year old girl was not accompanied by a parent or guardian but determines that she is a emancipated minor; a field training officer notes the performance of a trainee at every step in the examination. All these and many more possible with Notes!\n\nPCR EMS keeps all data on the iPhone. This eliminates the problem with other ePCR systems of being dependent on the Internet and thus being inoperable in regions without a strong cell signal.\n\nPCR EMS also recognizes that large differences may exist on the content and format of patient care reports in different regions and systems.  Therefore, the printed report incorporates the basic information and does not attempt to format the report. But the report can be printed on any AirPrint-compatible printer."

      "label": "Homeorep is an advanced and flexible homeopathic software for the repertorisation of symptoms. It has been developed for the demanding homeopaths who need a tool capable of helping them solve the ever different clinical cases encountered in daily practice. The symptoms can be repertorised according to the so called Boenninghausen's Method (with polarities and contraindications). The original Therapeutic Pocket Book is the core of the database. It can be edited. Users can enrich it by the addition of their own rubrics, define their own list of active remedies and even build up their own repertory. A patient record system allows clinical data and repertorisations to be saved for each consultation.\n\n\nDATABASES\n\nThere are 4 tables of rubrics:\n• Boenninghausen's THERAPEUTISCHES TASCHENBUCH (original german 1846)\n• Boenninghausen's THERAPEUTIC POCKETBOOK (english translation 1847, entirely revised and corrected)\n• Boenninghausen's MANUEL DE THERAPEUTIQUE HOMEOPATHIQUE (french new translation by Michel Ramillon © 2013-2021)\n=> It is the same repertory of rubrics in 3 different languages. “The Sides of the Body and Drug Affinities 1853” also by C. von Boenninghausen was appended.\n• PERSO is an initially empty table where users can build up a hierarchy of rubrics in the form BOOKS > CHAPTERS > RUBRICS > REMEDIES. Overtime each user will incorporate their own rubrics which they deem helpful to their personal practise.\n\nThere are 3 built-in lists of remedies:\n• Boenninghausen (125 remedies)\n• Hering (421 remedies)\n• Extended (800+ remedies).\n=> If one of these lists is defined as active, repertorisations will take into account only the remedies of this list. Each list is editable. They can be restored to their original state if necessary.\n\n\nBOENNINGHAUSEN’S METHOD\n\n• Boenninghausen’s method is actually Samuel Hahnemann’s inductive method carried to its highest point.\n• The recomposition of a complete symptom through the combination of only 3 rubrics: Localisation + Sensation + Modality, gives already a first selection of possibly indicated remedies as a consequence of the underlying probabilistic structure of this unique repertory, which was ahead of its time and is still modern nowadays where the theory of probabilities and statistics has invaded almost all fields of sciences. Adding more (well selected) rubrics points out with increasing precision to the remedies which are the most likely indicated.\n\n\nREPERTORISATION\n\n• For each selection of rubrics Homeorep computes and sorts the remedy-columns of the evaluation grid according to a customizable sequence of priorities including: Grand Total, Number of Hits, Sum of Grades, Difference of Polarities.\n• The repertorisation does not discriminate between rubrics coming from the TPB or the Perso tables. All rubrics selected by users are listed in the Selection page where they can be managed indifferently (eliminatory rubrics, polar status, combination of rubrics, etc.) before displaying the result of the repertorisation in the Evaluation page. After combining (merging or crossing) several rubrics in the Selection page, the combined rubric can easily be copied and pasted into the Perso table.\n\n\nPATIENTS\n\n• A Patient Data Management System enables to save personal and clinical data for each consultation, including case taking, prescriptions and repertorisations. For each consultation several repertorisations can be saved. Each repertorisation includes the list of selected rubrics and/or an image of the evaluation grid. A saved list of rubrics can be at any time called back to the Selection page where it can be modified.\n\nUsing Homeorep for self-medication cannot be an alternative to the diagnosis and treatment provided by a registered Heath Care Professional. The developer of Homeorep disclaims all responsibility for all consequences of any person using Homeorep as a medical tool."

Peflog understands bronchodilatation and it creates comprehensive reports.\n\nI'm a father of four and found traditional PEF monitoring boring, time consuming and error prone. I tried to use pen and paper with my children but it didn't really work out. I creating snappy Peflog app for myself and for my children in order to make asthma tracking as easy and fast as possible for everybody.\n\nFeatures\n\n- Save Peak Flow readings with ease\n- Edit readings and monitoring periods\n- A timer reminds about the next puff after having medication\n- Comprehensive report and charts\n- Daily variation\n- Bronchodilatation (impact of the medication)\n- Reference PEF (calculated based on age, height and gender)\n- Personal best (calculated or manual)\n- Colour zones (green, yellow, red)\n- Alarming variations indicated in red\n- The PDF report is easy to send out\n- Dark and light themes and color options\n- Languages: English, Finnish, Norwegian, German, Spanish\n- Available for other platforms too\n\nIMPORTANT! This applications is not a medical device nor its substitute. You must use your own certified peak flow meter and consult a healthcare professional about its correct usage. This application provides information as is and should not be treated as a medical advice. You should always consult your healthcare professional in your health related issues and appropriate usage of the information.\n\nThank you for these kind words and five stars!\n\n*****Mar 8, 2019\nFor me is the best app for tracking my daughter's asthma. It's tell me when her asthma is going worst before she notice it. Very easy to use and you can send the peak flow chart directly to the doctor.\n\n*****Mar 4, 2019\nI'm completely satisfied with the app, I can store everything exactly as my doctor asks me. Top App.\n\n*****Feb 1, 2019 A Must Have Peak Flow App\nLove this app does what it says on the tin. Easy to use, so glad of this app, worth every penny. Nice one developer\n\n*****Dec 12, 2018 Simple to use\nTried a few apps before settling on this. Easy to use with nice, clear, graphs. Does all I need.\n\n*****Aug 11, 2018 Brilliant app and so easy to use\nI’ve tried a few asthma PEF diary apps and this is by far the best. Nice graphics, easy to use and easy to understand.\n\n*****May 5, 2018 Excellent for those under assessment\nI wanted an easy to use app that just plotted readings before and after meds and this fits the bill perfectly. It’s very easy to use and has room for notes if you want to add them. It’s much better than the basic sheet I was given by the nurse and shows up plainly how effective the meds are. Well worth paying for, thank you!"

Pinch to zoom in and out on the map.\n\nDermatomes is an essential reference for neurologists, emergency physicians, family doctors, medical students, physiotherapists, chiropractors, osteopaths and other medical professionals – or anyone curious about neuroanatomy and the workings of the human body.\n\nFeatured in Apple's 2010 essential apps for medical students.\n\nConsult a doctor if you are experiencing neurological symptoms. This app should not be relied upon to make clinical decisions, which remain the full responsibility of the user. Dermatomes are variable between individuals and the pattern of sensory loss is usually less than the entire dermatome, because of overlap. The map and landmarks  presented are a consensus view drawn from numerous sources.\n\nDermatomes comes with lifetime email support."

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We assume no liability for any personal harm or injury sustained as a result of using this application."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

      "label": "Blood calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis are important health issues. The consequences of abnormal levels are often life-changing and occasionally life-threatening. Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

Pinch to zoom in and out on the map.\n\nDermatomes is an essential reference for neurologists, emergency physicians, family doctors, medical students, physiotherapists, chiropractors, osteopaths and other medical professionals – or anyone curious about neuroanatomy and the workings of the human body.\n\nFeatured in Apple's 2010 essential apps for medical students.\n\nConsult a doctor if you are experiencing neurological symptoms. This app should not be relied upon to make clinical decisions, which remain the full responsibility of the user. Dermatomes are variable between individuals and the pattern of sensory loss is usually less than the entire dermatome, because of overlap. The map and landmarks  presented are a consensus view drawn from numerous sources.\n\nDermatomes comes with lifetime email support."

      "label": "Anyone who snores at night is usually exhausted and not well rested the next morning. But not only that, the (spouse) partner is also prevented from sleeping because of the noise. \n\nMost of the time you will be confronted with the words: \"I have to fall asleep before you, otherwise you will start snoring and I won't be able to sleep.\" \n\nSnoring can thus become a real test of patience and there are even said to be cases where partners are no longer (able to) sleep in the same room.\n\nAlthough the number of men who snore is higher, there are also many women who snore. Therefore, this problem affects all genders.\n\nThere are several possible remedies on the market. But not all of them deliver what they promise, are expensive or very unwieldy.\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is an anti-snoring solution that works through a completely \"natural\" concept. \n\nIn the past, did your partner, with a (gentle) nudge, make you change your sleeping position to stop snoring?\n\nThis practice is a common method between many couples in bed to stop the other from snoring. \n\nThis approach often serves its purpose. However, it is usually the case that both are awake at night and then have to fall asleep again. \n\nOur Anti-Snore-App automatically fulfills exactly this purpose without anyone having to wake up for it.  \n\nAfter a short orientation period, our Silent Night app promises you: \n\n- restful and regenerative sleep for everyone involved\n- reduced disturbance of the partner's rest\n- improved oxygen intake due to the shifting of the body\n\nOur app uses state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of machine learning. We use it to evaluate your current sleeping sounds and provide you with unconscious assistance through vibrations. \n\nOf course, your data remains completely recorded on the device and will be deleted immediately after evaluation. This means that not only your restful sleep but also the protection of your data is in the forefront.\n\nLikewise, all processes operate directly on the device, data and radio connections can be independently deactivated by you (recommended!) overnight.\n\n----\nDisclaimer for medical services\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice and/or diagnoses. The Anti-Snore-App is not intended to diagnose or treat respiratory failure or other diseases/medical conditions. Please consult a licensed physician before making any decisions or taking any actions that may affect your health, safety and well-being. Do not ignore professional advice based on things you have seen, heard or read on the app, website or social media. Always consult a healthcare professional if you have questions or concerns about your snoring or overall health."

An essential resource for medical and nursing staff of all levels. \n\nABOUT \n\nOver recent years it has become increasingly important to follow evidence based guidelines and practice in neonatal care. The range and complexity of drug and infusion calculations has increased making it difficult for the clinician. The NicuApp makes it easy to make rapid and accurate calculations without distracting from the direct care of the infant. \n\nCalculation of drug and infusion doses can be time consuming and complex. The NicuApp allows users to define their own patient parameters with calculations being based on gestation, age and weight. This not only saves time, but ensures accuracy, thereby reducing the risk of drug error. \n\nThe NicuApp allows physicians and nurses to rapidly look up evidence based guidelines relevant to the care of infants. The management of a specific condition, an explanation of how to carry out a practical procedure or reference ranges for biophysical parameters. All this information is available by the cot side without the need for an internet connection. \n\nThe NicuApp makes it easy to reference suggested neonatal guidelines; calculate drug and infusion doses; along with procedural and physiological parameter calculations. A comprehensive handheld tool for medical and nursing staff of all levels. \n\nThe App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions."

The app will remind you to take your daily dose at a personally configurable time.\n \nTap on your daily dose to confirm you've taken the blood thinner medication. The timestamp of confirmation is stored in the app. That way, you'll never forget if and at what time you've taken your medication.\n \nThe app can also record the INR measurements of your blood and visualizes the evolution of your INR in time. The app also reminds you when a new INR measurement is planned.\n\nDose and INR data can be exported or imported for backup purposes, or if you want to discuss this with your medical expert."

Other fantastic features include:\r\n\r\n* No subscription required and once the app is downloaded no internet connection is needed\r\n* A full glossary of abbreviations\r\n* Timing functionality tailored to individual stations\r\n* 50 original scenarios covering the breadth of the examination, with more being added all the time.\r\n* Full support from the ReviseAid team.\r\n\r\nThe app is designed as an aide memoir while seeing patients on the wards prior to your exam. It is best used in pairs; one candidate holds the app while the other is examined. For stations 1,3 & 5 there is information on the things to look out for in the examination, an example presentation and a comprehensive list of facts for questioning. Stations 2 & 4 facilitate role play as each candidate has differing information pages. In order to mirror the exam there are timers for each scenario to help you get up to speed.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!"

Strengthening this essential skill can improve reading, concentration, memory, attention to detail, and speed of processing. \n\nTWO POWERFUL MODES help brain injury and stroke survivors with left neglect improve at home while also helping occupational therapy (OT) and speech therapy (SLP) professionals to efficiently assess for right or left neglect and provide more effective treatment.\n\n* Use the Test mode to determine if and where a visual attention deficit exists.\n* Use the Practice mode to train scanning by finding targets in order.\n\n++ SEE HOW IT CAN HELP – Download Visual Attention Therapy Lite for FREE! ++\n\n-----------\n\nCANCELLATION TASKS JUST GOT BETTER. This professional cognitive training app takes a familiar format for treating left neglect and transforms it into a dynamic, interactive tool for all ages. Visual Attention Therapy offers benefits that can only be achieved through technology: \n\n* Targets must be tapped from left to right, top to bottom in Practice mode, which trains users to slow down and scan the entire screen before they move on.\n* Immediate feedback with visual and auditory cues keeps users engaged.\n* Timed exercises increase motivation to work quickly and accurately.\n* Stop wasting time counting errors! Automated scoring includes data for accuracy by quadrant, time for completion, and mistakes in professional e-mailed reports.\n* Adjustable layouts and 10 levels of difficulty allow you to customize the experience to meet changing needs or multiple users.\n* Sidebar signal can flash in a variety of colors to draw attention to the left or right.\n* An endless variety of combinations eliminates the need to photocopy exercises, with the option to print screenshots when you need a traditional exercise.\n* Use only one target to focus on scanning, or use two targets at once to challenge users with working memory and alternating attention deficits. \n\n-----------\n\nRACE AGAINST THE CLOCK to improve scores while improving cognitive and reading skills. Levels featuring letters can support literacy goals, while symbol-based levels challenge visual memory skills. It’s an occupational therapy dream come true!\n\nVisual Attention Therapy was developed by a certified Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) and is used worldwide in speech and occupational therapy (OT) to help adults with left neglect after stroke and brain injury. It is also used with children with dyslexia and attentional deficits by reading specialists and neuropsychologists.\n\nDON’T JUST TELL YOUR PATIENTS TO LOOK TO THE LEFT – TRAIN THEM. Modernize your occupational therapy or speech therapy exercises with a left neglect training tool that improves stroke and brain injury rehab. \n\nDOWNLOAD IT NOW!\n\n-----------\n\nLooking for something different in a stroke therapy app?

Hill's carrier phrase facilitation drills.  \n\nThis is the original Australian version of the application, with all audio and video recorded by the Australian speech pathologist Carol Bishop. The voice is suitable for countries like Great Britain but for speakers with an American accent we recommend the US version instead.\n\nThis application shows how to produce speech sounds and words and encourages speech, even in people with severe speech difficulties. This easy to use iPad application contains over 500 videos, sound clips and colour photos designed to help adults and children to produce the consonant speech sounds in isolation, in words and in sentences. Now includes recording, playback, rhyming words and randomisation. \n\nThis software is especially helpful to those who need to hear and see a sound made, for example, patients with motor speech difficulty due to speech apraxia (verbal or oral apraxia affecting speech). \n\nProvides multimedia full-motion video cues, for independent speech practice. Cues are for individual phonemes (sounds) as well as full words. \n\nEach exercise targets one word, divided into 20 consonant \npositions. For each exercise it provides: \n\n* Color photo \n* Auditory and written trigger phrase \n* Written word \n* Video clip of a speaker \n* Records and plays back patient's voice with model sound for comparison. \n\nThis app enables intensive independent practice for Motor Speech Disorders, with immediate auditory feedback."

The movement of the human eye is one of the most complex actions in the body, with multiple muscles working in conjunction to make the eye rotate. With EOM Sim, you can observe and control each of these muscles individually and learn how each of them affects eye movement. Useful as both a teaching tool and a study tool, EOM Sim is designed to help medical students (or anyone who is curious about how their eyes work) learn about eye movement using a 3D simulation rather than text.\n\nNow in Version 2: Pupillary response and fully 3D eye muscle rendering!\n\nHow To Use:\nSimply touch the screen and the eyes will follow your finger. Use the sliders on the side of the screen to weaken individual muscles and simulate different conditions. By swiping left or right, you can find toggles to disable different cranial nerves. To access the pupil mode, use the flashlight button on the bottom. \nTo view the 3D eye model, use the leftmost button on the bottom bar. You can rotate and zoom in this mode, and you can control where the eyes look using the joystick controller to the right. You can also interact with individual muscles to further see how each works.\n\nEOM Sim is still in active development, and we are always looking for feedback and suggestions!\n\nContact:\ngamesupport@westernu.edu"

Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat Ulcers (Peptic Ulcer). If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!\n\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\n\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question about suitability of various food items for your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\n\n• Health issues often come our way in groups of two or more. They are often caused by other health complications or result in other illnesses and risks. It is for that reason, that we have included separate guidelines for those who might be at risk with any of the following common conditions along with Ulcers: Anemia (iron deficiency), Cancer risk, Depression, Diabetes, Excess body weight or Obesity, High blood pressure, High cholesterol, Menopause, Stress, and Vitamin D deficiency.\n\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\n\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Also included are suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\n\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \n\nSuggestions presented in this app are based on the content licensed from Personal Remedies, LLC. The primary sources used by Personal Remedies are US government sources such as USDA (US Department of Agriculture), NIH (National Institute of Health) agencies, and leading clinics & universities.\n\nPersonal Remedies is the publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions in the market. It is based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\n\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads.\n\n“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\n\n “Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\n\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA"

In their study (Medani et al., 2018) showed that in only 34% of cases, the ECG Chest Leads were placed correctly.\n \nAll medical personnel who are operating a 12 Lead ECG machine should have the appropriate training for ECG lead placement (Kligfield et al., 2007; Crawford and Doherty, 2010). The purpose of 3D ECG Leads is not aimed at replacing high-quality training but instead, to act as an aid and to show you in a simple 3D interactive way the Standard Lead Placement Technique.\n \nAN ECG LEADS VISUALISATION TOOL\n \nIn a standard 12 Lead ECG Tracing, not all of the ECG Leads are organized in anatomical order. One recent study (Lindow et al., 2019) highlights the fact that displaying all the 12 ECG Leads in an anatomical sequence has a positive impact in diagnosing Acute Myocardial Infarction. 3D ECG Leads serves as a 3D interactive tool for the anatomical visualization of the ECG Leads. \n  \nWHY ONLY 10 LEADS. HOW AN ECG LEAD IS GENERATED.\n \nWith 3D ECG Leads you can visualize how the ECG Machine reads the heart's electrical activity, and how 3 Electrodes are generating 6 Leads.\n\nReferences \n\nCrawford, J. and Doherty, L.

      "label": "****Thank you for making us a TOP 25 App in US, UK and Canada App Store category specific rankings!****\n\nSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a kind of depression that appears at certain times of the year. Light therapy is one of the potential treatments for this condition. Almost 80% of the people who try light therapy find it beneficial. This app converts your apple device into a light box.\n\nWhy you SHOULD NOT download this App:\n1. If you are looking for a SAD Light Box App that generates an intensity of 10,000 Lux\n2. If you are looking for a quick fix and can not commit to consistent morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks\n3. If you will get turned off by the simplicity of this app and the solution to Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nWhy you SHOULD download this App:\n1. If you want to try a cheap yet effective alternative to a traditional Light box which uses lower intensity BLUE LIGHT (approx. 100 to 575 Lux) and is backed by research (Google research paper: The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in sub-syndromal seasonal affective disorder by NCBI, US National Library of Medicine)\n2. If you would rather be intelligent and try something for a fiver rather than spend a few hundred dollars on a conventional light box\n3. If you are able to consistently commit to regular morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks \n4. If you would be happy with a REALLY SIMPLE APP that transforms your Apple device into a Light box and is more portable and user friendly\n5. If the weather is making you sad :( and you would rather be happy :)\n     \nThis app can also help you:\n1. Determine if you are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/ Cabin Fever/ Winter Blues/ Seasonal Depression with help of a short scored test\n2. Create your own unique shade of Blue / White / any other color light that works best for you\n3. Use the app as a Dawn Simulator (set alarm)\n4. Set timer for your light box to time your morning exposure sessions\n5. Shop for other products to help with SAD\n6. Listen to the Radio in the background\n\nUV Rating: The UV emission from your Apple Device is 0, hence this app does not have a UV rating. \n\nSome other activities you might want to try to deal with symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder are:\n• End your morning shower with a cold shower\n• Try to arrange the spaces you spend time in to maximize sunlight exposure\n• Keep curtains open during the day\n• Trim tree branches or hedges that may be blocking some of the light from getting into your home\n• Move furniture so that you sit near a window or, if you exercise indoors, set up your exercise equipment by a window\n• Install skylights and add lamps\n• Build physical activity into your lifestyle preferably before SAD symptoms take hold. Physical activity relieves stress, builds energy and increases both your physical and mental well-being and resilience\n• Make a habit of taking a daily noon-hour walk, particularly if you commute to school or work in the dark hours of the day\n• Meditate at least 20 min a day (focus on your breathing)\n• Try High intensity training if you are fit enough and have less time\n• Maintain good sleep hygiene\n• When all else fails, try a winter vacation in sunny climates—if the pocket and work schedule allow. Keep in mind that the symptoms will recur after you return home\n\nREFUND POLICY: If you consistently use the App for 14 days and show us that you genuinely tried but did not get any results, WE WILL REFUND 100% OF YOUR MONEY. *Subject to terms and conditions of Apple Inc. and the Apple App Store.\n\nSmile, because somewhere far away, we are cheering for you :)\n\n*THIS APP MUST NOT BE USED TO SUBSTITUTE ANY MEDICATION/ MEDICAL DEVICE. THE CREATORS/ PUBLISHERS OF THIS APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING AS A USE OF THIS APP. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES. NO PART OF THIS DESCRIPTION OR APP MUST BE CONSIDERED AS MEDICAL ADVICE*"

This app does not replace the original manuscript of these landmark critical care trials – instead, it serves as a fast reference and learning tool for some of the most important ICU trials over a wide range of specialties.\n\nEach entry contains a short one-liner about the critical care trial and key points, which includes only the most pertinent details, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, treatment protocols, pertinent endpoints and findings, as well as expert commentary regarding key subgroup analyses or limitations to the trial.\n\nWant to send a colleague a citation? Use the \"Share Trial\" button to send a PubMed link and quick summary. Using this feature, it’s incredibly easy to share pivotal critical care trials with students, residents, and other colleagues.\n\nThe database features 150+ landmark trials related to: ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT/PE, delirium, glycemic control, heart failure, hemorrhage, meningitis, nephroprotection, nutrition, pneumonia, sedation, seizure, sepsis/shock, spinal cord injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage – with more trials and topics to be added on a regular basis!\n\nThis app is designed and maintained by Sean P. Kane, PharmD, BCPS -- a clinical pharmacist specializing in critical care with a background in information technology and application development."

The concentrations in the suspensions and critical care sections can edited and concentrations stored for future use. The default units for each data item can be set to match you needs.\n\nWhy is Dose Chex required? Errors in the administration of medications are commonplace and can result in significant harm to patients. The 2009 NPSA report ‘Safety in Doses’ identified 72,482 medication incident reports in one year. Of these 100 had resulted in death or severe harm. In addition, such errors can have a significant effect on the person administering the medication\n\nIn acute care settings there can be many distractions, making it difficult to concentrate on the often complex calculations required when administering medicines. Removing as many potential points of human error helps make the process safer."

      "label": "* The world's number 1 DAF app is used by thousands of people in over one hundred countries. *\n\nDAF Professional has been created to help people who stammer or have a neurological disease such as Parkinson's Disease. It helps people to slow their rate of speech which makes it clearer to others.\n\nDAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.\n\nDAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT). DAF Professional delivers incredibly low latency feedback even when running in the background.\n\nDelayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly. However, until recently, devices have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used.\n\nDAF was originally developed for people who stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010).\n\nIt works by enabling someone to hear his or her own speech in an altered manner. This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups however DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions.\n\nWhen using Bluetooth devices there is an additional delay of 60ms added to the feedback system.\n\nIf you do use a Bluetooth headset you may find you need to turn the bluetooth device on after opening the app to enable it.\n\nDAF Professional works when put in the background or the screen is turned off. Like all apps of this type, it can NOT work during phone calls or with other media apps playing at the same time.\n\nIf you wish to provide any feedback we would be delighted to hear from you. Please email us at support@speechtools.co.\n\nOur lead Speech and Language Therapist is Samantha Brady who qualified as a Speech and Language Therapist in 2001 (PGDip, City University) and gained her Masters in Speech and Language Therapy in 2006 (MSc, City University). She has a wealth of experience of working as a Speech and Language Therapist in a variety of settings and her area of clinical expertise is adult neurology and voice. Samantha is a member of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT), HPC Registered (SL10250) and Lee Silverman Voice Treatment Certified (LSVT).\n\nDAF Professional is fully GDPR compliant and will not collect any of your data without first asking for your consent."

A major advantage of using real teeth is that many show interesting and unusual features, which would be seen on dental patients. These can be explored and are explained through an interactive guide."

      "label": "SleepCheck is more than a sleep or snore recorder, it assesses your risk of sleep apnoea by analysing your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. \n\n**Why should I take the test?**\nSleep apnoea (or apnea) is a serious medical condition that can have a major impact on your life. If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected. No account setup required. - \n\nYour sleep recording never leaves your iPhone. Once analysed, it is deleted. \n\nYour age, gender, sleep duration and risk assessment will be collected by ResApp Health and used to improve our products and services. This will not include any data that will identify you. To find out more, please read our privacy policy.\n\nFor use on adults aged 18 years and above.\n\nAlways read and follow the Instructions before Use.

      "label": "This is the successor the the popular, award-winning, best selling, doctor recommended pain tracking app, My Pain Diary: Chronic Pain & Symptom Tracker.\n\nThis version, My Pain Diary: GOLD EDITION, strikes a delicate balance between ease-of-use and a broad feature-set. This is a truly USEFUL app, and the newest member of the My Pain Diary family, which has helped over 90,000 chronic pain sufferers better manage their pain, improve communication with their doctors, and gain insights that would be hard attain through other means.\n\nUseful and popular features include automatic weather fetching, iCloud sync, basic medication tracking, photo attachments, graphs and PDF doctor's reports.\n\nThis app is highly customizable. Everyone tracks pain differently, and this is a framework that supports just about any tracking strategy.\n\nCreated by a chronic pain patient to track, manage, and report on chronic pain and symptoms, chronic illness, and mental health.\n\nThat means there is no big company with deep pockets supporting this project. I am just one man with a chronic pain condition, a demanding day job, and a young family to care for. I just happen to be formally trained in design, self-taught in programming, experienced at marketing and customer relations, and am a chronic pain patient myself. That's a very rare combination of traits that is hard to come by, so I'm making the most of it, and holding my own against the big players.\n\nEnough about me, back to the app!\n\nFeatures:\n+   iCloud Sync Support\n+   Universal App\n+   Highly Customizable\n+   Easy to use \n+   Track unlimited conditions\n+   Track multiple/unlimited times per day\n+   Add past entries (change entry timestamp)\n+   Edit past entries\n\nANATOMY OF A PAIN DIARY ENTRY\n\nTRACKERS: Trackers can be thought of as labels or folders that categorize and differentiate your entries. These are the key to tracking more than one condition and comparing conditions to each other.\n\nA common strategy is to name the Trackers after the diseases/conditions that you will be tracking. I.e. Migraines, Anxiety, Fibromyalgia, etc. These are just examples. \n\nMETRICS: Each entry is composed of one or more optional pieces of information called 'Metrics'. For example, two commonly used metrics are 'Pain Intensity' and 'Pain Duration'. Metrics are associated with and shared amongst your Trackers. This means that you can set it up to use different metrics for different Trackers, keeping your entry pages clean and the cognitive load low.\n\n -- MEDICATION TRACKING --\n+   Basic medication tracking.\n\n -- IMPORTANT EVENTS --\n+   Record important events that aren't suited for a Pain Diary entry. i.e. Medical Procedures, Therapy Sessions, A slip and fall, etc.\n\n -- HISTORY --\n+    Color-Coded Calendar - Spot patterns and trends at a glance. Calendar days are colored based on the day's highest recorded Intensity.\n+   Fully searchable.\n+   Day View\n\n -- GRAPHS --\n+   Visualize and compare intensity over time with this interactive graph. Plot and compare up to 3 'Trackables' at once and one optional Weather Metric.\n+   Email, print and share a PDF of the Graph.\n\n -- REPORTS --\n+   Create a PDF Report for your Doctors or for archival purposes. Share the Report via email and other standard methods.\n+   Include Graph\n+   Include Pain Scale Descriptions\n+   Include Color-Coded-Calendar\n+   Include Medication Log\n+   Include Important Events\n\n -- TOOLS --\n+   Automatic Weather Fetching\n+   Pain Scale Editor\n+   Units preference - US/Imperial or XUS/Metric\n\n\nWant to see the app in action?

      "label": "NEWS2 Calculator is designed to make it easier for healthcare professionals to calculate NEWS or NEWS2 scores during the assessment of acute illnesses in patients.\n\nThe NEWS and NEWS2 are scoring systems which use six physiological parameters, which are recorded in routine practice, to give an aggregate score which can be used to determine the best response for acutely ill patients. The six parameters are:\n- Respiratory rate\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Systolic blood pressure\n- Pulse rate\n- Level of consciousness\n- Temperature\n\nA score is allocated to each parameter during measurement. A larger score means the parameter varies more from normal levels.\n\nNEWS2 Calculator has options to colour code the controls based on their value (for example, when changing the value of a parameter which would give a score of 3, the control turns red). The colours are based upon the NEWS2 chart which healthcare workers are already familiar with, making NEWS2 Calculator extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThere is also an option for alerts to appear which provide further guidance for healthcare workers on the best course of action to take, based upon the NEWS or NEWS2 score which was calculated.\n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application has been designed to assist pre-hospital, community and hospital clinicians to calculate a National Early Warning Score for patients who are unwell.

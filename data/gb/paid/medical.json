      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected.

      "label": "Instant Z-Scores For All The Paediatric Cardiology Parameters You Review Everyday.\n\nCardio Z has been developed by the experienced Paediatric Cardiology team at Evelina Children's Hospital, London, UK in collaboration with the technology company UBQO. The application makes it easy to calculate Z-scores and centiles for the many cardiac and paediatric measurements that are made in normal clinical practice. Cardio Z distils a wealth of clinical research parameters into a single accessible format.\n\nZ–scores and centiles are a means of expressing how far a measurement is above (positive Z-score) or below (negative Z-score) the average for the size or age of a patient. They are particularly important in assessing and monitoring growing patients, from fetal life though to adulthood.\n\nHealth professionals need to be able to access the normal ranges for cardiac parameters at every age and size, and cross-checking of measurements can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Cardio Z will prove invaluable for both clinicians working directly in Paediatric Cardiology, and those who work in other fields of Paediatrics.\n\nCardio Z allows users to access Z-scores without the need for an internet connection, or the requirement to input the same data in multiple calculators. Users can define their own settings so that they can be sure that their use of z-scores is consistent over time, whilst still allowing flexibility for the experienced clinician. Comprehensive guidance is available ensuring that measurements are consistent with those of the original research, allowing valid comparisons.\n\nCardio-Z creates a summary of all z-scores for each patient, which can then be saved, e-mailed or printed. Simple, reliable and time-saving.\n\nFULL LIST OF FEATURES:\n\n- Cardio Z allows calculation of z-scores of:\n- Height, weight, BMI and head circumference\n- Clinic blood pressure, with calculation of a user-defined 'target centile' blood pressure\n- Echocardiographic measurements of most cardiac structures, including valves, chambers, vessels and coronary arteries\n- Fetal echocardiographic measurements, using gestational age, femur length or biparietal diameter as size reference\n- M-mode echocardiography, including TAPSE\n- Pulsed wave velocities, including E/E' ratio and E/A ratio\n- Tissue Doppler velocities and time intervals. Including Isovolumetric Contraction Time (IVCT), Isovolumetric Relaxation Time (IVRT), Ejection Time and Myocardial Performance Index\n- Discriminant scores for neonatal aortic stenosis with borderline left ventricle\n- ECG parameters (2nd and 98th centiles) and corrected QT interval calculation\n\nEXTRA FEATURES:\n\n- Guidance tips for measurements, including diagrams and notes of the methods of the original researchers\n- Centiles, as well as z-scores, displayed for all parameters\n- No need to re-enter height and weight: baseline data only needs to be entered once\n- Generation of a .pdf summary which can be saved, e-mailed or printed\n- Saved patient Z-score summaries can be accessed and edited at a later date\n- Short-cut keys for frequently used parameters\n- Body surface area calculator can be defined to use the same algorithms as the original research\n- Cardio Z reduces the inconvenience of making Z-score calculations, and improves the correct application of this important clinical tool. The App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions.  \n\nWe hope you enjoy using Cardio Z!"

Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

      "label": "The purpose of this App is to accurately record the units you are consuming.  You do this by, at least, knowing the percentage alcohol and the amount of the drink - specified in ml, cl, litres, uk pints or US fl ozs.  Unlike other Apps it does not care what the drink is (e.g. a glass of wine or a pint of beer) just the units.  It does not judge you about the amount you are drinking it is trying to help you recognise how much you are drinking and manage that however you want.\n\nRecent changes have introduced the ability to mark a day as Alcohol Free, change the number of days used to calculate the rolling averages shown and, with this update, the ability to change the percentage alcohol and drink amount using the watch App rather than having to use the phone to make these changes.\n\nEver wondered how many units there are in a drink?  This App can can be used to just calculate the number of units in a drink but it can also be used to keep track of units consumed.  Just press the 'Add Units' button.  Until you ask yourself the question how many units am I consuming day by day, week by week and through the months you will have no idea.  Many people wildly underestimate the amount they drink.  This App can tell you and it can be very enlightening.  Unlike other Apps this one makes no judgement on how much you drink it is a means for you to understand the amounts and to act as you see fit.  If you choose to cut down then that is your choice.  Maybe this App will confirm that apart from the odd day or two you are generally within guidelines.  \n\nThis App is not restricted in the amounts that can be entered unlike other similar Apps.  The values are entered using a decimal number pad so you are not restricted by the values specified on picker wheels. You can enter ANY amounts using US fl Ozs, millilitres, centilitres, litres, UK pints.\n\nDrink Driving Limits: A 3.6% abv pint of beer has 2 units in it.  In the UK to remain within the drink drive limit you can have no more than 1 pint of weak (3.6%) beer - any more and you risk being over the drink drive limit.  Note, that the last sentence used the word 'weak', not one pint of beer but one pint of weak beer.  So what difference does that make?  Well a 5% beer has 2.84 units in it.  So, you're probably pushing the upper limit, if not already over it.\n\nLegal Disclaimer:  Do not use this App as a guide to whether you can drive a car or not.  This App is just for calculating and collating the number of units consumed.\n\nNow with Apple Watch support & iCloud Support to save your precious information. Easy to add the same units from your Apple Watch.  See how many units you've consumed today glancing at your Apple Watch. Save you units consumed to iCloud.  Retrieve them on another device."

The concentrations in the suspensions and critical care sections can edited and concentrations stored for future use. The default units for each data item can be set to match you needs.\n\nWhy is Dose Chex required? Errors in the administration of medications are commonplace and can result in significant harm to patients. The 2009 NPSA report ‘Safety in Doses’ identified 72,482 medication incident reports in one year. Of these 100 had resulted in death or severe harm. In addition, such errors can have a significant effect on the person administering the medication\n\nIn acute care settings there can be many distractions, making it difficult to concentrate on the often complex calculations required when administering medicines. Removing as many potential points of human error helps make the process safer."

The DST very effectively detects early dementia stages, and can reliably distinguish between the different dementia severity levels. It is therefore suitable for dementia screening, as well as for severity monitoring / therapy control over time.\n\nAdditional functions include:\n- a reminder to redo the test after 3-6 months, for medical monitoring \n- continued engagement for prevention, through regular Dementia News \n- tracking of the dementia risk over time, visualized in a graphic\n- option to e-mail and/or print the test results (e.g., for discussion with a physician) \n\nTo date, there is no effective treatment for advanced dementia stages. Therefore, effective screening is essential to begin treatment before the brain damages become irreversible. Because for early dementia stages, there are already effective treatment options that can significantly delay or even prevent the progression of the disease. \n\nWith special tests, dementia can be detected 18 years prior to the first symptoms. The Dementia Screening Test (DST) is the only such test which has been certified by Health Authorities as a Medical Device for dementia screening.\n\nThe good news is: for most people the test can give the all-clear!\n \nThe DST in short:\n- Easy to perform, also for medical laypersons.\n- Reliable: more than 96% sensitivity proven in clinical trials, probably the highest value worldwide for such tests.\n- Safe: no registration required, no storage of personal data, works without internet connection, no advertising.\n- Recognized as a medical device by Health Authorities.\n- Works with all dementia subtypes (Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, Lewy-body dementia, secondary dementia, hybrids / other forms).\n- Engaging: provides you with the latest research results on a regular basis, and reminds to retake the test regularly.\n- Documents changes in dementia risk over time.\n- Supports research and public awareness for dementia patients and relatives.\n\nTake the test now, and become a superager!"

      "label": "In cooperation with ophthalmologists with experience in successful amblyopic treatment, the first iPad App designed to assist in keeping vision acuity and assisting in amblyopic correction [Captain Lazy eye] has been created!\n\nThat overall out of 100 people there are 1 to 4 people who are amblyopic.\nThat in regions with poorer medical care that the rate is even higher!\n\nWe’ve invited a former Ophthalmology department director of both Changhua Christian Hospital and Chungshan Medical University in Taiwan, Dr. Sharon Chuang, for her career-spanning experience in successfully treating amblyopic children in order to design a software specially for assisting vision correction for these children.\n\nBetween the ages 3 to 8, it is the perfect time for treatment of amblyopia. After this golden period, nerves in the eye begin to mature, and correction thereafter becomes increasingly difficult. That’s why if there’s a history of severe nearsightedness or astigmatism, it’s best to bring your children to a physician to check his/her eyesight as soon as possible. \n\nCorrection of amblyopia usually involves tedious and repetitive coordinative exercise, such as navigating a maze on paper, drawing lines on paper, etc. The blandness of such exercises is the primary reason that children become resentful or even express refusal to cooperate in the treatment! \n\nThe App turns amblyopic correctional exercises into fun and interesting games, assisting them with fascinating themes like pirates and princesses, enticing the children to perform the necessary occlusion for the training and ultimately making real correctional progress.\n\n\nRecovery of vision from amblyopia does not happen overnight, nor is there a shortcut. This is precisely why active participation of those who need it is vital. \n\nFeature of Captain Lazy eye:\n1.It 's a labor of love in cooperation with doctors experienced in treatment of amblyopic specifically designed to help improve patient vision.\n2.Makes training into fun and interesting games, increasing willingness to participate in correction.\n3.Records the daily performed exercises and correctional results, providing a better picture for physicians and parents for assessment of progress.\n4.Puts training results into easily to view charts.\n5.Includes six categories of training, with enriched content that kids won’t get tired of easily.\n\n■The training exercises included in this software are:\n\n1.Rotating grating\nVision is stimulated by looking at objects through gratings of different thickness and spacing.\n\n2.Color-Light training\nThe various colors and shades stimulate the visual nerves.\n\n3.Eyeball muscle exercise\nThe frequent change of focal point gives eyeball muscles a workout.\n\n4..Hidden object recognition\nEyes get trained to recognize specific objects in a visually distractive background.\n\n5.Color sensitivity training\nThe recognition of a specific color from a selection of similarly shaded colors is trained.\n\n6. Eye-hand Coordination \nThis exercises combines spatial and visual acuity in training to control visual muscles.\n\nHurry and get your App on! Allow your children to do exercises that are good for the eyes in a home environment! It’s saves you time and money from having to go to a physician for treatment.\n\nImportant: \nThis software is meant to be used under the guidance of and regular return visits to your physician. You should also enter the results of periodic doctor visits into a function provided in the app for you to more easily track treatment progress.\n\nPromotion video URL:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfQXmc54KaA"

      "label": "Blood calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis are important health issues. The consequences of abnormal levels are often life-changing and occasionally life-threatening. Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

Covering over 80 muscles with more than 150 trigger points.\n\nMyofascial trigger points are one of the most common sources of pain, and are often overlooked by health professionals. \n\nThis app strives to help you find the source of pain via intuitive interface: tap the body where your pain is and see which trigger points refer pain to that area. Over 50 distinct pain areas are covered.\n\nYou can also find trigger points by by tapping a muscle on the muscle model, by choosing a muscle from the alphabetized list, or by using the search bar. If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, you can search using keywords such as \"elbow\", which will show the muscles of the elbow as well as any pain areas or conditions related to the elbow (e.g. \"lateral elbow pain\", \"tennis elbow\").\n\nTrigger points can cause or mimic a variety of conditions such as \"Tendinitis\" and \"Tennis Elbow\". More than 40 conditions are covered. Choose a condition and see a list of muscles whose trigger points can cause or mimic that condition.\n\nIn each trigger point illustration, an \"x\" marks the location of the point, while the area of referred pain is colored in blue.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this app does not include treatment information; its aim is to help find the source of specific pain. Once you've identified a trigger point please consult a massage therapist or otherwise trained professional. There are also myriad self-treatment resources available both in book and video format should you choose to treat yourself.\n\n4520c652df"

      "label": "Our premier Paramedic Tutor was written to help any paramedic improve their skills, knowledge, and ability in the field of paramedicine. It includes over 800 multiple choice questions, almost 600 flashcards, 28 scenarios, 24 medication calculations, and 47 ECG's!\n\nThis app was created by practicing paramedics who have direct experience providing patient care, teaching other paramedics, and taking high stakes exams like the NREMT-P (NRP). The goal of this app is to have a resource where paramedics can come to learn new information, review tricky material, or take a look at real life EKG’s. Paramedic Tutor comes with several ways to interact with the material to enhance learning. There are multiple choice questions, flashcards, scenarios, and an EKG quiz. Throughout the app, special attention has been paid to Airway, Cardiology, Pediatrics, OBGYN, and EKG’s. These are the areas that are tested most often on national exams, because these patient types can be rare. The questions are not designed to trick, but they are designed around the best answer. Whether you are brushing up on skills, taking the NREMT-P (NRP), or taking a job-placement exam, this app can help you. Enjoy!\n\nThis app has some features that we think are pretty cool:\n\nBookmarking:While taking a quiz or looking at flashcards, we offer the ability to bookmark a question or flashcard for later review. If you find that you are repeatedly missing a certain question or if you are unaware of the reason for an answer, you have the ability to bookmark the question and later review it for a more effective learning experience.\n\nExplanations: Learning is the end result that we hope to produce. To provide our students with an optimal learning experience, we provide detailed explanations for why certain answers are correct, as well as descriptions of why other answers are incorrect.\n\nDISCLAIMER:Unfortunately, we are not without our mistakes. While we promise to continually hone and refine the material in this app, there may still be errors. While in the field, you should rely on your training and on the protocols and procedures under which you work.\n\nWe hope that you enjoy the experience of the Paramedic Tutor. If you have material that you think would help others pass the NREMT-P (NRP) or excel on the job, our content writers are always willing to review any material. If you find an error, please contact us with your thoughts and we will certainly review it.\n\nPlease send any comments, thoughts, reviews, ideas, etc... to:\n\ninfo@code3apps.com\n\nThanks, and be safe out there."

      "label": "BiliMatic is a tool that makes it easy for healthcare professionals to compare a newborn's serum bilirubin levels with standardized reference ranges for a given patient's age and risk factors according to Clinical Practice Guidelines established by the American Academic of Pediatrics.\n\nBiliMatic makes it easy to determine hours from birth to lab draw (or users can input this directly), and allows users to easily convert between different units. It includes options for considering a patient's risk factors and gestational age at delivery.\n\nBiliMatic references the American Academy of Pediatric's 2004 Guidelines for Hyperbilirubinemia. Your patient's data is plotted directly onto the AAP's phototherapy reference nomogram, making it easier for you to visualize data. The nomogram is browsable, allowing you to read reference values for low/medium/high risk newborns with a touch of your finger. The Bhutani nomogram for designating risk of hyperbilirubinemia is also provided.\n\nBiliMatic's beautiful and simple-to-use interface is optimized for modern iOS and iPadOS devices. The app works in both Imperial (mg/dL) and SI (µmol/L) units, and will even remember your preference and adjust nomogram axes appropriately. Users have the option of calculating a neonate's age by dates, or they can input it directly.\n\nBiliMatic is a handy tool that's useful for many users, whether you're a paediatrician, family doctor, nurse, resident, or medical student! BiliMatic is intended for use by medical professionals. If you are a patient, consult your doctor or healthcare provider for medical advice."

After qualifying, he completed a placement at Hangzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China.\n\nHe taught at The London College of Traditional Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (LCTA), the largest institution dedicated to teaching Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in England, for ten years. He was a Senior Lecturer and a Clinical Supervisor on the BSc Acupuncture course. Paul has been involved in training literally hundreds of today’s acupuncturists and herbalists. He now teaches at The College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM) just off of Oxford Circus, and The City College of Acupuncture, just off of Old Street.\n\nPaul is the chief presenter on “How To Locate Acupuncture Points: The Definitive DVD”, and has been published in many magazines, such as Yoga Monthly, Lifescape, Natural Health, CAM Magazine, the Dragon’s Tale, and the Chinese Medicine Times.\n\nTessa Whittaker LicAc, MBAcC\n\nTessa originally worked with and rode horses. She was encouraged to study Chinese medicine by her Shiatsu teacher and came to LCTA to learn acupuncture. Throughout her time at the College, Tessa also learnt yoga and intuitive movement – a freedom of expression that is now part of her everyday life. She now works with the Parkinson’s Recovery Project using Yin Tuina and visualization techniques on unmedicated Parkinson patients. Her riding background has inspired her to explore the use of Chinese medicine in the equestrian field, particularly Five Element riding and training techniques.\n\nABOUT SILENCE SPEAKS LTD\n (Luis Melendez)\n\nLuis is an American citizen originally from New York City whose personal journey into mind-body exploration began in 2001 when he experienced spiritual healing for the first-time while living overseas in Northamptonshire, United Kingdom. The experience, which on the surface was very unassuming in terms of setting and administration, proved transformative resulting in the life-long pursuit of Self-knowledge including completion of two spiritually-orientated academic degrees with The University of Portsmouth (BScHons Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, 2010) and University of Northampton (MScHons Transpersonal Psychology and Consciousness Studies, 2017).\n\nhttp://www.acupunctureforme.co.uk\nhttp://www.hypnosisworks.nyc\nhttp://www.silencespeaks.co.uk"

Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, its symptoms and complications.\r\n\r\nRecent research shows that there are a number of nutrients and natural food items that play a significant role in dealing with NAFLD. If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!\r\n\r\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\r\n\r\n• Separate dietary guidance for NAFLD AND its combination with the following most likely health issues: diabetes type 2, excess weight or obesity, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, metabolic syndrome, PCOS, prediabetes and stress. \r\n\r\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question if a food of your choice is helpful or harmful to your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\r\n\r\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\r\n\r\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Over 850 natural food items and growing number of recipes are included. \r\n\r\n• Suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\r\n\r\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We don't just point you to a food group. We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \r\n\r\nThe primary sources used by this app are US government agencies such as USDA, NIH (National Institute of Health), PubMed, and leading clinics & universities.\r\n\r\nPersonal Remedies is the producer of the world's first e-dietitian and publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions. Based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\r\n\r\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads.\r\n\r\n“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \r\nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\r\n\r\n“Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\r\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\r\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\r\n\r\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\r\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \r\nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA"

This award winning program reliably analyzes and diagnoses your baby’s cry, then recommends helpful solutions – all in less than 5 seconds! Is your baby hungry, sleepy, annoyed, stressed or bored? The Cry Translator will tell you. Click “…More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n- Awarded Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n\n-  I love it ! A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

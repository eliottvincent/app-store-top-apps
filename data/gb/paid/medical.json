      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

      "label": "NEWS2 Calculator is designed to make it easier for healthcare professionals to calculate NEWS or NEWS2 scores during the assessment of acute illnesses in patients.\n\nThe NEWS and NEWS2 are scoring systems which use six physiological parameters, which are recorded in routine practice, to give an aggregate score which can be used to determine the best response for acutely ill patients. The six parameters are:\n- Respiratory rate\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Systolic blood pressure\n- Pulse rate\n- Level of consciousness\n- Temperature\n\nA score is allocated to each parameter during measurement. A larger score means the parameter varies more from normal levels.\n\nNEWS2 Calculator has options to colour code the controls based on their value (for example, when changing the value of a parameter which would give a score of 3, the control turns red). The colours are based upon the NEWS2 chart which healthcare workers are already familiar with, making NEWS2 Calculator extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThere is also an option for alerts to appear which provide further guidance for healthcare workers on the best course of action to take, based upon the NEWS or NEWS2 score which was calculated.\n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application has been designed to assist pre-hospital, community and hospital clinicians to calculate a National Early Warning Score for patients who are unwell.

A major advantage of using real teeth is that many show interesting and unusual features, which would be seen on dental patients. These can be explored and are explained through an interactive guide."

Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data.

No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

Every time you take a dose of your medication, add it to the Doses Taken page to get a complete diary of medication usage. The colour coding makes it simple to see if doses are being missed. You can also filter by medication to see just a list of those doses. Your health data is yours so you can export it to CSV at any time.\n\nPeakflow\nMuch like in Doses Taken, the peak flow diary is simple to use. When you take a measurement, add it to the tracker to get a full record of your peak flow measurements. Optionally, you can mark how you were feeling at the time to help you keep track of symptoms. You can choose to add your peak flow data to Apple Health. As with the Doses Taken, you can export your peak flow data to CSV at any time.\n\nAdd Reminders\nSet reminders in the app to send you notifications when it is time to take medications, do a peak flow reading or book an appointment to see the Doctor or Asthma Nurse. Set the reminders to repeat Daily, Weekly Monthly or just a one-off.\n\nMedications\nIn the Medications page, add all the medications you want to track. Add data like its name, the number of doses per day, type of medicine (Inhaler or Tablet), notes about it. If it's your rescue medication, you can choose to add it to Apple Health's Inhaler Usage section.\n\nCharts\nThe Charts page allows you to view your progress over time easily and intuitively. For each of the medicines that you are tracking, you can view the doses you have taken. The peak flow chart will help you see changes over time. If need you can export the underlying chart data as CSV.\n\nFeatures:\nTrack usage of multiple medications.\nTrack your peak flow.\nExport your data for use in other apps.\nSet reminders.\nView charts of your progress.\nTrack multiple people on one device.\nAdd measurement to Apple Health.\nLight and Dark Mode.\nAll backed up in iCloud."

In their study (Medani et al., 2018) showed that in only 34% of cases, the ECG Chest Leads were placed correctly.\n \nAll medical personnel who are operating a 12 Lead ECG machine should have the appropriate training for ECG lead placement (Kligfield et al., 2007; Crawford and Doherty, 2010). The purpose of 3D ECG Leads is not aimed at replacing high-quality training but instead, to act as an aid and to show you in a simple 3D interactive way the Standard Lead Placement Technique.\n \nAN ECG LEADS VISUALISATION TOOL\n \nIn a standard 12 Lead ECG Tracing, not all of the ECG Leads are organized in anatomical order. One recent study (Lindow et al., 2019) highlights the fact that displaying all the 12 ECG Leads in an anatomical sequence has a positive impact in diagnosing Acute Myocardial Infarction. 3D ECG Leads serves as a 3D interactive tool for the anatomical visualization of the ECG Leads. \n  \nWHY ONLY 10 LEADS. HOW AN ECG LEAD IS GENERATED.\n \nWith 3D ECG Leads you can visualize how the ECG Machine reads the heart's electrical activity, and how 3 Electrodes are generating 6 Leads.\n\nReferences \n\nCrawford, J. and Doherty, L.

We’ve been there;  At 3 AM, you don’t feel like going through a textbook or a long UpToDate article; you just want to get things done.\n\n\n**************** \nREVIEWS \n\n\"If you have ever needed a quick reference to learn on the fly or been stumped by a late night call while cross-covering and you are willing to spend a few dollars to avoid that feeling, you should consider this app.\"\n\niMedicalApps.com\n\n\n“It has all those handy little things that drug guides and medical references just don’t capture concisely.”\n“I would pay at least double the cost for this handy little reference.”\n\nDr Jessica Otte, drottematic blog\n\n**************** \n**************** \n\n\nAUDIENCE\njunior residents, interns and medical students\n\n\nINTRO\nIn medical school, we learn a lot about diseases and the basis for their management.  However, we are traditionally less exposed to apparently easy problems like pain, nausea or hypokalemia.  Quite often, those issues are brought to the attention of the nursing staff in the evening.  At that time, the treating team is away and you're on call, running all over the hospital.  \n\nMD on Call gives you tips on how to QUICKLY assess and manage (acutely) common problems so you can go on assessing the next patient, or to your room to get some well deserved sleep.  -- it is NOT meant to replace a textbook --\n \n\n\nFEATURES\nMD on call is divided into 5 main sections:\n\n• Issues •  26 frequent on call situations (including management of some specific conditions)\n\nAbdominal Pain*\nAcute Coronary Syndrome*\nAgitation / Violence\nAnaphylaxis\nBleeding\nBradycardia*\nChest Pain\nConstipation\nDeath (Pronouncing)\nDecreased LOC\nDysuria / UTI*\nDyspnea\nFever\nFebrile neutropenia\nHeadache\nHypertension\nHypotension\nInsomnia\nMeningitis\nNausea / Vomiting\nPain\nPalliation\nPneumonia\nSeizure\nTachycardia\nWound Dehiscence\nWound Infection\n\n• Labs •  Common electrolytes abnormalities (including management)\n\nHypo Ca, K, Mg, Na, PO4, glycemia\nHyper Ca, K, Na, glycemia\n\n• ECG •  Normal and abnormal ECG values, now with examples\n\n• Misc •  Suggestions on how to write orders for admission, \"comfort measures only\", \"on call\" notes, OR and procedure notes.  \nTransfusions:  general information and common reactions\nMisc:  CSF values, opioid conversion...\n\n• Lines and Tubes • How to manage common problems, such as a blocked NG tube.\n\n• Search •  Search using acronyms or keywords\n\n\n****************\n\nFeedback is more than welcome :  visit the website for more details\n\n**************** \n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis publication (application) is to be used as a guide only.

      "label": "The BPPV Self Help app developed by Today’s New Idea has been designed to assist sufferers of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) to undertake a programme of Brandt-Daroff exercises.\n\nThe Brandt-Daroff exercise programme is a highly successful treatment programme for sufferers of BPPV and is very easy to do at home. \n\nThe exercise programme is quite long, typically two weeks, and involves repeating a series of simple movements throughout the day.\n\nHowever, we have found that the repetitive nature of the exercises makes it very easy to loose track of where you are.\n\nThe BPPV Self Help app has been designed to help ensure that users assume the correct positions throughout each stage of each exercise, while also helping track the users progress over the course of the entire exercise programme.\n\nThe app provides the following features:\n* Motion detection to ensure you are in the correct position and orientation\n* Timer functionality to ensure you hold the position for the required amount of time\n* Visual and optional audio feedback telling you when to change position\n* Notification reminders for missed exercise sessions\n* Simple to understand graphs showing your progress to date\n* Total privacy - your information never leaves your phone\n\nWe developed this app to help one of our colleagues who suffered from BPPV and we hope you find it helpful too!\n\nPlease note: While this app will run on the larger versions of the iPad we do not recommend you use this for this exercise treatment due to it's large size and weight. The smaller iPad versions are manageable though you will probably require two hands to hold it.\n\nToday’s New Idea is a “not for profit” business which means all proceeds from the sale of this app go toward the development of this app and other apps we hope users will find educational or beneficial."

ClaroCom helps to replace speech for those with impairments in the production of spoken language. ClaroCom is suitable for children or adults with some or full literacy, and can assist users who have limited or no speech and language difficulties.\n\nPRODUCT FEATURES\n\n• Writing\nType into the Message Window using the on-screen keyboard. Press the Speak button to have text in the Message Window spoken. ClaroCom can also speak each word as it is typed or inserted into the Message Window.\nText in the Message Window is spoken using the human quality in-built voices.\nCommunicate remotely with ClaroCom Pro. Text in the Message Window can be sent by Message and Mail and sent to Facebook and Twitter, as well as copied into other apps.\nUse the built in Word Prediction and Phrase Prediction to speed up writing. \nCreate text using the phrase banks to find a phrase. ClaroCom is loaded with some standard phrases. More phrases can be added and history is stored of what is typed.\nRotate or flip the iOS device and ClaroCom Pro will shows only the message to be communicated in large text the correct way up, perfect when communicating privately. Tipping the iPhone or iPad back reverts the screen back to normal.\n**NEW** Link & chat to iOS device - connect your device to any other device that is also using ClaroCom Pro.  You can then chat between the devices using the text that you type or words or phrases that you select.  Requires bluetooth or Wi-Fi.\n\n• Word Prediction\nClaroCom has built in Word Prediction when typing into the Message Window. ClaroCom's Word Prediction takes account of word frequency and previous words. There is an initial Word Prediction list loaded on startup, and ClaroCom can learn new words as they are typed if desired. \n\n• Phrase Prediction\nUse Phrase Prediction when typing into the Message Window. The phrases are loaded from the contents of the visible categories and ClaroCom stores new phrases that are typed or added. The predicted phrases appear on a Phrase bar above the keyboard. Phrases can be easily searched for, and bulk phrases can be easily added.\nPrediction works with acronyms, so as 'awn' is typed, 'Are We Nearly There Yet?' appears instantly. This is a very fast way to build up and learn a collection of phrases.\nSpeak a predicted word or phrase immediately with a ‘touch and hold’ instead of composing into a message – another faster way to get speech out. \n\nA swipe brings up more phrases and words that can be easily scanned through. \n\nFlexible phrases include fillable prompts so ClaroCom will know, when the 'I would like ___' phrase is selected, that immediately the user will be asked for the word(s) to complete the phrase. \n\nWith ClaroCom Pro phrases and words can be easily imported from files to quickly build complex phrase vocabularies from existing text resources, including files transferred via iTunes.\n\n• Dictionary\nChoose from a range of Word Prediction dictionaries.\n\n• High-Quality Voices\nAlong with the iOS system voices, 2 high-quality Nuance Vocalizer voices are included:\n◆ Daniel - English (UK)\n◆ Serena - English (UK)\n\nThe voice can be made to speak faster or slower you suit your needs. The voice is installed within ClaroCom, so will work when not online and does not use up any expensive data allowance.\n\nAdditional Nuance Expressive and Acapela voices in other accents are available through in-app purchase in ClaroCom.\n\n• Font and Colour\nChange the font size, colour or use a more-readable font to maximise ease-of-reading, making ClaroCom easily adaptable to different users' needs.\n\n• Personalise information\nClaroCom can be personalised to suit your individual needs, basic personal information is easily added and will appear in Phrases. ClaroCom Pro can be personalised by setting your name, so many phrases will detect and use it, saving time. \n\nFor the latest news, tips and advice follow @ClaroComApp on Twitter."

      "label": "The way we think determines both how we feel and how we behave. The way we think about ourselves, other people and our place in the world has a direct influence on our emotional state and our behaviour. Consequently by changing the way we think we can positively influence our mood and how we respond to situations.  This is the premise behind Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which has become the most effective psychological treatment available for a range of emotional and behavioural problems including depression and anxiety. \n\nA thought diary is designed to help people record and change the thoughts that cause emotional and psychological distress. The Thought Diary Pro is the advanced version of the Thought Diary, and allows the  identification of thinking errors (also known as 'cognitive distortions'), and the the modification of our unhelpful thoughts into more productive ways of thinking. By challenging the thoughts and beliefs that cause discontentment, dissatisfaction and other emotional and behavioural distress, we can improve our mental health and can change the destructive or adverse behaviours we may engage in as a result of our negative thoughts. \n\nThought Diary Pro is designed to be the second step in changing our thinking patterns by helping individuals identify the thinking errors that they engage in, and thereby helping change these thoughts. The effect of modifying these thought can reduce the negative emotional and behavioural consequences of experiencing these negative thoughts. Similar to the Thought Diary, the Pro version was designed by an experienced clinical psychologist and CBT therapist who believed that these tools should be available in the most accessible form for individuals to use in today’s fast technological world. It can be used by people either in therapy as a useful adjunct to the treatment, and there is a feature that allows the Thought Diary to be emailed straight to their therapist. However, it can also be used by those individuals who are embarking on a self-guided course of CBT."

Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

The App was developed by experts and ensures that you exercise correctly.  \n\nUse the App as a motivation for making pelvic floor exercises an integral part of your daily life. It is your tool to have at hand at all times. Now, you can squeeze correctly – anytime and anywhere. \n\nWhy are pelvic floor exercises so important?\nPregnancy and birth strain the pelvic floor muscles that can also slacken with advancing age. Pelvic floor exercises are important, in order for you to rediscover your body and be able to do all the activities you were used to doing before getting pregnant. Many women experience difficulties holding in urine after giving birth, for example while running, jumping on a trampoline or when laughing, sneezing or coughing. It is scientifically proven that pelvic floor exercises have a significant effect on incontinence, both before, during and after pregnancy. But as with any training, it’s all about getting started as soon as possible and training both properly and regularly.  \n\nFunctions:\n\nThe app has several functions that ensure successful pelvic floor training. \n- Reminders\n- Photos\n- Videos with exercises \n- Sound files\n- ’My downloads’:Your downloaded videos and sound files, which you can also use offline.\n\nThe exercises are divided into three levels, ensuring that everyone can participate regardless of the individual level. \n1. Beginner\n2. Slightly experienced\n3. Very experienced\n\nDeveloped by experts\nThe App is developed by physiotherapist Ulla Due in cooperation with midwife PhD Sara Kindberg from GynZone."

He now teaches at The College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM) just off of Oxford Circus, and The City College of Acupuncture, just off of Old Street.\n\nPaul is the chief presenter on “How To Locate Acupuncture Points: The Definitive DVD”, and has been published in many magazines, such as Yoga Monthly, Lifescape, Natural Health, CAM Magazine, the Dragon’s Tale, and the Chinese Medicine Times.\n\nTessa Whittaker LicAc, MBAcC\n\nTessa originally worked with and rode horses. She was encouraged to study Chinese medicine by her Shiatsu teacher and came to LCTA to learn acupuncture. Throughout her time at the College, Tessa also learnt yoga and intuitive movement – a freedom of expression that is now part of her everyday life. She now works with the Parkinson’s Recovery Project using Yin Tuina and visualization techniques on unmedicated Parkinson patients. Her riding background has inspired her to explore the use of Chinese medicine in the equestrian field, particularly Five Element riding and training techniques.\n\nABOUT SILENCE SPEAKS LTD\n (Luis Melendez)\n\nLuis is an American citizen originally from New York City whose personal journey into mind-body exploration began in 2001 when he experienced spiritual healing for the first-time while living overseas in Northamptonshire, United Kingdom. The experience, which on the surface was very unassuming in terms of setting and administration, proved transformative resulting in the life-long pursuit of Self-knowledge including completion of two spiritually-orientated academic degrees with The University of Portsmouth (BScHons Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, 2010) and University of Northampton (MScHons Transpersonal Psychology and Consciousness Studies, 2017).\n\nhttp://www.acupunctureforme.co.uk\nhttp://www.hypnosisworks.nyc\nhttp://www.silencespeaks.co.uk"

      "label": "This App was designed specifically to help those in the medical field as well as individuals who deal with wounds on a daily basis. It is meant to replace the need for using unsanitary paper rulers and other unsanitary means of measuring the width, height, and depth of a wound on a patient or yourself. This saves you not only the cost of a separate measuring device each time a wound is measured, but also helps to reduce the chance of infection that can come from touching a measurement device to an open wound. \n\nWith the Wound Measurement App, you can measure a wound opening one-handed, reducing some of the problems that can come with measuring a wound in a difficult spot. Once the measurements are complete, a label with appear above the wound with the measurements and you can save a picture of both the measurements and the opening all at the same time, saving you time and effort. \n\nUsers now have the ability to add patient information to the label including Patient ID, Patient Name, and Wound Location. The date and time appear on the label automatically to help you keep track of when a measurement was taken.\n\nWe respect the privacy of our users and their patients. We cannot and will not access the camera or photos remotely. Please note that the app will need to be allowed to use your phone’s camera only to take the measurements, and it will need to be allowed to save a photo to the photos library. If you do not wish to keep a photo, you can always go to your photos library and delete anything you don't want to keep. We also don’t collect or ask for any information from the user, we feel that your apps and information belong to you, and that you should have complete control of your privacy.\n\nLike most people, we don’t like having to see adds all over the place, so we don’t use any adds in this app. \n\nFeatures List:\n-Simple to use, with easy access to instructions.\n-Easy, one-handed operation.\n-Augmented Reality, tested for accuracy.\n-Does not require internet or cellular connection to take measurements or save photos.\n-Sanitary - nothing touches the wound.\n-In poor lighting conditions, the flashlight can be turned on from within the App.\n-Allows you to track the healing process easily and visually through photos saved from the App.\n-Users can add information to the wound label (Patient ID, Patient Name, Wound Location).\n-Date and time now automatically appear on the wound label to help you keep track of the healing progress.\n-Light or Dark mode\n\nCompatible with iOS devices from iPhone 7 and up.\n\nFor the best results in Augmented Reality, keep the phone perpendicular to the surface you want to measure."

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

      "label": "Squeezy CF has been reviewed, supported and endorsed by the CF Trust.\n\nIt is recognised that one impact of the exercise recommendations and airway clearance techniques for individuals with Cystic Fibrosis is that the pelvic floor can be put under strain, leading to pelvic floor dysfunction such as stress incontinence. This can happen to men and women, although it is more common in women. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can help to prevent and treat these problems, reducing pelvic floor, bladder and bowel symptoms and supporting the active lifestyle that is important for general health.\n\nSqueezy CF has been designed by chartered physiotherapists specialising in Pelvic Health working in the NHS. It is suitable for everyone who wants to do pelvic floor muscle exercises (also called Kegel exercises). The app is particularly aimed at those who are seeing a specialist physiotherapist for problems connected to their bladder, bowels or pelvic floor muscles as it can be tailored to a specific exercise programme and set to remind you when to do your exercises. It is simple to use, discreet, informative and has helpful visual and audio prompts to support your exercise programme plus it maintains a record of the number of exercises you have completed.\n\nFeatures:\n • Apple Watch support! Be extra discrete, squeeze from your watch\n • Customisable exercise plan\n • “Professional mode” to help physiotherapists set detailed exercise plans for patients\n • Visual, and audio guides for exercises\n • Information and tips written by professional Pelvic Health physiotherapists\n • Track and monitor your progress\n • Write a short note after a completed exercise\n • Simple and clear interface"

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

      "label": "****Thank you for making us a TOP 25 App in US, UK and Canada App Store category specific rankings!****\n\nSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a kind of depression that appears at certain times of the year. Light therapy is one of the potential treatments for this condition. Almost 80% of the people who try light therapy find it beneficial. This app converts your apple device into a light box.\n\nWhy you SHOULD NOT download this App:\n1. If you are looking for a SAD Light Box App that generates an intensity of 10,000 Lux\n2. If you are looking for a quick fix and can not commit to consistent morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks\n3. If you will get turned off by the simplicity of this app and the solution to Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nWhy you SHOULD download this App:\n1. If you want to try a cheap yet effective alternative to a traditional Light box which uses lower intensity BLUE LIGHT (approx. 100 to 575 Lux) and is backed by research (Google research paper: The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in sub-syndromal seasonal affective disorder by NCBI, US National Library of Medicine)\n2. If you would rather be intelligent and try something for a fiver rather than spend a few hundred dollars on a conventional light box\n3. If you are able to consistently commit to regular morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks \n4. If you would be happy with a REALLY SIMPLE APP that transforms your Apple device into a Light box and is more portable and user friendly\n5. If the weather is making you sad :( and you would rather be happy :)\n     \nThis app can also help you:\n1. Determine if you are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/ Cabin Fever/ Winter Blues/ Seasonal Depression with help of a short scored test\n2. Create your own unique shade of Blue / White / any other color light that works best for you\n3. Use the app as a Dawn Simulator (set alarm)\n4. Set timer for your light box to time your morning exposure sessions\n5. Shop for other products to help with SAD\n6. Listen to the Radio in the background\n\nUV Rating: The UV emission from your Apple Device is 0, hence this app does not have a UV rating. \n\nSome other activities you might want to try to deal with symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder are:\n• End your morning shower with a cold shower\n• Try to arrange the spaces you spend time in to maximize sunlight exposure\n• Keep curtains open during the day\n• Trim tree branches or hedges that may be blocking some of the light from getting into your home\n• Move furniture so that you sit near a window or, if you exercise indoors, set up your exercise equipment by a window\n• Install skylights and add lamps\n• Build physical activity into your lifestyle preferably before SAD symptoms take hold. Physical activity relieves stress, builds energy and increases both your physical and mental well-being and resilience\n• Make a habit of taking a daily noon-hour walk, particularly if you commute to school or work in the dark hours of the day\n• Meditate at least 20 min a day (focus on your breathing)\n• Try High intensity training if you are fit enough and have less time\n• Maintain good sleep hygiene\n• When all else fails, try a winter vacation in sunny climates—if the pocket and work schedule allow. Keep in mind that the symptoms will recur after you return home\n\nREFUND POLICY: If you consistently use the App for 14 days and show us that you genuinely tried but did not get any results, WE WILL REFUND 100% OF YOUR MONEY. *Subject to terms and conditions of Apple Inc. and the Apple App Store.\n\nSmile, because somewhere far away, we are cheering for you :)\n\n*THIS APP MUST NOT BE USED TO SUBSTITUTE ANY MEDICATION/ MEDICAL DEVICE. THE CREATORS/ PUBLISHERS OF THIS APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING AS A USE OF THIS APP. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES. NO PART OF THIS DESCRIPTION OR APP MUST BE CONSIDERED AS MEDICAL ADVICE*"

It is fast and reliable, and won’t be affected by working a long shift!\n\nData entry is kept the a minimum so there is no excuse for failing to double-check drug doses before administering them.\n\nThe app can be configured to suit the needs of your working environment. The concentrations in the suspensions and critical care sections can edited and concentrations stored for future use. The default units for each data item can be set to match you needs.\n\nWhy is Dose Chex required? Errors in the administration of medications are commonplace and can result in significant harm to patients. The 2009 NPSA report ‘Safety in Doses’ identified 72,482 medication incident reports in one year. Of these 100 had resulted in death or severe harm. In addition, such errors can have a significant effect on the person administering the medication\n\nIn acute care settings there can be many distractions, making it difficult to concentrate on the often complex calculations required when administering medicines. Removing as many potential points of human error helps make the process safer."

A major advantage of using real teeth is that many show interesting and unusual features, which would be seen on dental patients. These can be explored and are explained through an interactive guide."

      "label": "NEWS2 Calculator is designed to make it easier for healthcare professionals to calculate NEWS or NEWS2 scores during the assessment of acute illnesses in patients.\n\nThe NEWS and NEWS2 are scoring systems which use six physiological parameters, which are recorded in routine practice, to give an aggregate score which can be used to determine the best response for acutely ill patients. The six parameters are:\n- Respiratory rate\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Systolic blood pressure\n- Pulse rate\n- Level of consciousness\n- Temperature\n\nA score is allocated to each parameter during measurement. A larger score means the parameter varies more from normal levels.\n\nNEWS2 Calculator has options to colour code the controls based on their value (for example, when changing the value of a parameter which would give a score of 3, the control turns red). The colours are based upon the NEWS2 chart which healthcare workers are already familiar with, making NEWS2 Calculator extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThere is also an option for alerts to appear which provide further guidance for healthcare workers on the best course of action to take, based upon the NEWS or NEWS2 score which was calculated.\n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application has been designed to assist pre-hospital, community and hospital clinicians to calculate a National Early Warning Score for patients who are unwell.

      "label": "Do you have tinnitus or “ringing in the ears”? Tinnitus HQ helps you understand and relieve your tinnitus symptoms.\n\nRecent research shows that tinnitus can be treated by listening to sounds that have been filtered to remove your specific tinnitus frequencies.*\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ, you can apply advanced filters to over 500 high-quality sounds to find relief for your symptoms.\n\nSimply apply a bandpass filter to any sound or mix to isolate frequencies in a narrow range. Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

It doesn’t set out to replace a standard text book. It certainly isn’t a substitute for a sound knowledge of anatomy and local anaesthetic pharmacology. It’s more of a guide to the occasional blocker, a refresher to the more experienced, and a teaching aid to the trainer. \n\nWe are a busy hospital with a heavy teaching commitment. Therefore we choose to use nerve stimulation in conjunction with ultrasound as we feel it adds another layer of safety to the patient, and reassurance to the operator."

      "label": "The purpose of this App is to accurately record the units you are consuming.  You do this by, at least, knowing the percentage alcohol and the amount of the drink - specified in ml, cl, litres, uk pints or US fl ozs.  Unlike other Apps it does not care what the drink is (e.g. a glass of wine or a pint of beer) just the units.  It does not judge you about the amount you are drinking it is trying to help you recognise how much you are drinking and manage that however you want.\n\nRecent changes have introduced the ability to mark a day as Alcohol Free, change the number of days used to calculate the rolling averages shown and, with this update, the ability to change the percentage alcohol and drink amount using the watch App rather than having to use the phone to make these changes.\n\nEver wondered how many units there are in a drink?  This App can can be used to just calculate the number of units in a drink but it can also be used to keep track of units consumed.  Just press the 'Add Units' button.  Until you ask yourself the question how many units am I consuming day by day, week by week and through the months you will have no idea.  Many people wildly underestimate the amount they drink.  This App can tell you and it can be very enlightening.  Unlike other Apps this one makes no judgement on how much you drink it is a means for you to understand the amounts and to act as you see fit.  If you choose to cut down then that is your choice.  Maybe this App will confirm that apart from the odd day or two you are generally within guidelines.  \n\nThis App is not restricted in the amounts that can be entered unlike other similar Apps.  The values are entered using a decimal number pad so you are not restricted by the values specified on picker wheels. You can enter ANY amounts using US fl Ozs, millilitres, centilitres, litres, UK pints.\n\nDrink Driving Limits: A 3.6% abv pint of beer has 2 units in it.  In the UK to remain within the drink drive limit you can have no more than 1 pint of weak (3.6%) beer - any more and you risk being over the drink drive limit.  Note, that the last sentence used the word 'weak', not one pint of beer but one pint of weak beer.  So what difference does that make?  Well a 5% beer has 2.84 units in it.  So, you're probably pushing the upper limit, if not already over it.\n\nLegal Disclaimer:  Do not use this App as a guide to whether you can drive a car or not.  This App is just for calculating and collating the number of units consumed.\n\nNow with Apple Watch support & iCloud Support to save your precious information. Easy to add the same units from your Apple Watch.  See how many units you've consumed today glancing at your Apple Watch. Save you units consumed to iCloud.  Retrieve them on another device."

It’s very easy to use and has room for notes if you want to add them. It’s much better than the basic sheet I was given by the nurse and shows up plainly how effective the meds are. Well worth paying for, thank you!"

      "label": "Squeezy CF has been reviewed, supported and endorsed by the CF Trust.\n\nIt is recognised that one impact of the exercise recommendations and airway clearance techniques for individuals with Cystic Fibrosis is that the pelvic floor can be put under strain, leading to pelvic floor dysfunction such as stress incontinence. This can happen to men and women, although it is more common in women. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can help to prevent and treat these problems, reducing pelvic floor, bladder and bowel symptoms and supporting the active lifestyle that is important for general health.\n\nSqueezy CF has been designed by chartered physiotherapists specialising in Pelvic Health working in the NHS. It is suitable for everyone who wants to do pelvic floor muscle exercises (also called Kegel exercises). The app is particularly aimed at those who are seeing a specialist physiotherapist for problems connected to their bladder, bowels or pelvic floor muscles as it can be tailored to a specific exercise programme and set to remind you when to do your exercises. It is simple to use, discreet, informative and has helpful visual and audio prompts to support your exercise programme plus it maintains a record of the number of exercises you have completed.\n\nFeatures:\n • Apple Watch support! Be extra discrete, squeeze from your watch\n • Customisable exercise plan\n • “Professional mode” to help physiotherapists set detailed exercise plans for patients\n • Visual, and audio guides for exercises\n • Information and tips written by professional Pelvic Health physiotherapists\n • Track and monitor your progress\n • Write a short note after a completed exercise\n • Simple and clear interface"

      "label": "Dr. Goniometer is a tool whereby physiatrists, orthopaedists and physiotherapists can measure the movement angles of their patient’s articulations and store all related data.\nIt is the only tool supported scientifically by comparative studies on real cases, as mentioned hereunder.\n\nThe tool enables the management of patient records, measurement of patient articulation angles and storage of all related information to build up historical data bases for each articulation and movement.\n\nMeasurement is by photographing the articulation and identifying the pictures taken with three separate markers. Picture taking is supported with perpendicular reference to ground level, iPhone alignment identification and patient central position referencing. These data come from Medical Literature suggestions for completing this type of reliable measurement (Cf. for instance, Dunlevy C. et al. \"Procedural considerations for photographic-based joint angle measurements\", Physiother. Res. Int. 2005; 10(4): 190-200).\n\nDr. Goniometer has been used in recent studies – the publication of which is currently under way – that have identified reliability and measurement errors comparable to those of professional measurement tools (such as the Universal Goniometer, Isokinetic Tools Goniometer and the like).\nThe study \"A new iPhone-based Goniometer (Dr. Goniometer): a Validation Study\", in particular, reports that various measurements on several patients were made simultaneously with professional tools and Dr. Goniometer. Measurements with the latter were repeated by different physiatrists and physiotherapists and results indicate comparable measurement errors for the Dr. Goniometer and other tools.\n\nIn addition to the above, further features are also available through in-app purchase to:\n- computer browse all Dr. Goniometer data (such as patient records, measurements, photos and the like) and print any patient articulation record;\n- backup all Dr. Goniometer data on the computer;\n- use a previously created back-up to restore all Dr. Goniometer data on any iPhone (as in the event of iPhone replacement or application re-installation, for instance).\n- export all measures in a Excel file through iTunes File Sharing, connecting your iphone and PC through the USB cable.\n\nAll the above features are available with no additional computer software required, just a common Internet browser; any operating system is supported, whether Microsoft, Apple, or others.\nThe iPhone and PC used must be on the same WiFi network for computer and Dr. Goniometer connection. Should no WiFi connection be available, if the iPhone is be connected to a mobile network and the PC to the Internet, the iPhone and computer connection will be based on the settings of the mobile network in use.\n\nDr. Goniometer ensures constant measurement tool availability and access to patient data bases. New measurements can always be made at each patient visit, with no need for constant patient record updating as completed measurements are stored automatically on the iPhone or PC used and are retrievable whenever needed."

Therefore, effective screening is essential to begin treatment before the brain damages become irreversible. Because for early dementia stages, there are already effective treatment options that can significantly delay or even prevent the progression of the disease. \n\nWith special tests, dementia can be detected 18 years prior to the first symptoms. The Dementia Screening Test (DST) is the only such test which has been certified by Health Authorities as a Medical Device for dementia screening.\n\nThe good news is: for most people the test can give the all-clear!\n \nThe DST in short:\n- Easy to perform, also for medical laypersons.\n- Reliable: more than 96% sensitivity proven in clinical trials, probably the highest value worldwide for such tests.\n- Safe: no registration required, no storage of personal data, works without internet connection, no advertising.\n- Recognized as a medical device by Health Authorities.\n- Works with all dementia subtypes (Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, Lewy-body dementia, secondary dementia, hybrids / other forms).\n- Engaging: provides you with the latest research results on a regular basis, and reminds to retake the test regularly.\n- Documents changes in dementia risk over time.\n- Supports research and public awareness for dementia patients and relatives.\n\nTake the test now, and become a superager!"

      "label": "The \"Voice Meter Pro\" app for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, is a simple, but effective app that helps children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD's), voice disorders, or any other child (or adult) monitor the volume of their own voice in a Fun and Engaging way.\n\nChildren with Asperger’s and other ASD’s often have difficulties producing the appropriate voice volume in different settings.  Some children on the autism spectrum speak too quietly.  Others speak too loudly.  Still others do not compensate adequately for the social milieu or ambient noise level. \n\nUnderstanding abstract concepts, such as the volume of one’s voice, can be difficult for children with ASD's.  It’s well understood that adding a visual component to the otherwise abstract concept can often be very helpful for individuals with ASD.\n\nOK so how does the app work?\n\nWell….if a child is talking to quietly a blue background with a cartoon character struggling to hear is displayed. If a child is talking too loudly the background changes to red and the character puts it’s fingers in its ears. If the volume level is acceptable a green background with a smiling happy character is displayed.\n\n• The on screen “volume thermometer” dynamically displays the volume level as it changes. \n\n• There’s a \"Sensitivity\" slider so the adult can adjust the volume sensitivity to suit both the user and the environment.\n\n• There’s also a \"Dampening\" slider. This helps avoid the meter bouncing around in between words by introducing a slight delay before any movement is shown on the “volume\" thermometer.\n\n• To give the user total control over the app the Upper and Lower limits of the \"Green\" (acceptable volume area) can now be adjusted by the user.\n\n• For convenience the app works in both portrait and landscape modes on all the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.\n\n•  the iPhone version of the app has a switch to enable the iPhone to vibrate should the upper threshold level be exceeded for longer than 4 seconds.\n\nWe want to make this app the very best it can be and to this end we have included a feedback form inside the app for users to submit any issues or suggestions as to how it can be improved. \n\nWhy not download the app and give it a try?...... you might find it a very useful tool."

Senere blev jeg studenterunderviser i histologi ved Aarhus Universitet og fik ideen, til at lave dén app jeg selv havde savnet, da jeg havde faget. Ideén og visionen var simpel: At samle det mest centrale af pensum i histologi og cellebiologi og supplerer det med en masse billeder af præparater, for at skabe en god oversigt over faget samt at danne en bro mellem det teoretiske pensum og evnen til at kunne genkende celler og histologiske strukturer til eksamen.\n\nFor at gøre appen så nuanceret som muligt, er der skrevet spørgsmål med udgangspunkt i både teoretiske, kliniske og billedlige/præparatmæssige aspekter af indholdet i Genesers histologi.\n\nHistologiQuiz giver dig mulighed for at teste og repetere din viden om almen og speciel histologi. Appen indeholder \nspørgsmål til hvert af Genesers histologis 25 kapitler inddelt i separate kategorier. Hver kategori indeholder et antal spørgsmål som kan variere mellem typerne multiple choice, ja/nej og billedespørgsmål. \nFor hver quiz kan du se en status over dine besvarelser af netop denne quiz og din personlige high score. Derudover kan du kan dyste mod dine venner og læsemakker via GameCenter og funktionen 1 mod 1.\n\n• Største danske histologi app\n• 25 kategorier\n• Over 1400 spørgsmål\n• Over 320 histologiske billeder\n• Kompatibel med iPad og iPhone\n• Løbende gratis opdateringer\n• Multiplayer 1 mod 1 funktion - dyst mod din læsemakker\n\nHar du spørgsmål eller kommentarer til appen er du velkommen til at kontakte os på www.quizlab.dk eller www.facebook.com/quizlab.dk"

Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

      "label": "Clinical veterinary practice: the satisfaction of knowing that you have done the best for your patients; isn’t that what we all want?\n \nEmergency medicine can be busy and stressful with sometimes many seriously ill or injured patients. When managing these patients you need the convenience of quick reliable information. What is more convenient than your phone in your pocket or your tablet?\n\nThis is where the KIMBA Veterinary Emergency Medicine Small Animal app comes in.\n \nGot a dog in hypovolaemic shock from acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome? Need a quick reminder of cardiovascular perfusion assessment? What about guidelines on fluid resuscitation and a fluid dose calculator?\n\nGot a tomcat with urethral obstruction (“blocked cat”)? Need a quick reminder of management priorities? What about how to treat clinically significant hyperkalaemia including drug doses and a dose calculator?\n\nWHAT FEATURES DOES THE APP OFFER?\n \nDrug dose calculators:\n•\tSingle doses\n•\tSingle agent infusions\n•\tMultiagent infusions, including separate morphine-lidocaine-ketamine (MLK) calculator\n \nFluid therapy calculators:\n•\tBolus calculator\n•\tInfusion calculator\n \nDrug formularies:\n•\tMost commonly used emergency medicine drugs with doses, routes and extra comments\n•\tSeparate searchable canine and feline formularies\n \nOther features: \n•\tExtensive ‘5-minute consult’ style information on a variety of emergency complaints and disorders – including all the classics!\n•\tQuick check data including e.g. physiological parameters, potassium and glucose supplementation charts, and CPR drug doses\n•\tSeparate sections on transfusion medicine and on neonates\n•\tClinical image gallery including radiographs and ECG strips\n \nThe app is downloaded to work offline offering guaranteed reliability irrespective of your practice’s internet connection.\n \nWHO IS THE APP FOR?\n \nThis app is for veterinary surgeons and nurses/techs working in small animal/mixed practice. It will be most valuable to those dealing with emergency patient. But oh wait, isn’t that all veterinary practices?! The calculators and formularies are especially useful regardless of how many emergency patients you see.\n \nThe app will also be very helpful for veterinary students (doctors, nurses/techs) as a learning resource and clinical tool. Including in those stolen moments between seeing a case and having someone quiz you on it. We’ve got your back!\n \nWHO CREATED THE CONTENT?\n \nShailen Jasani created the app. He is a small animal veterinary Emergency and Critical Care (ECC) specialist (Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care). He has extensive experience in both primary care and referral practice (www.shailenjasani.com, www.veteccsmalltalk.com). Shailen also has considerable teaching experience, especially with primary care vets and nurses/techs and with students.\n \nBased on this experience, Shailen has created an app that provides practical help to colleagues working in clinical practice.\n \nPlease note that Shailen is very happy for you to contact him (see below). With questions about the educational information provided or queries about small animal ECC in general. But please do not get in touch with urgent questions about active cases as Shailen may not be able to respond in a suitable timeframe.\n \nCONTACT INFORMATION and OTHER RESOURCES\n \nIf you have any problems with or comments about this app please get in touch with Shailen via email at shailenjasani@gmail.com or on Twitter @VetEmCC.\n \nFor more veterinary ECC resources, check out: the FREE Veterinary ECC Small Talk podcast available in Apple Podcasts, SoundCloud and on the Veterinary ECC Small Talk website (www.veteccsmalltalk.com/ecc-resources/). You may also wish to join our private Facebook group/page.\n \n*This app is a clinical tool that will help you to deliver the best care to your patients. Got an emergency? Relax, you’ve got it covered*"

The range and complexity of drug and infusion calculations has increased making it difficult for the clinician. The NicuApp makes it easy to make rapid and accurate calculations without distracting from the direct care of the infant. \n\nCalculation of drug and infusion doses can be time consuming and complex. The NicuApp allows users to define their own patient parameters with calculations being based on gestation, age and weight. This not only saves time, but ensures accuracy, thereby reducing the risk of drug error. \n\nThe NicuApp allows physicians and nurses to rapidly look up evidence based guidelines relevant to the care of infants. The management of a specific condition, an explanation of how to carry out a practical procedure or reference ranges for biophysical parameters. All this information is available by the cot side without the need for an internet connection. \n\nThe NicuApp makes it easy to reference suggested neonatal guidelines; calculate drug and infusion doses; along with procedural and physiological parameter calculations. A comprehensive handheld tool for medical and nursing staff of all levels. \n\nThe App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions."

Other fantastic features include:\r\n\r\n* No subscription required and once the app is downloaded no internet connection is needed\r\n* A full glossary of abbreviations\r\n* Timing functionality tailored to individual stations\r\n* 50 original scenarios covering the breadth of the examination, with more being added all the time.\r\n* Full support from the ReviseAid team.\r\n\r\nThe app is designed as an aide memoir while seeing patients on the wards prior to your exam. It is best used in pairs; one candidate holds the app while the other is examined. For stations 1,3 & 5 there is information on the things to look out for in the examination, an example presentation and a comprehensive list of facts for questioning. Stations 2 & 4 facilitate role play as each candidate has differing information pages. In order to mirror the exam there are timers for each scenario to help you get up to speed.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!"

      "label": "Anyone who snores at night is usually exhausted and not well rested the next morning. But not only that, the (spouse) partner is also prevented from sleeping because of the noise. \n\nMost of the time you will be confronted with the words: \"I have to fall asleep before you, otherwise you will start snoring and I won't be able to sleep.\" \n\nSnoring can thus become a real test of patience and there are even said to be cases where partners are no longer (able to) sleep in the same room.\n\nAlthough the number of men who snore is higher, there are also many women who snore. Therefore, this problem affects all genders.\n\nThere are several possible remedies on the market. But not all of them deliver what they promise, are expensive or very unwieldy.\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is an anti-snoring solution that works through a completely \"natural\" concept. \n\nIn the past, did your partner, with a (gentle) nudge, make you change your sleeping position to stop snoring?\n\nThis practice is a common method between many couples in bed to stop the other from snoring. \n\nThis approach often serves its purpose. However, it is usually the case that both are awake at night and then have to fall asleep again. \n\nOur Anti-Snore-App automatically fulfills exactly this purpose without anyone having to wake up for it.  \n\nAfter a short orientation period, our Silent Night app promises you: \n\n- restful and regenerative sleep for everyone involved\n- reduced disturbance of the partner's rest\n- improved oxygen intake due to the shifting of the body\n\nOur app uses state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of machine learning. We use it to evaluate your current sleeping sounds and provide you with unconscious assistance through vibrations. \n\nOf course, your data remains completely recorded on the device and will be deleted immediately after evaluation. This means that not only your restful sleep but also the protection of your data is in the forefront.\n\nLikewise, all processes operate directly on the device, data and radio connections can be independently deactivated by you (recommended!) overnight.\n\n----\nDisclaimer for medical services\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice and/or diagnoses. The Anti-Snore-App is not intended to diagnose or treat respiratory failure or other diseases/medical conditions. Please consult a licensed physician before making any decisions or taking any actions that may affect your health, safety and well-being. Do not ignore professional advice based on things you have seen, heard or read on the app, website or social media. Always consult a healthcare professional if you have questions or concerns about your snoring or overall health."

Visual Attention Therapy offers benefits that can only be achieved through technology: \n\n* Targets must be tapped from left to right, top to bottom in Practice mode, which trains users to slow down and scan the entire screen before they move on.\n* Immediate feedback with visual and auditory cues keeps users engaged.\n* Timed exercises increase motivation to work quickly and accurately.\n* Stop wasting time counting errors! Automated scoring includes data for accuracy by quadrant, time for completion, and mistakes in professional e-mailed reports.\n* Adjustable layouts and 10 levels of difficulty allow you to customize the experience to meet changing needs or multiple users.\n* Sidebar signal can flash in a variety of colors to draw attention to the left or right.\n* An endless variety of combinations eliminates the need to photocopy exercises, with the option to print screenshots when you need a traditional exercise.\n* Use only one target to focus on scanning, or use two targets at once to challenge users with working memory and alternating attention deficits. \n\n-----------\n\nRACE AGAINST THE CLOCK to improve scores while improving cognitive and reading skills. Levels featuring letters can support literacy goals, while symbol-based levels challenge visual memory skills. It’s an occupational therapy dream come true!\n\nVisual Attention Therapy was developed by a certified Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) and is used worldwide in speech and occupational therapy (OT) to help adults with left neglect after stroke and brain injury. It is also used with children with dyslexia and attentional deficits by reading specialists and neuropsychologists.\n\nDON’T JUST TELL YOUR PATIENTS TO LOOK TO THE LEFT – TRAIN THEM. Modernize your occupational therapy or speech therapy exercises with a left neglect training tool that improves stroke and brain injury rehab. \n\nDOWNLOAD IT NOW!\n\n-----------\n\nLooking for something different in a stroke therapy app?

The aim of this app is to increase the intensity of treatment for people with apraxia, combining J. Rosenbek's integral stimulation approach with B. Hill's carrier phrase facilitation drills.  \n\nThis is the original Australian version of the application, with all audio and video recorded by the Australian speech pathologist Carol Bishop. The voice is suitable for countries like Great Britain but for speakers with an American accent we recommend the US version instead.\n\nThis application shows how to produce speech sounds and words and encourages speech, even in people with severe speech difficulties. This easy to use iPad application contains over 500 videos, sound clips and colour photos designed to help adults and children to produce the consonant speech sounds in isolation, in words and in sentences. Now includes recording, playback, rhyming words and randomisation. \n\nThis software is especially helpful to those who need to hear and see a sound made, for example, patients with motor speech difficulty due to speech apraxia (verbal or oral apraxia affecting speech). \n\nProvides multimedia full-motion video cues, for independent speech practice. Cues are for individual phonemes (sounds) as well as full words. \n\nEach exercise targets one word, divided into 20 consonant \npositions. For each exercise it provides: \n\n* Color photo \n* Auditory and written trigger phrase \n* Written word \n* Video clip of a speaker \n* Records and plays back patient's voice with model sound for comparison. \n\nThis app enables intensive independent practice for Motor Speech Disorders, with immediate auditory feedback."

      "label": "WesternU’s CETL team presents EOM Sim, a realistic 3D eye simulator that shows the movement of the extraocular muscles of the eye. The movement of the human eye is one of the most complex actions in the body, with multiple muscles working in conjunction to make the eye rotate. With EOM Sim, you can observe and control each of these muscles individually and learn how each of them affects eye movement. Useful as both a teaching tool and a study tool, EOM Sim is designed to help medical students (or anyone who is curious about how their eyes work) learn about eye movement using a 3D simulation rather than text.\n\nNow in Version 2: Pupillary response and fully 3D eye muscle rendering!\n\nHow To Use:\nSimply touch the screen and the eyes will follow your finger. Use the sliders on the side of the screen to weaken individual muscles and simulate different conditions. By swiping left or right, you can find toggles to disable different cranial nerves. To access the pupil mode, use the flashlight button on the bottom. \nTo view the 3D eye model, use the leftmost button on the bottom bar. You can rotate and zoom in this mode, and you can control where the eyes look using the joystick controller to the right. You can also interact with individual muscles to further see how each works.\n\nEOM Sim is still in active development, and we are always looking for feedback and suggestions!\n\nContact:\ngamesupport@westernu.edu"

Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat Ulcers (Peptic Ulcer). If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!\n\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\n\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question about suitability of various food items for your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\n\n• Health issues often come our way in groups of two or more. They are often caused by other health complications or result in other illnesses and risks. It is for that reason, that we have included separate guidelines for those who might be at risk with any of the following common conditions along with Ulcers: Anemia (iron deficiency), Cancer risk, Depression, Diabetes, Excess body weight or Obesity, High blood pressure, High cholesterol, Menopause, Stress, and Vitamin D deficiency.\n\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\n\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Also included are suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\n\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \n\nSuggestions presented in this app are based on the content licensed from Personal Remedies, LLC. The primary sources used by Personal Remedies are US government sources such as USDA (US Department of Agriculture), NIH (National Institute of Health) agencies, and leading clinics & universities.\n\nPersonal Remedies is the publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions in the market. It is based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\n\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis.

Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\n\n “Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\n\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA"

      "label": "Why 3D ECG Leads ?\n \nAN ECG LEAD PLACEMENT GUIDE\n \nMisplacement of the ECG Leads may lead to wrong diagnoses and further unnecessary investigations or treatments (Jowett et al., 2005; Toosi and Sochanski, 2008; Harrigan, Chan and Brady, 2012; Ilg and Lehmann, 2012; Lynch, 2014). In their study (Medani et al., 2018) showed that in only 34% of cases, the ECG Chest Leads were placed correctly.\n \nAll medical personnel who are operating a 12 Lead ECG machine should have the appropriate training for ECG lead placement (Kligfield et al., 2007; Crawford and Doherty, 2010). The purpose of 3D ECG Leads is not aimed at replacing high-quality training but instead, to act as an aid and to show you in a simple 3D interactive way the Standard Lead Placement Technique.\n \nAN ECG LEADS VISUALISATION TOOL\n \nIn a standard 12 Lead ECG Tracing, not all of the ECG Leads are organized in anatomical order. One recent study (Lindow et al., 2019) highlights the fact that displaying all the 12 ECG Leads in an anatomical sequence has a positive impact in diagnosing Acute Myocardial Infarction. 3D ECG Leads serves as a 3D interactive tool for the anatomical visualization of the ECG Leads. \n  \nWHY ONLY 10 LEADS. HOW AN ECG LEAD IS GENERATED.\n \nWith 3D ECG Leads you can visualize how the ECG Machine reads the heart's electrical activity, and how 3 Electrodes are generating 6 Leads.\n\nReferences \n\nCrawford, J. and Doherty, L.

A text label above the timer will inform you if there is still a 24 hour time frame in progress and the app will inform you that doses cannot be given if reached a Max Dose within this time frame.  A Notification will also be set to your device to inform you that the 24 hour time frame is finished for each specific child.  (Please make sure you have Notifications turned on in iPhone Settings - Notifications - Child Meds   for this to work).\n\n\n• Record Temperature: \nYou can record the child's temperature at the point of administering the medication.  \nA popup prompt will ask you each time you press the 'Start timing' button in the app.\n• No temperature reading at this time? ... Just tap on the temperature box to enter manually, this will also add details to the Log.\n• The temperature label will give a colour coding depending on the entered temperature -- Green, Orange and Red indicating on severity of the temperature.\n\n\n• Dose History Log:\nHistorical Log of child's name and doses given on dates and times will be saved on your device to review at a later date.\nWhen entering a temperature manually, this will also be indicated as such with a time and date stamp to let you know when it was entered.\n\nJust for children?  - Why not use it for yourself or other adults too!"

Use the \"Share Trial\" button to send a PubMed link and quick summary. Using this feature, it’s incredibly easy to share pivotal critical care trials with students, residents, and other colleagues.\n\nThe database features 150+ landmark trials related to: ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT/PE, delirium, glycemic control, heart failure, hemorrhage, meningitis, nephroprotection, nutrition, pneumonia, sedation, seizure, sepsis/shock, spinal cord injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage – with more trials and topics to be added on a regular basis!\n\nThis app is designed and maintained by Sean P.

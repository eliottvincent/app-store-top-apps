      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

      "label": "****Thank you for making us a TOP 25 App in US, UK and Canada App Store category specific rankings!****\n\nSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a kind of depression that appears at certain times of the year. Light therapy is one of the potential treatments for this condition. Almost 80% of the people who try light therapy find it beneficial. This app converts your apple device into a light box.\n\nWhy you SHOULD NOT download this App:\n1. If you are looking for a SAD Light Box App that generates an intensity of 10,000 Lux\n2. If you are looking for a quick fix and can not commit to consistent morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks\n3. If you will get turned off by the simplicity of this app and the solution to Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nWhy you SHOULD download this App:\n1. If you want to try a cheap yet effective alternative to a traditional Light box which uses lower intensity BLUE LIGHT (approx. 100 to 575 Lux) and is backed by research (Google research paper: The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in sub-syndromal seasonal affective disorder by NCBI, US National Library of Medicine)\n2. If you would rather be intelligent and try something for a fiver rather than spend a few hundred dollars on a conventional light box\n3. If you are able to consistently commit to regular morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks \n4. If you would be happy with a REALLY SIMPLE APP that transforms your Apple device into a Light box and is more portable and user friendly\n5. If the weather is making you sad :( and you would rather be happy :)\n     \nThis app can also help you:\n1. Determine if you are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/ Cabin Fever/ Winter Blues/ Seasonal Depression with help of a short scored test\n2. Create your own unique shade of Blue / White / any other color light that works best for you\n3. Use the app as a Dawn Simulator (set alarm)\n4. Set timer for your light box to time your morning exposure sessions\n5. Shop for other products to help with SAD\n6. Listen to the Radio in the background\n\nUV Rating: The UV emission from your Apple Device is 0, hence this app does not have a UV rating. \n\nSome other activities you might want to try to deal with symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder are:\n• End your morning shower with a cold shower\n• Try to arrange the spaces you spend time in to maximize sunlight exposure\n• Keep curtains open during the day\n• Trim tree branches or hedges that may be blocking some of the light from getting into your home\n• Move furniture so that you sit near a window or, if you exercise indoors, set up your exercise equipment by a window\n• Install skylights and add lamps\n• Build physical activity into your lifestyle preferably before SAD symptoms take hold. Physical activity relieves stress, builds energy and increases both your physical and mental well-being and resilience\n• Make a habit of taking a daily noon-hour walk, particularly if you commute to school or work in the dark hours of the day\n• Meditate at least 20 min a day (focus on your breathing)\n• Try High intensity training if you are fit enough and have less time\n• Maintain good sleep hygiene\n• When all else fails, try a winter vacation in sunny climates—if the pocket and work schedule allow. Keep in mind that the symptoms will recur after you return home\n\nREFUND POLICY: If you consistently use the App for 14 days and show us that you genuinely tried but did not get any results, WE WILL REFUND 100% OF YOUR MONEY. *Subject to terms and conditions of Apple Inc. and the Apple App Store.\n\nSmile, because somewhere far away, we are cheering for you :)\n\n*THIS APP MUST NOT BE USED TO SUBSTITUTE ANY MEDICATION/ MEDICAL DEVICE. THE CREATORS/ PUBLISHERS OF THIS APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING AS A USE OF THIS APP. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES.

      "label": "NEWS2 Calculator is designed to make it easier for healthcare professionals to calculate NEWS or NEWS2 scores during the assessment of acute illnesses in patients.\n\nThe NEWS and NEWS2 are scoring systems which use six physiological parameters, which are recorded in routine practice, to give an aggregate score which can be used to determine the best response for acutely ill patients. The six parameters are:\n- Respiratory rate\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Systolic blood pressure\n- Pulse rate\n- Level of consciousness\n- Temperature\n\nA score is allocated to each parameter during measurement. A larger score means the parameter varies more from normal levels.\n\nNEWS2 Calculator has options to colour code the controls based on their value (for example, when changing the value of a parameter which would give a score of 3, the control turns red). The colours are based upon the NEWS2 chart which healthcare workers are already familiar with, making NEWS2 Calculator extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThere is also an option for alerts to appear which provide further guidance for healthcare workers on the best course of action to take, based upon the NEWS or NEWS2 score which was calculated.\n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application has been designed to assist pre-hospital, community and hospital clinicians to calculate a National Early Warning Score for patients who are unwell.

      "label": "Do you have tinnitus or “ringing in the ears”? Tinnitus HQ helps you understand and relieve your tinnitus symptoms.\n\nRecent research shows that tinnitus can be treated by listening to sounds that have been filtered to remove your specific tinnitus frequencies.*\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ, you can apply advanced filters to over 500 high-quality sounds to find relief for your symptoms.\n\nSimply apply a bandpass filter to any sound or mix to isolate frequencies in a narrow range. Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

This can happen to men and women, although it is more common in women. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can help to prevent and treat these problems, reducing pelvic floor, bladder and bowel symptoms and supporting the active lifestyle that is important for general health.\n\nSqueezy CF has been designed by chartered physiotherapists specialising in Pelvic Health working in the NHS. It is suitable for everyone who wants to do pelvic floor muscle exercises (also called Kegel exercises). The app is particularly aimed at those who are seeing a specialist physiotherapist for problems connected to their bladder, bowels or pelvic floor muscles as it can be tailored to a specific exercise programme and set to remind you when to do your exercises. It is simple to use, discreet, informative and has helpful visual and audio prompts to support your exercise programme plus it maintains a record of the number of exercises you have completed.\n\nFeatures:\n • Apple Watch support! Be extra discrete, squeeze from your watch\n • Customisable exercise plan\n • “Professional mode” to help physiotherapists set detailed exercise plans for patients\n • Visual, and audio guides for exercises\n • Information and tips written by professional Pelvic Health physiotherapists\n • Track and monitor your progress\n • Write a short note after a completed exercise\n • Simple and clear interface"

      "label": "SleepCheck is more than a sleep or snore recorder, it assesses your risk of sleep apnoea by analysing your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. \n\n**Why should I take the test?**\nSleep apnoea (or apnea) is a serious medical condition that can have a major impact on your life. If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected. No account setup required. - \n\nYour sleep recording never leaves your iPhone. Once analysed, it is deleted. \n\nYour age, gender, sleep duration and risk assessment will be collected by ResApp Health and used to improve our products and services. This will not include any data that will identify you. To find out more, please read our privacy policy.\n\nFor use on adults aged 18 years and above.\n\nAlways read and follow the Instructions before Use.

The method has been used in more than 30 international clinical studies in the past 20 years. \n\nIt gives you the ability to assess and quantify your tremor and to keep track of your values. You can upload your results as Text Files to your iCloud Drive for further visualization, or to share and import them to personal EHR apps. \n\nFor more information, visit www.studymyhealth.com\n\nTremor is the notion for the trembling of a limb. Most prominent is the trembling of the outstretched hand, that everyone is aware of in special situations like excitement or strenuous workouts. Whereas a light trembling of the hand is present in all humans, increased amplitude of the trembling can lead to serious problems in daily life. Increased trembling could be a symptom of a wide variety of diseases, as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor disease, hypothyroidism, or various psychiatric conditions.\n\nTHIS APP IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, OR CURE ANY DISEASE.\n\nNote: Tremor severity and frequency are not supported by iHealth; as soon as these values are available we will connect the App to the iHealth ecosystem. \n\niPad Users: Note that the App is not working on the iPad; it does NOT make sense to measure hand tremor using an iPad, the device is too large and heavy to perform the measurements."

You can make your own quizzes, or have the app quiz you only on what you have missed.  Includes over 416 anatomical structures in beautiful 3d renderings. The topics include 167 bones and landmarks, 138 muscles, and 111 organ images.  Turn on the timer option for an extra challenge!\n  Try this unique anatomy quiz game and you'll be happy you did!\n\nA quick anatomy lesson: this app features ALL the bones and many landmarks, but in the bone section, there are only 53 bones listed.... aren't there 206 bones in the body?  Most of the bones are bilateral... one on each side, so we don't quiz the right femur and left femur, this cuts the list down almost in half. Many bones are repeat... 12 ribs on each side, 10 distal phalanges, 10 proximal phalanges... When we take out all these repetitive bones, we are left with about 53 unique bones.... so please know that this app has been designed by experienced intelligent anatomists!"

      "label": "Instant Z-Scores For All The Paediatric Cardiology Parameters You Review Everyday.\n\nCardio Z has been developed by the experienced Paediatric Cardiology team at Evelina Children's Hospital, London, UK in collaboration with the technology company UBQO. The application makes it easy to calculate Z-scores and centiles for the many cardiac and paediatric measurements that are made in normal clinical practice. Cardio Z distils a wealth of clinical research parameters into a single accessible format.\n\nZ–scores and centiles are a means of expressing how far a measurement is above (positive Z-score) or below (negative Z-score) the average for the size or age of a patient. They are particularly important in assessing and monitoring growing patients, from fetal life though to adulthood.\n\nHealth professionals need to be able to access the normal ranges for cardiac parameters at every age and size, and cross-checking of measurements can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Cardio Z will prove invaluable for both clinicians working directly in Paediatric Cardiology, and those who work in other fields of Paediatrics.\n\nCardio Z allows users to access Z-scores without the need for an internet connection, or the requirement to input the same data in multiple calculators. Users can define their own settings so that they can be sure that their use of z-scores is consistent over time, whilst still allowing flexibility for the experienced clinician. Comprehensive guidance is available ensuring that measurements are consistent with those of the original research, allowing valid comparisons.\n\nCardio-Z creates a summary of all z-scores for each patient, which can then be saved, e-mailed or printed. Simple, reliable and time-saving.\n\nFULL LIST OF FEATURES:\n\n- Cardio Z allows calculation of z-scores of:\n- Height, weight, BMI and head circumference\n- Clinic blood pressure, with calculation of a user-defined 'target centile' blood pressure\n- Echocardiographic measurements of most cardiac structures, including valves, chambers, vessels and coronary arteries\n- Fetal echocardiographic measurements, using gestational age, femur length or biparietal diameter as size reference\n- M-mode echocardiography, including TAPSE\n- Pulsed wave velocities, including E/E' ratio and E/A ratio\n- Tissue Doppler velocities and time intervals. Including Isovolumetric Contraction Time (IVCT), Isovolumetric Relaxation Time (IVRT), Ejection Time and Myocardial Performance Index\n- Discriminant scores for neonatal aortic stenosis with borderline left ventricle\n- ECG parameters (2nd and 98th centiles) and corrected QT interval calculation\n\nEXTRA FEATURES:\n\n- Guidance tips for measurements, including diagrams and notes of the methods of the original researchers\n- Centiles, as well as z-scores, displayed for all parameters\n- No need to re-enter height and weight: baseline data only needs to be entered once\n- Generation of a .pdf summary which can be saved, e-mailed or printed\n- Saved patient Z-score summaries can be accessed and edited at a later date\n- Short-cut keys for frequently used parameters\n- Body surface area calculator can be defined to use the same algorithms as the original research\n- Cardio Z reduces the inconvenience of making Z-score calculations, and improves the correct application of this important clinical tool. The App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions.  \n\nWe hope you enjoy using Cardio Z!"

The app's efficacy is supported by independent research studies, including a 2016 study by Huntington University published in the Journal of Hand Therapy.\n\n• Increases coordination and motor control in the hands and fingers\n\n• Works for kids and adults\n\n• Automatically creates performance and usage reports that can be emailed\n\n• Speeds recovery from injuries and stroke\n\n• Designed in consultation with Occupational Therapists\n\n• Turns the iPad into a therapeutic tool\n \nFor best therapeutic results the exercises should be done on a regular basis in short sessions. The exercises are designed to be repeatable and engaging.\n\nThe automatic tracking and reporting feature makes it easy for parents, teachers and occupational therapists to identify time on task and progress.  You can email the progress reports right from the app itself.\n\nMulti-user tracking is available as an in-app purchase. (Note to Volume Purchase Program customers: Consider buying Dexteria VPP instead. It includes multi-user tracking and you will pay a lower net cost than if you buy Dexteria and upgrade each copy via the in-app purchase. Just search \"Dexteria VPP\" in the app store.)\n\n                    *****\n\"Very impressed with this app. I've been looking for something like this for a very long time.\"  - from Apps for Children with Special Needs\n\n\"For occupational therapists, the one huge benefit is the ability to track the child's progress.\" - from YourTherapySource.com\n\nEditor's Choice Award from Children's Technology Review\n\n\"Outstanding app and I highly recommend it. Children are very motivated to use it. I’m a Pediatric Occupational Therapist and I use it to work on fine motor integration, fine motor precision, hand exercises, handwriting, writing speed, etc.\"  - Authentic app store review\n                    *****\n\n\n\nATTENTION LICENSED OTs: If you are a licensed OT and have comments about Dexteria, please submit a review and tell us what we did right and where we can improve. We will respond to your comments in the form of free upgrades with product improvements. You can influence the evolution of Dexteria!\n\n\nWe're serious about your privacy. This app does not track or share your personal information with us or anyone else. There is no user id tracking software, and no advertisements.  In summary, we have no idea who you are! :-)"

Its goal is the financial support of scientific research projects in the field of prostate cancer, as well as other cancers of the urinary tract.\nPlease be aware that the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS cannot be 100% accurate at predicting the presence or absence of prostate cancer. It is designed to help calculate your risk, not give a definitive diagnosis.\nThe Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS provides a general risk calculation based on your PSA level and other information.\nWhile knowing your PSA level is helpful, the decision to have a PSA test has to be taken seriously after weighing up all factors and discussing the implications with your GP or hospital doctor.\nIt is possible that prostate cancer will not be found even if you have an elevated PSA. However, it may be present even if your PSA level is low.\nYour doctor may want to take further tests. If you have doubts or questions about your health, you should always contact your GP or hospital doctor. This is particularly important if you have questions which arise from the use of our prostate cancer risk calculator.\nIt cannot be ruled out that the way the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS is used, or the indications given by it, are interpreted in a manner that is not appropriate. The creators of the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS do not accept any responsibility in any respect.\nThe European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer has published its 11-year follow-up results (New England Journal of Medicine, March 15 2012). Once again, they demonstrate that screening does significantly reduce death from prostate cancer. The latest study confirms that a man who undergoes PSA testing will have his risk of dying from prostate cancer reduced by 29%.\nERSPC is the world’s largest randomized prostate cancer screening study. It was designed to investigate whether early detection and treatment of prostate cancer might reduce disease-specific mortality and also help to identify men at risk. From 1992, the ERSPC study randomized 162,000 men, aged 55 to 69, across Europe to either a screening arm or a control group.\n\nDesigned and developed for iOS by Nuno Azevedo of Ydeal.net Software LDA"

Often it is very difficult for the sufferer to figure out if the compulsion is driven by OCD or if they are truly necessary. It is also very difficult to stop once the person is stuck in the process of a compulsive action.\nIn this book we will go over these topics in depth and answer all questions regarding stopping both physical and mental compulsions.\n\nThe goal is to fully overcome OCD so you no longer have the urge to do compulsions. This book will also explain the effect that they have on OCD and how to overcome OCD and end the compulsions.\n\nDisclaimer: This app is for information purposes only and is not medical advice.

      "label": "Do your children often have a fever? Do you sometimes get confused remembering when exactly it started, how it progressed and what other symptoms occurred? Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

It is fast and reliable, and won’t be affected by working a long shift!\n\nData entry is kept the a minimum so there is no excuse for failing to double-check drug doses before administering them.\n\nThe app can be configured to suit the needs of your working environment. The concentrations in the suspensions and critical care sections can edited and concentrations stored for future use. The default units for each data item can be set to match you needs.\n\nWhy is Dose Chex required? Errors in the administration of medications are commonplace and can result in significant harm to patients. The 2009 NPSA report ‘Safety in Doses’ identified 72,482 medication incident reports in one year. Of these 100 had resulted in death or severe harm. In addition, such errors can have a significant effect on the person administering the medication\n\nIn acute care settings there can be many distractions, making it difficult to concentrate on the often complex calculations required when administering medicines. Removing as many potential points of human error helps make the process safer."

The anatomy tab gives an overview of anatomy related to the specific block, it includes schematic diagram’s which can be expanded to full screen. The procedures tab is a full pictorial and text guide to the performance of the specific block, including annotated ultrasound screen captures to help visualise nerves. The tips tab contains useful advice related to the selected block, also included is advice on the use of ultrasound and local anaesthetics.\n\nA must have app for both junior and senior anaesthetic staff as well as practitioners working within regional anaesthesia.\n\nThe blocks are:\n\nInterscalene & Mapping\nSupraclavicular & Mapping\nInfraclavicular\nAxillary x 2 & Mapping\nRadial Nerve & Mapping\nMedian Nerve & Mapping\nUlnar Nerve & Mapping\nTAP\nFemoral Nerve & CPNB\nSaphenous Nerve\nPopliteal Sciatic\nPECS1\nPECS2\nPECS1 and 2 combined\nSerratus anterior\n\nDedicated nerve mapping videos now make orientating yourself with anatomy even easier.

It doesn’t set out to replace a standard text book. It certainly isn’t a substitute for a sound knowledge of anatomy and local anaesthetic pharmacology. It’s more of a guide to the occasional blocker, a refresher to the more experienced, and a teaching aid to the trainer. \n\nWe are a busy hospital with a heavy teaching commitment. Therefore we choose to use nerve stimulation in conjunction with ultrasound as we feel it adds another layer of safety to the patient, and reassurance to the operator."

      "label": "The purpose of this App is to accurately record the units you are consuming.  You do this by, at least, knowing the percentage alcohol and the amount of the drink - specified in ml, cl, litres, uk pints or US fl ozs.  Unlike other Apps it does not care what the drink is (e.g. a glass of wine or a pint of beer) just the units.  It does not judge you about the amount you are drinking it is trying to help you recognise how much you are drinking and manage that however you want.\n\nRecent changes have introduced the ability to mark a day as Alcohol Free, change the number of days used to calculate the rolling averages shown and, with this update, the ability to change the percentage alcohol and drink amount using the watch App rather than having to use the phone to make these changes.\n\nEver wondered how many units there are in a drink?  This App can can be used to just calculate the number of units in a drink but it can also be used to keep track of units consumed.  Just press the 'Add Units' button.  Until you ask yourself the question how many units am I consuming day by day, week by week and through the months you will have no idea.  Many people wildly underestimate the amount they drink.  This App can tell you and it can be very enlightening.  Unlike other Apps this one makes no judgement on how much you drink it is a means for you to understand the amounts and to act as you see fit.  If you choose to cut down then that is your choice.  Maybe this App will confirm that apart from the odd day or two you are generally within guidelines.  \n\nThis App is not restricted in the amounts that can be entered unlike other similar Apps.  The values are entered using a decimal number pad so you are not restricted by the values specified on picker wheels. You can enter ANY amounts using US fl Ozs, millilitres, centilitres, litres, UK pints.\n\nDrink Driving Limits: A 3.6% abv pint of beer has 2 units in it.  In the UK to remain within the drink drive limit you can have no more than 1 pint of weak (3.6%) beer - any more and you risk being over the drink drive limit.  Note, that the last sentence used the word 'weak', not one pint of beer but one pint of weak beer.  So what difference does that make?  Well a 5% beer has 2.84 units in it.  So, you're probably pushing the upper limit, if not already over it.\n\nLegal Disclaimer:  Do not use this App as a guide to whether you can drive a car or not.  This App is just for calculating and collating the number of units consumed.\n\nNow with Apple Watch support & iCloud Support to save your precious information. Easy to add the same units from your Apple Watch.  See how many units you've consumed today glancing at your Apple Watch. Save you units consumed to iCloud.  Retrieve them on another device."

Nice graphics, easy to use and easy to understand.\n\n*****May 5, 2018 Excellent for those under assessment\nI wanted an easy to use app that just plotted readings before and after meds and this fits the bill perfectly. It’s very easy to use and has room for notes if you want to add them. It’s much better than the basic sheet I was given by the nurse and shows up plainly how effective the meds are. Well worth paying for, thank you!"

      "label": "Dr. Goniometer is a tool whereby physiatrists, orthopaedists and physiotherapists can measure the movement angles of their patient’s articulations and store all related data.\nIt is the only tool supported scientifically by comparative studies on real cases, as mentioned hereunder.\n\nThe tool enables the management of patient records, measurement of patient articulation angles and storage of all related information to build up historical data bases for each articulation and movement.\n\nMeasurement is by photographing the articulation and identifying the pictures taken with three separate markers. Picture taking is supported with perpendicular reference to ground level, iPhone alignment identification and patient central position referencing. These data come from Medical Literature suggestions for completing this type of reliable measurement (Cf. for instance, Dunlevy C. et al. \"Procedural considerations for photographic-based joint angle measurements\", Physiother. Res. Int. 2005; 10(4): 190-200).\n\nDr. Goniometer has been used in recent studies – the publication of which is currently under way – that have identified reliability and measurement errors comparable to those of professional measurement tools (such as the Universal Goniometer, Isokinetic Tools Goniometer and the like).\nThe study \"A new iPhone-based Goniometer (Dr. Goniometer): a Validation Study\", in particular, reports that various measurements on several patients were made simultaneously with professional tools and Dr. Goniometer. Measurements with the latter were repeated by different physiatrists and physiotherapists and results indicate comparable measurement errors for the Dr. Goniometer and other tools.\n\nIn addition to the above, further features are also available through in-app purchase to:\n- computer browse all Dr. Goniometer data (such as patient records, measurements, photos and the like) and print any patient articulation record;\n- backup all Dr. Goniometer data on the computer;\n- use a previously created back-up to restore all Dr. Goniometer data on any iPhone (as in the event of iPhone replacement or application re-installation, for instance).\n- export all measures in a Excel file through iTunes File Sharing, connecting your iphone and PC through the USB cable.\n\nAll the above features are available with no additional computer software required, just a common Internet browser; any operating system is supported, whether Microsoft, Apple, or others.\nThe iPhone and PC used must be on the same WiFi network for computer and Dr. Goniometer connection. Should no WiFi connection be available, if the iPhone is be connected to a mobile network and the PC to the Internet, the iPhone and computer connection will be based on the settings of the mobile network in use.\n\nDr. Goniometer ensures constant measurement tool availability and access to patient data bases. New measurements can always be made at each patient visit, with no need for constant patient record updating as completed measurements are stored automatically on the iPhone or PC used and are retrievable whenever needed."

The DST very effectively detects early dementia stages, and can reliably distinguish between the different dementia severity levels. It is therefore suitable for dementia screening, as well as for severity monitoring / therapy control over time.\n\nAdditional functions include:\n- a reminder to redo the test after 3-6 months, for medical monitoring \n- continued engagement for prevention, through regular Dementia News \n- tracking of the dementia risk over time, visualized in a graphic\n- option to e-mail and/or print the test results (e.g., for discussion with a physician) \n\nTo date, there is no effective treatment for advanced dementia stages. Therefore, effective screening is essential to begin treatment before the brain damages become irreversible. Because for early dementia stages, there are already effective treatment options that can significantly delay or even prevent the progression of the disease. \n\nWith special tests, dementia can be detected 18 years prior to the first symptoms. The Dementia Screening Test (DST) is the only such test which has been certified by Health Authorities as a Medical Device for dementia screening.\n\nThe good news is: for most people the test can give the all-clear!\n \nThe DST in short:\n- Easy to perform, also for medical laypersons.\n- Reliable: more than 96% sensitivity proven in clinical trials, probably the highest value worldwide for such tests.\n- Safe: no registration required, no storage of personal data, works without internet connection, no advertising.\n- Recognized as a medical device by Health Authorities.\n- Works with all dementia subtypes (Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, Lewy-body dementia, secondary dementia, hybrids / other forms).\n- Engaging: provides you with the latest research results on a regular basis, and reminds to retake the test regularly.\n- Documents changes in dementia risk over time.\n- Supports research and public awareness for dementia patients and relatives.\n\nTake the test now, and become a superager!"

      "label": "The \"Voice Meter Pro\" app for the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch, is a simple, but effective app that helps children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD's), voice disorders, or any other child (or adult) monitor the volume of their own voice in a Fun and Engaging way.\n\nChildren with Asperger’s and other ASD’s often have difficulties producing the appropriate voice volume in different settings.  Some children on the autism spectrum speak too quietly.  Others speak too loudly.  Still others do not compensate adequately for the social milieu or ambient noise level. \n\nUnderstanding abstract concepts, such as the volume of one’s voice, can be difficult for children with ASD's.  It’s well understood that adding a visual component to the otherwise abstract concept can often be very helpful for individuals with ASD.\n\nOK so how does the app work?\n\nWell….if a child is talking to quietly a blue background with a cartoon character struggling to hear is displayed. If a child is talking too loudly the background changes to red and the character puts it’s fingers in its ears. If the volume level is acceptable a green background with a smiling happy character is displayed.\n\n• The on screen “volume thermometer” dynamically displays the volume level as it changes. \n\n• There’s a \"Sensitivity\" slider so the adult can adjust the volume sensitivity to suit both the user and the environment.\n\n• There’s also a \"Dampening\" slider. This helps avoid the meter bouncing around in between words by introducing a slight delay before any movement is shown on the “volume\" thermometer.\n\n• To give the user total control over the app the Upper and Lower limits of the \"Green\" (acceptable volume area) can now be adjusted by the user.\n\n• For convenience the app works in both portrait and landscape modes on all the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.\n\n•  the iPhone version of the app has a switch to enable the iPhone to vibrate should the upper threshold level be exceeded for longer than 4 seconds.\n\nWe want to make this app the very best it can be and to this end we have included a feedback form inside the app for users to submit any issues or suggestions as to how it can be improved. \n\nWhy not download the app and give it a try?...... you might find it a very useful tool."

      "label": "Da jeg selv læste histologi manglede jeg et nemt og godt quizværktøj, til at få trænet og repeteret det teksttunge pensum. Senere blev jeg studenterunderviser i histologi ved Aarhus Universitet og fik ideen, til at lave dén app jeg selv havde savnet, da jeg havde faget. Ideén og visionen var simpel: At samle det mest centrale af pensum i histologi og cellebiologi og supplerer det med en masse billeder af præparater, for at skabe en god oversigt over faget samt at danne en bro mellem det teoretiske pensum og evnen til at kunne genkende celler og histologiske strukturer til eksamen.\n\nFor at gøre appen så nuanceret som muligt, er der skrevet spørgsmål med udgangspunkt i både teoretiske, kliniske og billedlige/præparatmæssige aspekter af indholdet i Genesers histologi.\n\nHistologiQuiz giver dig mulighed for at teste og repetere din viden om almen og speciel histologi. Appen indeholder \nspørgsmål til hvert af Genesers histologis 25 kapitler inddelt i separate kategorier. Hver kategori indeholder et antal spørgsmål som kan variere mellem typerne multiple choice, ja/nej og billedespørgsmål. \nFor hver quiz kan du se en status over dine besvarelser af netop denne quiz og din personlige high score. Derudover kan du kan dyste mod dine venner og læsemakker via GameCenter og funktionen 1 mod 1.\n\n• Største danske histologi app\n• 25 kategorier\n• Over 1400 spørgsmål\n• Over 320 histologiske billeder\n• Kompatibel med iPad og iPhone\n• Løbende gratis opdateringer\n• Multiplayer 1 mod 1 funktion - dyst mod din læsemakker\n\nHar du spørgsmål eller kommentarer til appen er du velkommen til at kontakte os på www.quizlab.dk eller www.facebook.com/quizlab.dk"

      "label": "Blood calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis are important health issues. The consequences of abnormal levels are often life-changing and occasionally life-threatening. Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

When managing these patients you need the convenience of quick reliable information. What is more convenient than your phone in your pocket or your tablet?\n\nThis is where the KIMBA Veterinary Emergency Medicine Small Animal app comes in.\n \nGot a dog in hypovolaemic shock from acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome? Need a quick reminder of cardiovascular perfusion assessment? What about guidelines on fluid resuscitation and a fluid dose calculator?\n\nGot a tomcat with urethral obstruction (“blocked cat”)? Need a quick reminder of management priorities? What about how to treat clinically significant hyperkalaemia including drug doses and a dose calculator?\n\nWHAT FEATURES DOES THE APP OFFER?\n \nDrug dose calculators:\n•\tSingle doses\n•\tSingle agent infusions\n•\tMultiagent infusions, including separate morphine-lidocaine-ketamine (MLK) calculator\n \nFluid therapy calculators:\n•\tBolus calculator\n•\tInfusion calculator\n \nDrug formularies:\n•\tMost commonly used emergency medicine drugs with doses, routes and extra comments\n•\tSeparate searchable canine and feline formularies\n \nOther features: \n•\tExtensive ‘5-minute consult’ style information on a variety of emergency complaints and disorders – including all the classics!\n•\tQuick check data including e.g. physiological parameters, potassium and glucose supplementation charts, and CPR drug doses\n•\tSeparate sections on transfusion medicine and on neonates\n•\tClinical image gallery including radiographs and ECG strips\n \nThe app is downloaded to work offline offering guaranteed reliability irrespective of your practice’s internet connection.\n \nWHO IS THE APP FOR?\n \nThis app is for veterinary surgeons and nurses/techs working in small animal/mixed practice. It will be most valuable to those dealing with emergency patient. But oh wait, isn’t that all veterinary practices?! The calculators and formularies are especially useful regardless of how many emergency patients you see.\n \nThe app will also be very helpful for veterinary students (doctors, nurses/techs) as a learning resource and clinical tool. Including in those stolen moments between seeing a case and having someone quiz you on it. We’ve got your back!\n \nWHO CREATED THE CONTENT?\n \nShailen Jasani created the app. He is a small animal veterinary Emergency and Critical Care (ECC) specialist (Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care).

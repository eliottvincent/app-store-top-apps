      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "With this powerful program from Rachael Meddows, discover how hypnotherapy can help you get into the right mentality to lose weight—thereby keeping off the pounds you shed, for good. It’s all about tackling the mindset shifts you need to establish a healthier relationship with food and your body—a tactic that is often neglected with other weight loss methods.\n\nThis is not a diet. Diets can feel restrictive and don’t address the root issues, which often are the result of unhealthy relationships with food or exercise that were formed long ago. Instead, hypnosis for weight loss is a practice that reprograms the way you think about food so that you naturally develop healthier habits for the long term.\n\nThere is a reason why Rachael's apps have been downloaded millions of times, because they work.\n\nBenefits can include:\n- Faster weight loss\n- Increased body image confidence\n- Healthier habits for natural weight loss\n- Increase energy\n- Deeper relaxation\n- Improved sleep\n- Increased motivation\n- Focus\n \nThis app features: \n\n* Soothing, therapeutic hypnotherapy tracks designed by Rachael Meddows\n* High quality, state of the art recordings\n* Playlist feature you can customize with in-app purchases\n* Optional hypnosis instructions\n* Choose a short, long, or sleep induction\n* Your choice of eight different background sounds"

      "label": "NEWS2 Calculator is designed to make it easier for healthcare professionals to calculate NEWS or NEWS2 scores during the assessment of acute illnesses in patients.\n\nThe NEWS and NEWS2 are scoring systems which use six physiological parameters, which are recorded in routine practice, to give an aggregate score which can be used to determine the best response for acutely ill patients. The six parameters are:\n- Respiratory rate\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Systolic blood pressure\n- Pulse rate\n- Level of consciousness\n- Temperature\n\nA score is allocated to each parameter during measurement. A larger score means the parameter varies more from normal levels.\n\nNEWS2 Calculator has options to colour code the controls based on their value (for example, when changing the value of a parameter which would give a score of 3, the control turns red). The colours are based upon the NEWS2 chart which healthcare workers are already familiar with, making NEWS2 Calculator extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThere is also an option for alerts to appear which provide further guidance for healthcare workers on the best course of action to take, based upon the NEWS or NEWS2 score which was calculated.\n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application has been designed to assist pre-hospital, community and hospital clinicians to calculate a National Early Warning Score for patients who are unwell.

      "label": "Blood calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis are important health issues. The consequences of abnormal levels are often life-changing and occasionally life-threatening. Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

      "label": "FlashRX is a flashcard and quiz-based educational tool for healthcare students and professionals to learn the top 250 medications in the outpatient setting (also known as the Top 200 Drugs or Top 300 Drugs).  Instead of complicated, bloated drug cards, FlashRX’s drug database focuses on simple, usable information to develop your core knowledge base.\n\nThe emphasis on concise, practical knowledge will improve learning and comprehension of the top 250 drugs.  This is a learning tool – NOT a drug reference.  This app is not a comprehensive resource for drug information.\n\nThis app is perfect for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, physician assistants, nurses, nursing students, physicians, medical students, and other healthcare professionals.  The drug database is designed to aid in studying for both students in school and those preparing for standardized exams (eg, NAPLEX, BCPS, PTCB, ExCPT, PANCE/PANRE, NCLEX, USMLE, COMLEX).\n\n== FEATURES ==\n• Beautiful, intuitive flashcard and quiz modes to optimize your learning strategy\n• Flashcards and quiz content are fully customizable – test yourself on brand/generic names, drug classes, indications, adverse effects, and even typical dose ranges\n• Quiz mode includes a selection algorithm to randomly identify intelligent distractor answers to keep you on your toes\n• An adaptive (Leitner) learning mode so that your time is focused on drug cards that you haven’t yet mastered\n\n== DRUG DATABASE ==\n• Includes information on 250 of the most common outpatient medications based on net sales, total prescriptions, and unique or emerging therapeutic classes\n• Audio pronunciations of both the brand and generic names at any time throughout the app\n• Each drug entry includes its brand name, generic name, generic pronunciation, drug class, indications, adverse effects, and typical dosing\n• The drug database is completely customizable – add or remove drugs, change drug entries, and even record your own pronunciation\n• \"Group\" drugs into therapeutic classes or your own custom drug lists.  These groups can be hidden or shown to focus your studying\n\n== ADAPTIVE LEARNING STATISTICS ==\n• Both flashcard and quiz modes utilize an adaptive learning algorithm to keep track of which drug facts you know well, and which need more review\n• Track your learning progress by viewing your statistics at the end of each flashcard or quiz session, or access the dedicated Adaptive Learning Statistics page for your learning overview\n\n== AUTHOR INFORMATION == \nThis app and all of its content was created by Sean P. Kane, PharmD, BCPS – a clinical pharmacist, associate professor, and author of the popular evidence-based website, ClinCalc.com.  The drug list and drug information closely mirrors the popular video-based course series The Top 250 Drugs (https://top250drugs.com)."

They may be unsafe when they forget to use a walker or apply the wheelchair breaks before standing. All of these facts and procedures can be engrained into memory using a repetitive and effective memory training procedure.\n\nThis Spaced Retrieval Therapy app uses the scientifically-proven method of spaced retrieval training to help people with dementia or other memory impairments to recall important information. Recalling an answer over multiplying intervals of time, such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 8 minutes, and so on, helps to cement the information in memory.\n\nSpaced Retrieval Therapy is an enhanced interval timer with independent data tracking and prompts. It automatically increases the time between prompts with correct responses and decreases it with incorrect ones. This app will help clinicians, family members, and students keep track of the intervals and performance as they practice up to 3 memory targets.\n\n*Put away your stopwatch and paper - this app is all you need!\n\n*Keeps track of expanding intervals and data so you don't have to\n\n*Works in the background while doing other therapy exercises or using other apps\n\n*Subtle sound and visual prompts let you know it’s time to ask again\n\n*Tracks accuracy and data automatically, & emails you the finished report\n\n\n\"5 Stars - This app is a fantastic inclusion into my therapy toolbox. It is very useful in therapy and helps me keep track patient progress more efficiently.\" - App Store Review\n\n\nSpeech-Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Neuropsychologists, Teachers, Social Workers, and families can all use this simple technique & app to help clients and loved ones remember important information (names, safety procedures, orientation information, etc).\n\nRecommended by top experts in memory training and dementia therapy, Spaced Retrieval Therapy will make your life easier and your therapy more efficient.\n\n\n\"***** Very Useful!  I found this app to be extremely useful during therapy sessions. When juggling multiple activities it can be difficult to remember to cue a patient for each specific interval. This app makes spaced retrieval an easy way to incorporate prospective and short term memory tasks into treatment.\" - SLP on App Store Review\n\n\nVisit our website at http://tactustherapy.com/app/srt/ to link to several articles about this technique and its proven efficacy with dementia, aphasia, normal learners, and more. \n\n\nThis app is also available as part of the Tactus Complete Therapy Toolkit and Tactus Cognitive Therapy Toolkit discount bundles for iPad users.\n\n\nPlease note: This app is a timer and tracks data.  Targets should be individually selected for the memory-impaired person to be relevant and meaningful.  This app is not intended to be used alone by the memory-impaired person, but as a therapy tool by a clinician or family member trained in this technique."

      "label": "Cobb method is considered the standard for measuring curve size in scoliosis. Cobb angles are always measured from the superior end plate of the most cephalad end vertebra to the inferior end plate of the most caudal end vertebra in the curve.  Meticulous line drawings and precise measurements is paramount importance in order to quantify the magnitude of spinal deformities and monitor the success or failure of treatment for scoliosis.  \nThe CobbAngleApp is medical software aimed for orthopaedic surgeons, providing tools that allow doctors to:\n-Securely import medical images directly from the camera or stored photos. \n-Offers a very convenient way to determine the most accurate possibly way at once. By marking four points at the same X-ray, at each spine the App calculates the Cobb angle. In cases where values are out of normal ranges, the scoliosis is categorized according to  measured angle as mild, moderate, severe. To simplify the process and to minimize inter-observer errors usually by not selecting the actual end vertebra, the app offers also in ext mode the ability to draw the vertical reference line through the patient’s sacrum and to identify more easily the end vertebrae s (ext method).\n-Save the planned images, the measured values and results compared by normal reference databases, for later review or consultation.\n-The app also is independent from errors produced by image inclination. Especially developed module allows the user to measure accurately without to worry about the tilting of the picture or the X-ray.\n\n     All information received from the software output must be clinically reviewed regarding its plausibility before patient treatment!  CobbAngleApp indicated for assisting healthcare professionals. Clinical judgment and experience are required to properly use the software. The software is not for primary image interpretation. \n\n     In a busy everyday practice, the examiner have to draw lines  in X-rays  or in clinical settings, this it is time consuming and cumbersome. Accessory instruments like protractors, hinged goniometers, well sharp pencils, rulers or even transparent papers must be available. The app offers a very convenient and also accurate way to perform most common radiographic measurements for spine, in a blink of an eye in front of your  screen. The build in feature of the app, allows results to be  categorized may help decide what could be considered normal or pathologic.\nThe app is not a simple goniometer, is an enhanced product which helps to monitor objectively the course of the treatment and evaluate optimally the spine. This App is particular useful especially in clinical settings where you need a quick results without losing time.

      "label": "SleepCheck is more than a sleep or snore recorder, it assesses your risk of sleep apnoea by analysing your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. \n\n**Why should I take the test?**\nSleep apnoea (or apnea) is a serious medical condition that can have a major impact on your life. If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected. No account setup required. - \n\nYour sleep recording never leaves your iPhone. Once analysed, it is deleted. \n\nYour age, gender, sleep duration and risk assessment will be collected by ResApp Health and used to improve our products and services. This will not include any data that will identify you. To find out more, please read our privacy policy.\n\nFor use on adults aged 18 years and above.\n\nAlways read and follow the Instructions before Use.

The exercises are designed to be repeatable and engaging.\n\nThe automatic tracking and reporting feature makes it easy for parents, teachers and occupational therapists to identify time on task and progress.  You can email the progress reports right from the app itself.\n\nMulti-user tracking is available as an in-app purchase.

As a result, the capacity of oxygen saturation increases, which will help reduce the anxiety.\n\nIn addition, this app has a 'PANIC BUTTON' that will automatically introduce you to breathing during an acute state of anxiety and quickly help you slow down breathing and consequently stop the panic attack. It is useful to do this exercise in any state of anxiety, so as to ease your breathing and reduce hyperventilation.\n\nThese exercises are also RECOMMENDED TO SPORTSPEOPLE  as they balance the breathing rhythm and increase lung capacity.\n\nRecord your exercises so you can TRACK YOUR PROGRESS in improving the breathing rhythm and decreasing the frequency of anxiety episodes."

      "label": "The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator is based on ERSPC, Rotterdam, data and supported by the Prostate Cancer Research Foundation, Rotterdam (SWOP)\n \n \nThe Prostate Cancer Research Foundation, Rotterdam, Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Prostaatkanker (SWOP), is an initiative of the Department of Urology of the Erasmus MC, the University and Medical Centre of Rotterdam, in The Netherlands. Its goal is the financial support of scientific research projects in the field of prostate cancer, as well as other cancers of the urinary tract.\nPlease be aware that the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS cannot be 100% accurate at predicting the presence or absence of prostate cancer. It is designed to help calculate your risk, not give a definitive diagnosis.\nThe Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS provides a general risk calculation based on your PSA level and other information.\nWhile knowing your PSA level is helpful, the decision to have a PSA test has to be taken seriously after weighing up all factors and discussing the implications with your GP or hospital doctor.\nIt is possible that prostate cancer will not be found even if you have an elevated PSA. However, it may be present even if your PSA level is low.\nYour doctor may want to take further tests. If you have doubts or questions about your health, you should always contact your GP or hospital doctor. This is particularly important if you have questions which arise from the use of our prostate cancer risk calculator.\nIt cannot be ruled out that the way the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS is used, or the indications given by it, are interpreted in a manner that is not appropriate. The creators of the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS do not accept any responsibility in any respect.\nThe European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer has published its 11-year follow-up results (New England Journal of Medicine, March 15 2012). Once again, they demonstrate that screening does significantly reduce death from prostate cancer. The latest study confirms that a man who undergoes PSA testing will have his risk of dying from prostate cancer reduced by 29%.\nERSPC is the world’s largest randomized prostate cancer screening study. It was designed to investigate whether early detection and treatment of prostate cancer might reduce disease-specific mortality and also help to identify men at risk. From 1992, the ERSPC study randomized 162,000 men, aged 55 to 69, across Europe to either a screening arm or a control group.\n\nDesigned and developed for iOS by Nuno Azevedo of Ydeal.net Software LDA"

      "label": "Dose Chex is designed to simplify the calculations required when administering drugs and fluids. Rather than performing drug calculations manually, Dose Chex performs them for you. It is fast and reliable, and won’t be affected by working a long shift!\n\nData entry is kept the a minimum so there is no excuse for failing to double-check drug doses before administering them.\n\nThe app can be configured to suit the needs of your working environment. The concentrations in the suspensions and critical care sections can edited and concentrations stored for future use. The default units for each data item can be set to match you needs.\n\nWhy is Dose Chex required? Errors in the administration of medications are commonplace and can result in significant harm to patients. The 2009 NPSA report ‘Safety in Doses’ identified 72,482 medication incident reports in one year. Of these 100 had resulted in death or severe harm. In addition, such errors can have a significant effect on the person administering the medication\n\nIn acute care settings there can be many distractions, making it difficult to concentrate on the often complex calculations required when administering medicines. Removing as many potential points of human error helps make the process safer."

The decision to use this advice must be made by the supervising doctor, and cannot be used to replace clinical judgement.\n\nThis application is  based on the experience gained when providing anaesthetic care to over 1,000 patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. It was developed during a clinical trial entitled \"A Heuristic Approach to determine the optimal method of Heparin Dosing and Reversal in all Patients Undergoing Anaesthesia for Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation (CA-AF)\", ANZCTR  Trial Id: ACTRN12618001489280 (https://www.anzctr.org.au) and approved by the Ramsay Human Ethics Committee: Clinical trial number 18/38 9th October 2019.\n\nIt can be used to estimate the initial bolus of heparin needed to achieve a desired ACT, given height, weight, sex, ACT before heparin and desired ACT.\nThe ACT must then be measured ten minutes after the inital heparin bolus and the result entered into the application in order to calculate the patient's individual ACT:heparin dose-response relationship. \n\nThis timing is essential for accuracy of subsequent calculations and is critically important.\n\nThe application learns  as each new patient is added. After the first ten patients, accuracy for the intial heprin dose to achieve the desired ACT moves toward the 86% mark. There will, of course, be outliers.  The application allows for dose adjustments based on the measured ACT. Estimates of the protamine dose needed to reverse heparin in the context of catheter ablation cases has been shown to be 97% accurate.\n\nThis software is NOT intended by its manufacturer to: \n(a)     be used for the sole purpose of providing alerts to health professionals in relation to patient care; and\n(b)    \n        (i)\treplace the clinical judgement of a health professional; or\n       (ii)\tdiagnose, screen for, prevent, alleviate, treat, or make a decision about the treatment of, a disease, condition, ailment or defect\n\nAs each patient has details added, the application moves toward the average for the initial heparin dose calculations, but always uses the individual patient response to heparin to estimate the appropriate change in heparin bolus to achieve the desired ACT.\n\nWhile this application helps guide the administration, maintenance and reversal of heparin, it is important to note that a normal ACT does not necessarily mean that there is no residual heparin, and does not mean that there is not an excess of protamine after reversal of heparin.\n\nIt is up to the individual practitioner to use their best judgment when using this application. It is not intended to replace clinical judgement by experience operators. For example, a protamine: heparin ratio of 0.8 to 1 may be considered optimal by some practitioners, but others may prefer the traditional 1:1 ratio.\n\nThe heparin image is taken from Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1034324 \n\nInformation and links to citations forming the basis for the theoretical development of this app can be found at: https://HeparinHeuristics.com"

      "label": "The way we think determines both how we feel and how we behave. The way we think about ourselves, other people and our place in the world has a direct influence on our emotional state and our behaviour. Consequently by changing the way we think we can positively influence our mood and how we respond to situations.  This is the premise behind Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which has become the most effective psychological treatment available for a range of emotional and behavioural problems including depression and anxiety. \n\nA thought diary is designed to help people record and change the thoughts that cause emotional and psychological distress. The Thought Diary Pro is the advanced version of the Thought Diary, and allows the  identification of thinking errors (also known as 'cognitive distortions'), and the the modification of our unhelpful thoughts into more productive ways of thinking. By challenging the thoughts and beliefs that cause discontentment, dissatisfaction and other emotional and behavioural distress, we can improve our mental health and can change the destructive or adverse behaviours we may engage in as a result of our negative thoughts. \n\nThought Diary Pro is designed to be the second step in changing our thinking patterns by helping individuals identify the thinking errors that they engage in, and thereby helping change these thoughts. The effect of modifying these thought can reduce the negative emotional and behavioural consequences of experiencing these negative thoughts. Similar to the Thought Diary, the Pro version was designed by an experienced clinical psychologist and CBT therapist who believed that these tools should be available in the most accessible form for individuals to use in today’s fast technological world. It can be used by people either in therapy as a useful adjunct to the treatment, and there is a feature that allows the Thought Diary to be emailed straight to their therapist. However, it can also be used by those individuals who are embarking on a self-guided course of CBT."

As such, the TSRA has assembled a catalog of educational materials for residents and fellows embarking on the arduous course of training. This app is the newest member of that catalog and allows the user to test their knowledge base by answering multiple choice questions in the major disciplines associated with thoracic surgery: adult cardiac surgery, congenital cardiac surgery, general thoracic surgery, and trauma and critical care. Each of the four disciplines is subdivided into important categories with approximately 10 questions per subject. The user selects the best answer and is immediately notified if their choice was correct. The notification contains the correct answer and, usually, an explanation for the correct answer and the incorrect options. Answered questions are stored on the device as either answered correctly or answered incorrectly, providing the user the opportunity to review their previous attempts. Questions can be reset to allow the user to repeat the questions as needed.\n\nTSRA resources are provided as a basic guideline for the study of cardiothoracic surgery and should be used in conjunction with a variety of other educational references and resources.

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

      "label": "Taking the deaf world by storm and featured in the news, Deafwake was created by a deaf person and is designed to ensure everyone can get up when they’re supposed to. Removing the risk of sleeping in and being late for meetings, it allows deaf individuals or heavy sleepers to be on time, every time. \n\nDeaf Wake, an LED / Vibration / Visual based alarm app for people who are deaf, hearing Impaired or just want a really cool alarm clock.\n\nThis deaf app will be your best friend as well as your worse enemy (if you don't like being woken up) It is designed to utilise all the senses of your iPhone. It has a flashing screen, it vibrates, it uses the camera flash and is loud.\n\nThe app has hit all four corners of the globe, including the UK, USA, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Denmark, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, and Mexico. And with more than 1,000 downloads on the App Store, and over 500,000 Facebook users reached, the app has proven to be a huge hit with those who struggle daily with the realities of being deaf or hard of hearing. \n\nSee video of app in action - https://www.facebook.com/deafwake/#\n\n*********************\n\nThe App has an easy interface where you can select the camera flash, have a flashing screen, have it vibrate or use sound. You may select one or two or even use all the senses of your iPhone.\n\nNot all senses may be appropriate for every scenario for an example during a work meeting you may not want the phone to rudely interrupt you by sound or vibration. A discreet flashing screen telling you that your child needs to be picked up from nursery may be more appropriate.\n\n*********************\n\nBe Alert /////\nNever be late again. Never burn the Sunday roast. Never miss meetings. All because you didn't hear the phone (or didn't feel it vibrating)\n\nChoose Your Senses /////\nChoose the flashing screen. Just have the phone vibrate. Set the camera flash. Be alerted by sound. Or have all four turned on.\n\nDescriptive Alarms /////\nUniquely give each alarm setting a description. A description could be 'Make your partner a cup of tea to get out of the doghouse'\n\nMade By A Deaf Person /////\nAn app designed by a hearing impaired person with deaf people in mind (or just plain heavy sleepers)\n\nApple Watch /////\nThe App is also designed to work with the Apple Watch. You can use the Apple Watch to also set your alarms as well as other features.\n\nChoose Clock Interfaces /////\nChoose from a selection of two clock faces. Simply swipe left or right. You may prefer an easier analogue clock.\n\n*********************\n\nNo longer do you have to put the phone under your pillow or in your pocket in order to (hopefully) be woken up. At night put the iPhone at the side of the bed and let it flash to wake you up (using the flashing screen and camera flash). Put the iPhone on the kitchen table whilst chopping carrots to remind you to take the roast out of the oven. Settle down, watch a movie and let the App tell you when its time to go to bed.\n\n*********************\n\nAs a long life deaf person I have been frustrated with the lack of innovation designed for deaf people in technology. One problem I have had is a suitable alarm clock or timer that appropriately notifies me. This App was born out of frustration and was initially just developed for my own personal use.\n\nSteven Mifsud\nDeafWake Designer \n\n*********************\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK - https://www.facebook.com/deafwake\n\nWhat are you waiting for!\n\nGet this superb app today\n\nFor less than a price of coffee, download this App today and be amazed!

      "label": "Squeezy CF has been reviewed, supported and endorsed by the CF Trust.\n\nIt is recognised that one impact of the exercise recommendations and airway clearance techniques for individuals with Cystic Fibrosis is that the pelvic floor can be put under strain, leading to pelvic floor dysfunction such as stress incontinence. This can happen to men and women, although it is more common in women. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can help to prevent and treat these problems, reducing pelvic floor, bladder and bowel symptoms and supporting the active lifestyle that is important for general health.\n\nSqueezy CF has been designed by chartered physiotherapists specialising in Pelvic Health working in the NHS. It is suitable for everyone who wants to do pelvic floor muscle exercises (also called Kegel exercises). The app is particularly aimed at those who are seeing a specialist physiotherapist for problems connected to their bladder, bowels or pelvic floor muscles as it can be tailored to a specific exercise programme and set to remind you when to do your exercises. It is simple to use, discreet, informative and has helpful visual and audio prompts to support your exercise programme plus it maintains a record of the number of exercises you have completed.\n\nFeatures:\n • Apple Watch support! Be extra discrete, squeeze from your watch\n • Customisable exercise plan\n • “Professional mode” to help physiotherapists set detailed exercise plans for patients\n • Visual, and audio guides for exercises\n • Information and tips written by professional Pelvic Health physiotherapists\n • Track and monitor your progress\n • Write a short note after a completed exercise\n • Simple and clear interface"

The six parameters are:\n- Respiratory rate\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Systolic blood pressure\n- Pulse rate\n- Level of consciousness\n- Temperature\n\nA score is allocated to each parameter during measurement. A larger score means the parameter varies more from normal levels.\n\nNEWS2 Calculator has options to colour code the controls based on their value (for example, when changing the value of a parameter which would give a score of 3, the control turns red). The colours are based upon the NEWS2 chart which healthcare workers are already familiar with, making NEWS2 Calculator extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThere is also an option for alerts to appear which provide further guidance for healthcare workers on the best course of action to take, based upon the NEWS or NEWS2 score which was calculated.\n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application has been designed to assist pre-hospital, community and hospital clinicians to calculate a National Early Warning Score for patients who are unwell.

A text label above the timer will inform you if there is still a '24 hour time frame' in progress and the app will inform you that doses cannot be given if reached a Max Dose within this time frame.  A Notification will also be set to your device to inform you that the 24 hour time frame is finished for each specific child.  (Please make sure you have Notifications turned on in iPhone Settings - Notifications - Child Meds   for this to work).\n\n\n• Record Temperature: \nYou can record the child's temperature at the point of administering the medication.  \nA popup prompt will ask you each time you press the 'Start timing' button in the app.\n• No temperature reading at this time? ... Just tap on the temperature box to enter manually, this will also add details to the Log.\n• The temperature label will give a colour coding depending on the entered temperature -- Green, Orange and Red indicating on severity of the temperature.\n\n\n• Dose History Log:\nHistorical Log of child's name and doses given on dates and times will be saved on your device to review at a later date.\nWhen entering a temperature manually, this will also be indicated as such with a time and date stamp to let you know when it was entered.\n\nJust for children?  - Why not use it for yourself or other adults too!"

If you have sleep apnoea, air stops flowing to your lungs for ten seconds or longer during sleep. In some cases, this can happen more than 30 times per hour all night. \n\nSleep apnoea affects more than three in every ten men, and nearly two in every ten women. Studies have shown that 80% of people with sleep apnoea are undiagnosed. \n\n**How the SleepCheck app works**\nSleepCheck records your breathing and snoring sounds while you sleep. SleepCheck then uses clinically proven machine-learning algorithms to assess your risk of sleep apnoea. \n\nIn just a few steps, you can find out if there is more to your snore.\n\n1.\tMake sure you are the only person sleeping in the room\n2.\tAnswer a few questions on your age, gender and neck size\n3.\tBefore you sleep, place your phone on your bedside table, press record and go to sleep\n4.\tWhen you wake up, stop the recording \n5.\tSee your results and understand next steps\n\n- Your privacy and data is protected.

      "label": "****Thank you for making us a TOP 25 App in US, UK and Canada App Store category specific rankings!****\n\nSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a kind of depression that appears at certain times of the year. Light therapy is one of the potential treatments for this condition. Almost 80% of the people who try light therapy find it beneficial. This app converts your apple device into a light box.\n\nWhy you SHOULD NOT download this App:\n1. If you are looking for a SAD Light Box App that generates an intensity of 10,000 Lux\n2. If you are looking for a quick fix and can not commit to consistent morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks\n3. If you will get turned off by the simplicity of this app and the solution to Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nWhy you SHOULD download this App:\n1. If you want to try a cheap yet effective alternative to a traditional Light box which uses lower intensity BLUE LIGHT (approx. 100 to 575 Lux) and is backed by research (Google research paper: The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in sub-syndromal seasonal affective disorder by NCBI, US National Library of Medicine)\n2. If you would rather be intelligent and try something for a fiver rather than spend a few hundred dollars on a conventional light box\n3. If you are able to consistently commit to regular morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks \n4. If you would be happy with a REALLY SIMPLE APP that transforms your Apple device into a Light box and is more portable and user friendly\n5. If the weather is making you sad :( and you would rather be happy :)\n     \nThis app can also help you:\n1. Determine if you are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/ Cabin Fever/ Winter Blues/ Seasonal Depression with help of a short scored test\n2. Create your own unique shade of Blue / White / any other color light that works best for you\n3. Use the app as a Dawn Simulator (set alarm)\n4. Set timer for your light box to time your morning exposure sessions\n5. Shop for other products to help with SAD\n6. Listen to the Radio in the background\n\nUV Rating: The UV emission from your Apple Device is 0, hence this app does not have a UV rating. \n\nSome other activities you might want to try to deal with symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder are:\n• End your morning shower with a cold shower\n• Try to arrange the spaces you spend time in to maximize sunlight exposure\n• Keep curtains open during the day\n• Trim tree branches or hedges that may be blocking some of the light from getting into your home\n• Move furniture so that you sit near a window or, if you exercise indoors, set up your exercise equipment by a window\n• Install skylights and add lamps\n• Build physical activity into your lifestyle preferably before SAD symptoms take hold. Physical activity relieves stress, builds energy and increases both your physical and mental well-being and resilience\n• Make a habit of taking a daily noon-hour walk, particularly if you commute to school or work in the dark hours of the day\n• Meditate at least 20 min a day (focus on your breathing)\n• Try High intensity training if you are fit enough and have less time\n• Maintain good sleep hygiene\n• When all else fails, try a winter vacation in sunny climates—if the pocket and work schedule allow. Keep in mind that the symptoms will recur after you return home\n\nREFUND POLICY: If you consistently use the App for 14 days and show us that you genuinely tried but did not get any results, WE WILL REFUND 100% OF YOUR MONEY. *Subject to terms and conditions of Apple Inc. and the Apple App Store.\n\nSmile, because somewhere far away, we are cheering for you :)\n\n*THIS APP MUST NOT BE USED TO SUBSTITUTE ANY MEDICATION/ MEDICAL DEVICE. THE CREATORS/ PUBLISHERS OF THIS APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING AS A USE OF THIS APP. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES. NO PART OF THIS DESCRIPTION OR APP MUST BE CONSIDERED AS MEDICAL ADVICE*"

      "label": "Anyone who snores at night is usually exhausted and not well rested the next morning. But not only that, the (spouse) partner is also prevented from sleeping because of the noise. \n\nMost of the time you will be confronted with the words: \"I have to fall asleep before you, otherwise you will start snoring and I won't be able to sleep.\" \n\nSnoring can thus become a real test of patience and there are even said to be cases where partners are no longer (able to) sleep in the same room.\n\nAlthough the number of men who snore is higher, there are also many women who snore. Therefore, this problem affects all genders.\n\nThere are several possible remedies on the market. But not all of them deliver what they promise, are expensive or very unwieldy.\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is an anti-snoring solution that works through a completely \"natural\" concept. \n\nIn the past, did your partner, with a (gentle) nudge, make you change your sleeping position to stop snoring?\n\nThis practice is a common method between many couples in bed to stop the other from snoring. \n\nThis approach often serves its purpose. However, it is usually the case that both are awake at night and then have to fall asleep again. \n\nOur Anti-Snore-App automatically fulfills exactly this purpose without anyone having to wake up for it.  \n\nAfter a short orientation period, our Silent Night app promises you: \n\n- restful and regenerative sleep for everyone involved\n- reduced disturbance of the partner's rest\n- improved oxygen intake due to the shifting of the body\n\nOur app uses state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of machine learning. We use it to evaluate your current sleeping sounds and provide you with unconscious assistance through vibrations. \n\nOf course, your data remains completely recorded on the device and will be deleted immediately after evaluation. This means that not only your restful sleep but also the protection of your data is in the forefront.\n\nLikewise, all processes operate directly on the device, data and radio connections can be independently deactivated by you (recommended!) overnight.\n\n----\nDisclaimer for medical services\n\nThis Anti-Snore-App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice and/or diagnoses. The Anti-Snore-App is not intended to diagnose or treat respiratory failure or other diseases/medical conditions. Please consult a licensed physician before making any decisions or taking any actions that may affect your health, safety and well-being. Do not ignore professional advice based on things you have seen, heard or read on the app, website or social media. Always consult a healthcare professional if you have questions or concerns about your snoring or overall health."

      "label": "The way we think determines both how we feel and how we behave. The way we think about ourselves, other people and our place in the world has a direct influence on our emotional state and our behaviour. Consequently by changing the way we think we can positively influence our mood and how we respond to situations.  This is the premise behind Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) which has become the most effective psychological treatment available for a range of emotional and behavioural problems including depression and anxiety. \n\nA thought diary is designed to help people record the thoughts that cause emotional and psychological distress. By recording our unhelpful thoughts, we can learn to identify thinking errors (also known as ‘negative’, ‘automatic’ or ‘dysfunctional’ thoughts). It is a common tool used in CBT to assist individuals in identifying unhelpful thinking patterns, which will then provide the opportunity to challenge and change these thoughts and thereby reducing psychological distress.  \n\nThis Thought Diary is designed to be the first step in changing our thoughts by helping individuals identify the trigger situations for their negative thoughts and the emotional and behavioural consequences of experiencing these negative thoughts. It was designed by an experienced clinical psychologist and CBT therapist who believed that these tools should be available in the most accessible form for individuals to use in today’s fast technological world. It can be used by people either in therapy as a useful adjunct to the treatment, and there is a feature that allows the Thought Diary to be emailed straight to their therapist. However, it can also be used by those individuals who are embarking on a self-guided course of CBT.\n\nWhen the Thought Diary is emailed it takes the traditional format of a CBT thought record.\n\nHow to Use:\nThe Thought Diary should be used when you experience a negative emotional state or engage in unhelpful or self destructive behaviour (Consequences). \n\nStep one: record what you were doing and where you were at that time (date, time and situation). This can help identify whether there is a particular pattern present in the emotional distress or behaviour problem. \n\nStep two:  note down what you were thinking at the time (thought), and how much you believed this thought (belief rating). The belief rating is useful to determine the degree to which we believe the thoughts, and can indicate whether the conviction in these thoughts changes when we challenge these thoughts in the next step of CBT. \n\nStep three: record how you felt and what you did in response (consequences). It can sometimes be easier to write down the consequences as the first step as they are primary indicators of distress, and then work through the other categories. There are usually both emotional and behavioural consequences, and sometime another thinking pattern is activated which is why we have provided a category for ‘thoughts’. \n\nHowever, it may not be necessary to complete all these categories in the consequences step if only emotional and/or behavioural disturbance is obvious."

      "label": "ObWheel is a handy app that puts the traditional pregnancy dates wheel into the palm of your hand! ObWheel is useful for expectant parents as well as obstetricians, family physicians, nurses, midwives, and students. It uses the date of Last Menstrual Period (LMP) to calculate Estimated Due Date (EDD) and Gestational Age (GA). No more imprecise paper wheels - this tool is always at hand, in your pocket!\n\nWe've separated the outer and inner wheels to make this easy-to-use. Spin the green wheel to set the LMP date. Spin the purple wheel to browse important milestones, and to calculate the gestational age on a specific date (displayed in the middle).\n\nPrefer to enter dates manually? No problem. Select \"Set\" and choose dates by LMP, EDD, or GA on a specific date. Use the \"Info\" screen to see important dates (trimesters, testing and windows) and information on fetal biometry reference ranges (Lessoway) based on current gestational age.\n\nNeed to calculate the EDD from a dating ultrasound report? Rotate the purple wheel until the GA shown matches the GA on the ultrasound report. Then, rotate the green wheel until the date matches the date of the ultrasound. The EDD will be displayed below. Alternatively, input the GA and ultrasound date manually in the \"Set\" screen.\n\nObWheel is a universal app and works on the iPhone and iPad! We are continually working to improve ObWheel, and appreciate your feedback."

      "label": "Choose This not That for Fatty Liver. Inside this colorful app, you will find easy to follow suggestions on how to improve your health through nutrition and the food choices you make every day. This app provides comprehensive and actionable nutrition guidelines for how to reduce your risk, prevent and combat Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, its symptoms and complications.\r\n\r\nRecent research shows that there are a number of nutrients and natural food items that play a significant role in dealing with NAFLD. If you rather tackle health issues and risks through proper nutrition and lifestyle changes then this app is for you!\r\n\r\nA number of powerful, unique and interactive features make this app so different and superior to others in the market:\r\n\r\n• Separate dietary guidance for NAFLD AND its combination with the following most likely health issues: diabetes type 2, excess weight or obesity, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, metabolic syndrome, PCOS, prediabetes and stress. \r\n\r\n• Is this food good for me? This feature answers the common question if a food of your choice is helpful or harmful to your personal situation. And it does so in an easy to understand and colorful graphic form.\r\n\r\n• Top-5 recommendations on what to eat/do, and what not to.\r\n\r\n• Food Suggestions. The best food choices within a food group, based on your personal profile. An extremely valuable tool when at restaurants or when grocery shopping. Over 850 natural food items and growing number of recipes are included. \r\n\r\n• Suggestions on appropriate life style choices, alternative therapies and herbal remedies, when such options are promising and available to you.\r\n\r\n• ACTIONABLE information on what is good, what is bad, and what is neutral for your condition(s). We don't just point you to a food group. We single out specific food items, and give you an ordered list of helpful and harmful foods within each food group. \r\n\r\nThe primary sources used by this app are US government agencies such as USDA, NIH (National Institute of Health), PubMed, and leading clinics & universities.\r\n\r\nPersonal Remedies is the producer of the world's first e-dietitian and publisher of the largest collection of health and nutrition apps for chronic conditions. Based in metro-Boston, home to the highest ranking healthcare providers and academic institutions in the world.\r\n\r\nThis app is updated by our team on an ongoing basis. Updates happen seamlessly, and do NOT require frequent inconvenient downloads.\r\n\r\n“This technology was developed using the most current clinical evidence-based information that is available in the US. Behind this technology there is a team of expert clinicians, scientists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and other specialists who are passionate about bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the patient.“ \r\nKatya Tsaioun, PhD, Nutrition, Tufts University; L.D.N.\r\n\r\n“Proper nutrition and other alternative treatments show great promise in preventing and treating many of the illnesses that we deal with every day. I encourage all my patients to follow appropriate nutrition and research other options for themselves. The Choose This Not That series are an excellent step towards improving people’s knowledge in this area.”\r\nShahin Tabatabaei, MD\r\nMass General Hospital; Harvard Medical School\r\n\r\n“The Choose This Not That series of apps provide dietary recommendations focused on common chronic health problems. They are easy to understand and thus easy to implement into daily life. Most doctors would find it difficult to discuss dietary recommendations at the level of detail found in the series. They should serve as a valuable complement in helping people manage chronic illnesses through dietary and lifestyle modifications.”\r\nAndrew S. Lenhardt, MD \r\nLahey Clinic, Beverly, MA"

The Pulse Oximetry app brings together all the features you need to effectively monitor respiratory conditions, with many more powerful features and functions to come.\n\nThe app is designed to help manage your respiratory health needs by providing easy to understand data visualizations and comprehensive reviews. Connect a compatible Bluetooth pulse oximeter of your choice[1]. The app supports 50 different pulse oximeter models with support for more in coming updates, including spot check only devices. Now using a different pulse oximeter doesn't mean having to lose all your data when switching to a different app. Switch between compatible pulse oximeters at anytime and all your data is kept in the same powerful app. You can even export your data to Apple's Health app[2].\n\nHere are just some of the features the Pulse Oximetry app has to offer:\n- A monitor view with all measured information in clear view\n- Detailed line graph views for every measured parameter\n- Alarm settings and indications that go beyond a simple tone\n- Data recording for periods of 2 minutes up to 10 hours in 1 second intervals\n- Select a light or dark app theme color\n- Customizable date/time formats for compatibility with international standards\n- Connect to Apple’s Health app[2]\n- Detailed history and record reviews\n- Flag important measurements for future reference\n- Custom history date range to focus on the data of interest\n\nTo review all the features and functions available go to:\nhttps://www.appinlights.com/pulseoximetry/\n\nIMPORTANT!\nThis app is neither certified nor approved by any regulatory agency, and shall not be used for medical diagnosis. All information provided shall only be used for education, instruction or research. Alarm conditions experienced while monitoring or recording shall not be considered medical emergencies, but it is recommended that any alarm condition be given attention to ensure the safety of the person being monitored. The Pulse Oximetry app does not collect personal identifiable information.\n\n[1] The app requires a compatible Bluetooth pulse oximeter to perform measurements. Bluetooth pulse oximeters are sold separately. For a complete list of supported devices go to https://www.appinlights.com/pulseoximetry/supported-devices.html\n\n[2] The app supports exporting SpO2, heart rate, perfusion index and respiratory rate to Apple’s Health app.\n\n**Note: The app can be installed on 3rd Generation and newer iPads, but because the screens of these devices have a 4:3 aspect ratio, as opposed to a 16:9 aspect ratio of compatible devices, the app is not guaranteed to look or function correctly on iPads."

A detailed manual with 14 chapters is an ideal companion if you are a medical student, radiology resident, radiographer, a medic on the ward or preparing for board exams. It teaches the beginner (and perhaps not so much of a beginner) the technique of interpreting a chest radiograph. Over 70 flash cards on specific conditions provide short and succinct information, ideal when that odd looking film shows up on the screen. Unlike a traditional book, each condition is provided with multiple example images for better understanding.\n\nThanks to the beautiful high resolution screen, iCXR virtually turns your device to a mini PACS work station. Zoom the image by using familiar pinch gestures, use built in tools to change contrast and brightness and invert the image for a near real life experience. Over 100 detailed pictorial and text annotations superimposed on the images help better understanding. You can turn off the annotations to appreciate the findings better.\n\niCXR – The modern chest radiograph reference.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Works on both iPhone and iPad with a single purchase\n \n- No internet connection required\n\n- Largest chest radiograph library on the iphone \n\n- High quality zoomable radiographs\n\n- Zoomable text and pictorial annotations overlaid on the image that can be toggled\n\n- Multiple examples per condition\n\n- Links from text to appropriate images\n\n- Image manipulation tools that simulate a PACS work station\n\n- Manual to teach chest radiograph interpretation\n\n- Flash cards for quick reference"

The concentrations in the suspensions and critical care sections can edited and concentrations stored for future use. The default units for each data item can be set to match you needs.\n\nWhy is Dose Chex required? Errors in the administration of medications are commonplace and can result in significant harm to patients. The 2009 NPSA report ‘Safety in Doses’ identified 72,482 medication incident reports in one year. Of these 100 had resulted in death or severe harm. In addition, such errors can have a significant effect on the person administering the medication\n\nIn acute care settings there can be many distractions, making it difficult to concentrate on the often complex calculations required when administering medicines. Removing as many potential points of human error helps make the process safer."

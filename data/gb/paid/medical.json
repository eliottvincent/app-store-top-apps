      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

Optionally, you can download all patients’ details for a client, rather than just the patients you have an appointment to see, as well as use the online search to make appointments for patients not already in the app.\n\nThis enables you to write clinical notes, book products and services manually or by scanning bar codes, and attach photo assets during your visit at a client's site, rather than waiting until you return to practice, saving you time and additional effort.\n\nOnce you have connectivity, you can synchronise your work back into the VetIT PMS.\n\nOther features of VetIT OTR:\n\n- View client and patient locations.\n- View directions and the map to clients and patients using GPS on your device.\n- View client and patient alerts.\n- View a breakdown of the current client balance.\n- Call or send an SMS to a client.\n- Take photos to support clinical histories.\n- Make new appointments on your device.\n- Update the status of appointments as your day progresses and receive new appointments to your mobile device (When connected to a data network).\n- View the price breakdown of products and services including Price Profiles.\n- View assets attached to the patient’s clinical history (When connected to a data network)."

      "label": "* The world's number 1 DAF app is used by thousands of people in over one hundred countries. *\n\nDAF Professional has been created to help people who stammer or have a neurological disease such as Parkinson's Disease. It helps people to slow their rate of speech which makes it clearer to others.\n\nDAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.\n\nDAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT). DAF Professional delivers incredibly low latency feedback even when running in the background.\n\nDelayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly. However, until recently, devices have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used.\n\nDAF was originally developed for people who stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010).\n\nIt works by enabling someone to hear his or her own speech in an altered manner. This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups however DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions.\n\nWhen using Bluetooth devices there is an additional delay of 60ms added to the feedback system.\n\nIf you do use a Bluetooth headset you may find you need to turn the bluetooth device on after opening the app to enable it.\n\nDAF Professional works when put in the background or the screen is turned off. Like all apps of this type, it can NOT work during phone calls or with other media apps playing at the same time.\n\nIf you wish to provide any feedback we would be delighted to hear from you. Please email us at support@speechtools.co.\n\nOur lead Speech and Language Therapist is Samantha Brady who qualified as a Speech and Language Therapist in 2001 (PGDip, City University) and gained her Masters in Speech and Language Therapy in 2006 (MSc, City University). She has a wealth of experience of working as a Speech and Language Therapist in a variety of settings and her area of clinical expertise is adult neurology and voice. Samantha is a member of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT), HPC Registered (SL10250) and Lee Silverman Voice Treatment Certified (LSVT).\n\nDAF Professional is fully GDPR compliant and will not collect any of your data without first asking for your consent."

The smaller iPad versions are manageable though you will probably require two hands to hold it.\n\nToday’s New Idea is a “not for profit” business which means all proceeds from the sale of this app go toward the development of this app and other apps we hope users will find educational or beneficial."

      "label": "ClaroCom is an iPad or iPhone App for AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication). ClaroCom helps to replace speech for those with impairments in the production of spoken language. ClaroCom is suitable for children or adults with some or full literacy, and can assist users who have limited or no speech and language difficulties.\n\nPRODUCT FEATURES\n\n• Writing\nType into the Message Window using the on-screen keyboard. Press the Speak button to have text in the Message Window spoken. ClaroCom can also speak each word as it is typed or inserted into the Message Window.\nText in the Message Window is spoken using the human quality in-built voices.\nCommunicate remotely with ClaroCom Pro. Text in the Message Window can be sent by Message and Mail and sent to Facebook and Twitter, as well as copied into other apps.\nUse the built in Word Prediction and Phrase Prediction to speed up writing. \nCreate text using the phrase banks to find a phrase. ClaroCom is loaded with some standard phrases. More phrases can be added and history is stored of what is typed.\nRotate or flip the iOS device and ClaroCom Pro will shows only the message to be communicated in large text the correct way up, perfect when communicating privately. Tipping the iPhone or iPad back reverts the screen back to normal.\n**NEW** Link & chat to iOS device - connect your device to any other device that is also using ClaroCom Pro.  You can then chat between the devices using the text that you type or words or phrases that you select.  Requires bluetooth or Wi-Fi.\n\n• Word Prediction\nClaroCom has built in Word Prediction when typing into the Message Window. ClaroCom's Word Prediction takes account of word frequency and previous words. There is an initial Word Prediction list loaded on startup, and ClaroCom can learn new words as they are typed if desired. \n\n• Phrase Prediction\nUse Phrase Prediction when typing into the Message Window. The phrases are loaded from the contents of the visible categories and ClaroCom stores new phrases that are typed or added. The predicted phrases appear on a Phrase bar above the keyboard. Phrases can be easily searched for, and bulk phrases can be easily added.\nPrediction works with acronyms, so as 'awn' is typed, 'Are We Nearly There Yet?' appears instantly. This is a very fast way to build up and learn a collection of phrases.\nSpeak a predicted word or phrase immediately with a ‘touch and hold’ instead of composing into a message – another faster way to get speech out. \n\nA swipe brings up more phrases and words that can be easily scanned through. \n\nFlexible phrases include fillable prompts so ClaroCom will know, when the 'I would like ___' phrase is selected, that immediately the user will be asked for the word(s) to complete the phrase. \n\nWith ClaroCom Pro phrases and words can be easily imported from files to quickly build complex phrase vocabularies from existing text resources, including files transferred via iTunes.\n\n• Dictionary\nChoose from a range of Word Prediction dictionaries.\n\n• High-Quality Voices\nAlong with the iOS system voices, 2 high-quality Nuance Vocalizer voices are included:\n◆ Daniel - English (UK)\n◆ Serena - English (UK)\n\nThe voice can be made to speak faster or slower you suit your needs. The voice is installed within ClaroCom, so will work when not online and does not use up any expensive data allowance.\n\nAdditional Nuance Expressive and Acapela voices in other accents are available through in-app purchase in ClaroCom.\n\n• Font and Colour\nChange the font size, colour or use a more-readable font to maximise ease-of-reading, making ClaroCom easily adaptable to different users' needs.\n\n• Personalise information\nClaroCom can be personalised to suit your individual needs, basic personal information is easily added and will appear in Phrases. ClaroCom Pro can be personalised by setting your name, so many phrases will detect and use it, saving time. \n\nFor the latest news, tips and advice follow @ClaroComApp on Twitter."

      "label": "****Thank you for making us a TOP 25 App in US, UK and Canada App Store category specific rankings!****\n\nSeasonal affective disorder, or SAD, is a kind of depression that appears at certain times of the year. Light therapy is one of the potential treatments for this condition. Almost 80% of the people who try light therapy find it beneficial. This app converts your apple device into a light box.\n\nWhy you SHOULD NOT download this App:\n1. If you are looking for a SAD Light Box App that generates an intensity of 10,000 Lux\n2. If you are looking for a quick fix and can not commit to consistent morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks\n3. If you will get turned off by the simplicity of this app and the solution to Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nWhy you SHOULD download this App:\n1. If you want to try a cheap yet effective alternative to a traditional Light box which uses lower intensity BLUE LIGHT (approx. 100 to 575 Lux) and is backed by research (Google research paper: The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in sub-syndromal seasonal affective disorder by NCBI, US National Library of Medicine)\n2. If you would rather be intelligent and try something for a fiver rather than spend a few hundred dollars on a conventional light box\n3. If you are able to consistently commit to regular morning exposure sessions for at least 2 weeks \n4. If you would be happy with a REALLY SIMPLE APP that transforms your Apple device into a Light box and is more portable and user friendly\n5. If the weather is making you sad :( and you would rather be happy :)\n     \nThis app can also help you:\n1. Determine if you are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/ Cabin Fever/ Winter Blues/ Seasonal Depression with help of a short scored test\n2. Create your own unique shade of Blue / White / any other color light that works best for you\n3. Use the app as a Dawn Simulator (set alarm)\n4. Set timer for your light box to time your morning exposure sessions\n5. Shop for other products to help with SAD\n6. Listen to the Radio in the background\n\nUV Rating: The UV emission from your Apple Device is 0, hence this app does not have a UV rating. \n\nSome other activities you might want to try to deal with symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder are:\n• End your morning shower with a cold shower\n• Try to arrange the spaces you spend time in to maximize sunlight exposure\n• Keep curtains open during the day\n• Trim tree branches or hedges that may be blocking some of the light from getting into your home\n• Move furniture so that you sit near a window or, if you exercise indoors, set up your exercise equipment by a window\n• Install skylights and add lamps\n• Build physical activity into your lifestyle preferably before SAD symptoms take hold. Physical activity relieves stress, builds energy and increases both your physical and mental well-being and resilience\n• Make a habit of taking a daily noon-hour walk, particularly if you commute to school or work in the dark hours of the day\n• Meditate at least 20 min a day (focus on your breathing)\n• Try High intensity training if you are fit enough and have less time\n• Maintain good sleep hygiene\n• When all else fails, try a winter vacation in sunny climates—if the pocket and work schedule allow. Keep in mind that the symptoms will recur after you return home\n\nREFUND POLICY: If you consistently use the App for 14 days and show us that you genuinely tried but did not get any results, WE WILL REFUND 100% OF YOUR MONEY. *Subject to terms and conditions of Apple Inc. and the Apple App Store.\n\nSmile, because somewhere far away, we are cheering for you :)\n\n*THIS APP MUST NOT BE USED TO SUBSTITUTE ANY MEDICATION/ MEDICAL DEVICE. THE CREATORS/ PUBLISHERS OF THIS APP WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE RESULTING AS A USE OF THIS APP. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES.

Peflog understands bronchodilatation and it creates comprehensive reports.\n\nI'm a father of four and found traditional PEF monitoring boring, time consuming and error prone. I tried to use pen and paper with my children but it didn't really work out. I creating snappy Peflog app for myself and for my children in order to make asthma tracking as easy and fast as possible for everybody.\n\nFeatures\n\n- Save Peak Flow readings with ease\n- Edit readings and monitoring periods\n- A timer reminds about the next puff after having medication\n- Comprehensive report and charts\n- Daily variation\n- Bronchodilatation (impact of the medication)\n- Reference PEF (calculated based on age, height and gender)\n- Personal best (calculated or manual)\n- Colour zones (green, yellow, red)\n- Alarming variations indicated in red\n- The PDF report is easy to send out\n- Dark and light themes and color options\n- Languages: English, Finnish, Norwegian, German, Spanish\n- Available for other platforms too\n\nIMPORTANT! This applications is not a medical device nor its substitute. You must use your own certified peak flow meter and consult a healthcare professional about its correct usage. This application provides information as is and should not be treated as a medical advice. You should always consult your healthcare professional in your health related issues and appropriate usage of the information.\n\nThank you for these kind words and five stars!\n\n*****Mar 8, 2019\nFor me is the best app for tracking my daughter's asthma. It's tell me when her asthma is going worst before she notice it. Very easy to use and you can send the peak flow chart directly to the doctor.\n\n*****Mar 4, 2019\nI'm completely satisfied with the app, I can store everything exactly as my doctor asks me. Top App.\n\n*****Feb 1, 2019 A Must Have Peak Flow App\nLove this app does what it says on the tin. Easy to use, so glad of this app, worth every penny. Nice one developer\n\n*****Dec 12, 2018 Simple to use\nTried a few apps before settling on this. Easy to use with nice, clear, graphs. Does all I need.\n\n*****Aug 11, 2018 Brilliant app and so easy to use\nI’ve tried a few asthma PEF diary apps and this is by far the best. Nice graphics, easy to use and easy to understand.\n\n*****May 5, 2018 Excellent for those under assessment\nI wanted an easy to use app that just plotted readings before and after meds and this fits the bill perfectly. It’s very easy to use and has room for notes if you want to add them. It’s much better than the basic sheet I was given by the nurse and shows up plainly how effective the meds are. Well worth paying for, thank you!"

It doesn’t set out to replace a standard text book. It certainly isn’t a substitute for a sound knowledge of anatomy and local anaesthetic pharmacology. It’s more of a guide to the occasional blocker, a refresher to the more experienced, and a teaching aid to the trainer. \n\nWe are a busy hospital with a heavy teaching commitment. Therefore we choose to use nerve stimulation in conjunction with ultrasound as we feel it adds another layer of safety to the patient, and reassurance to the operator."

      "label": "The fourth and final app in the Advanced Language Therapy series! \n\nAdvanced Writing Therapy is designed to pick up where Writing Therapy left off by delving deeper into phoneme-grapheme correspondence to strengthen writing skills. Next,​ you apply those skills to write common words and sentences to dictation, and then you can practice generating your own content. Take your writing skills to the next level! \n\n**Try this app for free with Advanced Language Therapy Lite! **\n**Get this app as part of the Advanced Language Therapy 4-in-1 value-priced app!**\n\nFour activities with built-in therapeutic supports to encourage independent practice for people with aphasia and other writing disorders.\n\n1) Match: Strengthen sound-letter matching by selecting the letters (graphemes) that match the sounds (phonemes) you hear. Work on letter names, consonants, vowels, or blends.\n**Built-in Support: Use the Keyword picture, audio, and written word cues at the top to help you learn. \n\n\n2) Spell: Practice spelling common words. The 700 words in this activity come from a list of the most common words in the English language, plus words based on vowel patterns.\n**Built-in Support: Press the Hint button to see 4 choices. Select the correct spelling, then copy the answer.\n\n\n3) Type: Practice typing common sentences from 1-8 words in length. These 400+ sentences are ones you might use in an online chat, text message, email, or social media discussion.\n**Built-in Support: Touch the Hint button to see the sentence to copy. See your errors highlighted.\n\n\n4) Write: Generate a sentence or paragraph to a writing prompt in functional categories such as taking notes, writing personal information, and making lists. \n**Built-in Support: The Hint button gives you a word bank. Select words from the word bank to add to your entry.\n\n\nThe settings allow you to adjust the difficulty, cues available, and letter case for Match. You can select word length restrictions for the Spell activity, and you can choose to show or hide the scores on-screen for users who rely on the hints. Exercises in the Type and Write activities are organized by levels of difficulty.\n\nOther Tactus Therapy Apps to Work on Writing:\n* Writing Therapy: part of Language Therapy 4-in-1 to spell pictured words\n* Advanced Comprehension Therapy: use Build to arrange words in a sentence\n* Advanced Naming Therapy: use Create to makes sentences around a verb\n* Conversation Therapy: write your answers to all 10 question prompts\n\nLooking for something else?

Lokalisation, Anmerkung zur Lokalisation, Nadelung usw.) sowie den Punktlokalisations – und Nadelungsseiten innerhalb der Nachschlagesektion hinzugefügt werden.\n\n• Die Applikation besitzt zwei Suchfunktionen. Eine Suchfunktion sucht nach Punktnamen (Englisch oder Pinyin) oder nach Punktnummern. Die andere ermöglicht es, den Inhalt jeden Punktes einzeln zu durchsuchen. Falls erforderlich, kann genau angegeben werden, innerhalb welcher Leitbahn/Kollaterale  gesucht werden soll, welche Felder innerhalb eines Punktes (z.B. Wirkungen, Indikationen, Nadelung) ausgewählt werden sollen und ob die eigenen Notizen in die Suche einbezogen werden sollen.\n\n• Die 12 Hautregionen und Körperbereiche und die sie versorgenden Leitbahnen.\n\n• Nachschlagesektion mit cun Maßen, Hinweisen zur Lokalisation und Nadelung, Indikationen-Index und Terminologie-Glossar.\n\n• Registrierte Benutzer haben zusätzlich die Möglichkeit, persönliche Notizen innerhalb der Applikation ein-oder auszublenden, sie können bestimmen, wie viele Punkte in einen Test aufgenommen werden und ob Videos fortlaufend oder individuell abgespielt werden sollen. Benutzerdaten (Notizen, Punktgruppen und Testresultate) können außerdem auf unserem Server gesichert werden, so dass Daten nach einem Geräteverlust auf einem neuen Gerät wiederhergestellt werden können. Befindet sich die Applikation auf mehr als einem Gerät, können Daten zwischen diesen Geräten synchronisiert werden.\n\nHinweis: der Indikationen-Index ist entgegen der Annahme einiger Benutzer nicht entfernt worden. Er ist lediglich der Nachschlagesektion hinzugefügt worden."

      "label": "NEWS2 Calculator is designed to make it easier for healthcare professionals to calculate NEWS or NEWS2 scores during the assessment of acute illnesses in patients.\n\nThe NEWS and NEWS2 are scoring systems which use six physiological parameters, which are recorded in routine practice, to give an aggregate score which can be used to determine the best response for acutely ill patients. The six parameters are:\n- Respiratory rate\n- Oxygen saturation\n- Systolic blood pressure\n- Pulse rate\n- Level of consciousness\n- Temperature\n\nA score is allocated to each parameter during measurement. A larger score means the parameter varies more from normal levels.\n\nNEWS2 Calculator has options to colour code the controls based on their value (for example, when changing the value of a parameter which would give a score of 3, the control turns red). The colours are based upon the NEWS2 chart which healthcare workers are already familiar with, making NEWS2 Calculator extremely intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThere is also an option for alerts to appear which provide further guidance for healthcare workers on the best course of action to take, based upon the NEWS or NEWS2 score which was calculated.\n\n- - -\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application has been designed to assist pre-hospital, community and hospital clinicians to calculate a National Early Warning Score for patients who are unwell.

After qualifying, he completed a placement at Hangzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China.\n\nHe taught at The London College of Traditional Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (LCTA), the largest institution dedicated to teaching Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in England, for ten years. He was a Senior Lecturer and a Clinical Supervisor on the BSc Acupuncture course. Paul has been involved in training literally hundreds of today’s acupuncturists and herbalists. He now teaches at The College of Naturopathic Medicine (CNM) just off of Oxford Circus, and The City College of Acupuncture, just off of Old Street.\n\nPaul is the chief presenter on “How To Locate Acupuncture Points: The Definitive DVD”, and has been published in many magazines, such as Yoga Monthly, Lifescape, Natural Health, CAM Magazine, the Dragon’s Tale, and the Chinese Medicine Times.\n\nTessa Whittaker LicAc, MBAcC\n\nTessa originally worked with and rode horses. She was encouraged to study Chinese medicine by her Shiatsu teacher and came to LCTA to learn acupuncture. Throughout her time at the College, Tessa also learnt yoga and intuitive movement – a freedom of expression that is now part of her everyday life. She now works with the Parkinson’s Recovery Project using Yin Tuina and visualization techniques on unmedicated Parkinson patients. Her riding background has inspired her to explore the use of Chinese medicine in the equestrian field, particularly Five Element riding and training techniques.\n\nABOUT SILENCE SPEAKS LTD\n (Luis Melendez)\n\nLuis is an American citizen originally from New York City whose personal journey into mind-body exploration began in 2001 when he experienced spiritual healing for the first-time while living overseas in Northamptonshire, United Kingdom. The experience, which on the surface was very unassuming in terms of setting and administration, proved transformative resulting in the life-long pursuit of Self-knowledge including completion of two spiritually-orientated academic degrees with The University of Portsmouth (BScHons Traditional Chinese Acupuncture, 2010) and University of Northampton (MScHons Transpersonal Psychology and Consciousness Studies, 2017).\n\nhttp://www.acupunctureforme.co.uk\nhttp://www.hypnosisworks.nyc\nhttp://www.silencespeaks.co.uk"

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor.

Turn on the timer option for an extra challenge!\n  Try this unique anatomy quiz game and you'll be happy you did!\n\nA quick anatomy lesson: this app features ALL the bones and many landmarks, but in the bone section, there are only 53 bones listed.... aren't there 206 bones in the body?  Most of the bones are bilateral... one on each side, so we don't quiz the right femur and left femur, this cuts the list down almost in half. Many bones are repeat... 12 ribs on each side, 10 distal phalanges, 10 proximal phalanges... When we take out all these repetitive bones, we are left with about 53 unique bones.... so please know that this app has been designed by experienced intelligent anatomists!"

      "label": "The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator is based on ERSPC, Rotterdam, data and supported by the Prostate Cancer Research Foundation, Rotterdam (SWOP)\n \n \nThe Prostate Cancer Research Foundation, Rotterdam, Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Prostaatkanker (SWOP), is an initiative of the Department of Urology of the Erasmus MC, the University and Medical Centre of Rotterdam, in The Netherlands. Its goal is the financial support of scientific research projects in the field of prostate cancer, as well as other cancers of the urinary tract.\nPlease be aware that the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS cannot be 100% accurate at predicting the presence or absence of prostate cancer. It is designed to help calculate your risk, not give a definitive diagnosis.\nThe Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS provides a general risk calculation based on your PSA level and other information.\nWhile knowing your PSA level is helpful, the decision to have a PSA test has to be taken seriously after weighing up all factors and discussing the implications with your GP or hospital doctor.\nIt is possible that prostate cancer will not be found even if you have an elevated PSA. However, it may be present even if your PSA level is low.\nYour doctor may want to take further tests. If you have doubts or questions about your health, you should always contact your GP or hospital doctor. This is particularly important if you have questions which arise from the use of our prostate cancer risk calculator.\nIt cannot be ruled out that the way the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS is used, or the indications given by it, are interpreted in a manner that is not appropriate. The creators of the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator for iOS do not accept any responsibility in any respect.\nThe European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer has published its 11-year follow-up results (New England Journal of Medicine, March 15 2012). Once again, they demonstrate that screening does significantly reduce death from prostate cancer. The latest study confirms that a man who undergoes PSA testing will have his risk of dying from prostate cancer reduced by 29%.\nERSPC is the world’s largest randomized prostate cancer screening study. It was designed to investigate whether early detection and treatment of prostate cancer might reduce disease-specific mortality and also help to identify men at risk. From 1992, the ERSPC study randomized 162,000 men, aged 55 to 69, across Europe to either a screening arm or a control group.\n\nDesigned and developed for iOS by Nuno Azevedo of Ydeal.net Software LDA"

      "label": "The purpose of this App is to accurately record the units you are consuming.  You do this by, at least, knowing the percentage alcohol and the amount of the drink - specified in ml, cl, litres, uk pints or US fl ozs.  Unlike other Apps it does not care what the drink is (e.g. a glass of wine or a pint of beer) just the units.  It does not judge you about the amount you are drinking it is trying to help you recognise how much you are drinking and manage that however you want.\n\nRecent changes have introduced the ability to mark a day as Alcohol Free, change the number of days used to calculate the rolling averages shown and, with this update, the ability to change the percentage alcohol and drink amount using the watch App rather than having to use the phone to make these changes.\n\nEver wondered how many units there are in a drink?  This App can can be used to just calculate the number of units in a drink but it can also be used to keep track of units consumed.  Just press the 'Add Units' button.  Until you ask yourself the question how many units am I consuming day by day, week by week and through the months you will have no idea.  Many people wildly underestimate the amount they drink.  This App can tell you and it can be very enlightening.  Unlike other Apps this one makes no judgement on how much you drink it is a means for you to understand the amounts and to act as you see fit.  If you choose to cut down then that is your choice.  Maybe this App will confirm that apart from the odd day or two you are generally within guidelines.  \n\nThis App is not restricted in the amounts that can be entered unlike other similar Apps.  The values are entered using a decimal number pad so you are not restricted by the values specified on picker wheels. You can enter ANY amounts using US fl Ozs, millilitres, centilitres, litres, UK pints.\n\nDrink Driving Limits: A 3.6% abv pint of beer has 2 units in it.  In the UK to remain within the drink drive limit you can have no more than 1 pint of weak (3.6%) beer - any more and you risk being over the drink drive limit.  Note, that the last sentence used the word 'weak', not one pint of beer but one pint of weak beer.  So what difference does that make?  Well a 5% beer has 2.84 units in it.  So, you're probably pushing the upper limit, if not already over it.\n\nLegal Disclaimer:  Do not use this App as a guide to whether you can drive a car or not.  This App is just for calculating and collating the number of units consumed.\n\nNow with Apple Watch support & iCloud Support to save your precious information. Easy to add the same units from your Apple Watch.  See how many units you've consumed today glancing at your Apple Watch. Save you units consumed to iCloud.  Retrieve them on another device."

It is a handy tool to learn Biochemic Cell Salts in details and apply them in your practice.\n\nThe Biochemic Tissue Salts also known as Biochemic Cell Salts or Schuessler Tissue Salts. This Biochemic system of medicine is a simple and rational science of therapeutics gifted to us by Dr. Schussler from Germany. The Biochemic system of medicine derives its name from the Greek word 'Bios' meaning 'Life' and 'Chemistry' meaning 'a branch of natural science dealing with the composition of substances and their properties and reactions'. Hence in the most literal sense, 'Biochemistry' means 'Chemistry of Life'. \n\nIt is a unique branch of therapeutics that is based on the Law of Deficiency. Professor Moleschott, of Rome says, \"The structure and vitality of the organs depend upon the presence of the necessary quantities of inorganic constituents.\" \n\nThe principle of this valuable science is based on the concept that deficiency of inorganic salts causes disharmony in the functioning of a cell, which when supplemented in requisite proportion, restores this disharmonious functioning. Thus the Biochemic system of medicines assist the body's natural efforts towards cure by supplementing these salts that are deficient in certain tissues.\n\nThe App has in-depth explanation of below twelve tissue salts :\n\n1. Calcarea Fluor (Fluoride of Lime or Calcium) CaF2\n\n2. Calcarea Phos (Phosphate of Lime or Calcium) Ca3 (PO4) 2\n\n3. Calcarea Sulph (Sulphate of Lime or Calcium) CaSO4 12H2O\n\n4. Ferrum Phos (Phosphate of Iron) FE (PO4) 2\n\n5. Kali Mur (Chloride of Potash) KCl\n\n6. Kali Phos (Phosphate of Potash) K2HPO4\n\n7. Kali Sulph (Sulphate of Potash) K2SO4\n\n8. Magnesia Phos (Phosphate of Magnesia) MgHPO4 7H2O\n\n9. Natrum Mur (Chloride of Soda or Sodium, common salt) Nacl\n\n10. Natrum Phos (Phosphate of Soda or Sodium) Na2HPO4 12H2O\n\n11. Natrum Sulph (Sulphate of Soda or Sodium) Na2SO4\n\n12. Silicea (Silica or Silicon dioxide) SiO2\n\nIn order to ease the study of the twelve Biochemic remedies every remedy is explained further in the remedy section and is listed in a certain format as follows :\n\nIntroduction\n\nSynonyms\n\nCommon Name\n\nChemical Properties\n\nPreparation\n\nPhysiochemical data\n\nCurative action\n\nAilments from\n\nConstitution\n\nDiathesis\n\nMiasms\n\nThermal Modality\n\nGeneral Indications\n\nKey Symptoms\n\nMind\n\nModalities\n\nParticular Indications\n\nClinical conditions\n\nComparison with other remedies (Biochemic and Homeopathic)\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nTherapeutics\n\nGlossary\n\nSynopsis\n\nSelf Assessing Questions"

This will help you improve your ability to detect and interpret nystagmus.\n\nAnimations showing the common treatment manoeuvres also show the semicircular canals moving in the same plane as the head with the crystals moving around and out of the canal during each manoeuvre.\n\nBPPV Relief was created by a Physiotherapist who has successfully treated over 2000 people with BPPV. It follows the same steps used to diagnose and treat BPPV in her dizziness clinic. It draws on lessons learnt over time perfecting the skills required to treat BPPV effectively. \n\nThe tests and treatments are all commonly used and follow evidence based recommendations by the Clinical Practice Guideline for BPPV updated in 2017 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology- Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.\n\nThis App is designed for:\n\n1. Health Professionals who specialise in treating people with dizziness and vertigo.\n2. Health Professionals who see people with dizziness but who don’t have access to specialists to help with diagnosis and treatment.\n3. Health Professionals who are training others to treat BPPV. This is a great teaching tool.\n4. People who have been diagnosed with BPPV by a qualified Health Professional and have been instructed by them to do a particular treatment manoeuvre at home as part of the treatment regime while under their care.\n5. People who have been diagnosed with BPPV by a qualified Health Professional and been treated successfully and safely with repositioning manoeuvres, who wish to self manage recurrences.\n\nThis App is not a substitute for medical advice. We advise you to see a Health Professional before using this App."

A major advantage of using real teeth is that many show interesting and unusual features, which would be seen on dental patients. These can be explored and are explained through an interactive guide."

      "label": "Do you have tinnitus or “ringing in the ears”? Tinnitus HQ helps you understand and relieve your tinnitus symptoms.\n\nRecent research shows that tinnitus can be treated by listening to sounds that have been filtered to remove your specific tinnitus frequencies.*\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ, you can apply advanced filters to over 500 high-quality sounds to find relief for your symptoms.\n\nSimply apply a bandpass filter to any sound or mix to isolate frequencies in a narrow range. Move this filter up and down the frequency range until it closely matches the ringing frequency in your ears. \n\nAdd a bandstop filter at these frequencies to any sound or mix to create your tinnitus mask.\n\nThe advanced filters can be applied to both ears or just one ear, and different frequency ranges can be used for each ear.\n\nYou can set a wide range of filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 octaves, down to 1Hz resolution.\n\nAnd you can adjust the volume level in each ear with a single balance control.\n\nWith Tinnitus HQ you can create advanced natural-sounding tinnitus masks to help relieve your tinnitus symptoms. \n\nTinnitus HQ features:\n\n• Over 500 high-quality natural sound recordings\n• Precision bandpass and bandstop filters to identify and mask ringing frequencies\n• Wide frequency range: 128 Hz to 16 kHz\n• Filter widths from 0.1 to 4.0 Octaves, settable to 1Hz resolution\n• Two-ear and single-ear filtering capability\n• Independent Left-Right ear filter frequencies and widths\n• Left-Right ear volume balance control\n• Easy-to-create blended mixes of any 4 sounds\n• Runs in background while using other apps or when the screen is locked\n• Timer with slow audio fade-out\n• Beautiful high-definition images from around the globe\n• Modern easy-to-use interface\n• 15 different natural sound categories, including Rain, Rivers & Streams, Ocean, Lakes, Wind, Water Fountains, Fire, Birds, Crickets & Insects, Cars, Trains, Public Places, Household, Industrial, Soundscapes.\n\nDownload Tinnitus HQ now.\n\n\n* See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138595, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/3/1207.full, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2918775/ for descriptions of notched sound therapy and its positive results.\n\n* Please talk with your doctor about ringing in the ears and any other symptoms.

The app's efficacy is supported by independent research studies, including a 2016 study by Huntington University published in the Journal of Hand Therapy.\n\n• Increases coordination and motor control in the hands and fingers\n\n• Works for kids and adults\n\n• Automatically creates performance and usage reports that can be emailed\n\n• Speeds recovery from injuries and stroke\n\n• Designed in consultation with Occupational Therapists\n\n• Turns the iPad into a therapeutic tool\n \nFor best therapeutic results the exercises should be done on a regular basis in short sessions. The exercises are designed to be repeatable and engaging.\n\nThe automatic tracking and reporting feature makes it easy for parents, teachers and occupational therapists to identify time on task and progress.  You can email the progress reports right from the app itself.\n\nMulti-user tracking is available as an in-app purchase. (Note to Volume Purchase Program customers: Consider buying Dexteria VPP instead. It includes multi-user tracking and you will pay a lower net cost than if you buy Dexteria and upgrade each copy via the in-app purchase.

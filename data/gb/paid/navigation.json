The Isle of Man is included only at 1:250,000 (free) and 1:50,000 (paid). The Channel Islands are not included.\n\nSince 2010, Britain's national mapping agency Ordnance Survey has released a large amount of free map data.  UK Map makes much of that data available in a single app. It includes 1:1M MiniScale® and 1:250k road maps, which are built into the app, and 1:25k district maps and 1:10k street maps for the entire country which you can download in 5km by 5km tiles.  As the free O.S. data does not include footpaths, this app superimposes footpaths derived from volunteer-collected data from OpenStreetMap.org.  These downloads are free of charge.\n\nIn addition to the free maps, you can also purchase and download 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 maps that are just like the Ordnance Survey paper maps.  You can also purchase 1:10,000 maps for selected urban areas which show more detail than the free 1:10,000 maps.\n\nOnce you've downloaded the detailed maps that you need, an internet connection is not required.\n\nThe app can load GPX files (for example, from websites, other apps and from nearby devices via AirDrop) and display waypoints, tracks and routes.  You can also mark waypoints, plan routes and record tracks within the app, and export them.\n\nYou can view graphs of altitude or speed along recorded tracks and routes.\n\nThe app has a 3D mode that lets you view the terrain from any viewpoint, useful for visualising hills and mountains.\n\nThe app also includes a searchable gazetteer containing over 250,000 place names, 850,000 street names and 1.6 million post codes. All of this data is built in to the app, so this search also works when there is no network connection.\n\nThe app also supports the compass and GPS - on those devices that have them - to display your position, orientation and altitude.\n\nPaid maps are licensed for personal and non-commercial use only.\n\nContains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database rights 2011 - 2021.

      "label": "What is WikiFarms Australia?\n\nWikiFarms Australia is the essential application for backpackers looking for a farm job in Australia. Whether you are looking for a casual job during your trip or aiming to complete your 88 days of farm work to get your Second Year Visa, WikiFarms Australia will be your guide!\nThe application will help you to be in direct contact with farmers by making available a map with thousands of farms around Australia!\nThe database is always growing and constantly being updated by our team: companies are added weekly, contacts are regularly verified, making it the largest database for fruit picking jobs in Australia! With more than 2000 companies listed in the app you’ll have all the information you need to find a farm job quickly.\n\n \nSo do not wait to get the best farm job tool available in Australia!\n\n \nWhat can I do with the app?\n\nWikiFarms Australia makes it easy to find a farm. Simply use the map screen to see exactly where are located the farms. Then tap a site to bring up its description. It will show you the name of the company, type of crops, phone number, and, for some of them, website and email. You can then call the farmers directly from the app and ask them if they need workers. If you are ready to go, you can also start an itinerary from your current location and ask them in person!\n\nThe app also allows you to use filters. If you are looking to work in a specific area or to pick a specific type of fruit during a specific time, you can do that!\n\nThe app lists also tons of working hostels, tourism offices, working agencies that can give you more information or help to find a job in a specific area.\n\nWith the app you can also calculate your 88 days of farm work easily and see if you’re ready to apply for the Second (or Third soon!) Year Visa.\n\n \nWho made WikiFarms Australia?\n\nFellow backpackers like you created WikiFarms Australia! When we were looking for farm work to get our Second Year Visa, we really struggled knowing where to look for farms! There was some information here and there but nothing really consistent. This is when we started to think about a tool that will have all the farmers at once and WikiFarms Australia started just like that J\n\n \nWhy is the app not free?\n\nWe are a very small team working on this project for more than 2 years! As a result, the profit of the app really helps us to make it better day after day. In addition, it also contributes to our travelling passion (which we are sure that if you are here you can relate!)\n\nIn addition, you certainly think that most apps are free, but are they really? Most of the time, free apps are full of unwanted and annoying ads and you often have to pay more to have the full use of it.\n\nWe made the choice to offer a complete, advertising-free experience for as low of a price as we could make it. Consider that half the price you pay for it goes to taxes and Google share.\n\nThe application helps you get what you need the most, find a farm job, and when you will get it, its price will be covered in less than half an hour of work!\n\nThanks for your purchase and we hope that you’ll have a good experience with our app!\n\n \nFeel free to join us on our Facebook page or to visit our website:\nhttps://wikifarmsaustralia.com/\n\n \nAre you a farmer looking for workers? You can contact us at: info.wikifarms@gmail.com\nWe will answer you within 24h."

      "label": "This app provides complete offline topographic map coverage of the South Island of New Zealand from the LINZ Topo50 1:50k scale map series.  The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50,000 scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

Mae’n gartref i gymuned fywiog, egnïol, ac i fusnesau a mannau gwaith arloesol yn ogystal â chlytwaith o ffermydd mynydd. Mae'n ased cenedlaethol a hwn yw mynydd mwyaf poblogaidd y Deyrnas Unedig o ran ymwelwyr. Mae'n denu pobl o bob cwr o Gymru, y DU, ac o bob rhan o'r byd.\n\nDyluniwyd yr ap gan Awdurdod Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri a phartneriaid gweithgar sy’n cynnwys cynrychiolwyr o sefydliadau sydd â dyletswydd ymarferol o reoli’r mynydd ar lawr gwlad. Mae’r gwaith yn amrywio o reolaeth cadwraeth a llwybrau i dwristiaeth, ffermio ac achub mynydd.\n\nMae’r ap yn hawdd i’w ddefnyddio, yn gweithio gyda GPS ac yn cynnwys mapiau manwl sy’n dilyn eich taith wrth i chi gerdded ar unrhyw un o’r 6 prif lwybr i’r copa. Mae hyn yn gweithio all-lein, sy’n golygu nad oes angen cyflenwad i’r we neu signal ffôn tra’n ei ddefnyddio ar y mynydd. Mae pob map yn cynnwys cyfuchliniau fel y gallwch gadw golwg ar ddarnau anodd wrth i chi gerdded.\n\nFe fydd yr ap yn eich helpu i gynllunio ymlaen llaw cyn eich ymweliad ac yn cynnwys cyngor pwysig fydd yn eich galluogi i’n cynorthwyo i barchu, gofalu, a gwarchod y mynydd, yr amgylchedd o’i amgylch, a’r cymunedau lleol.\n\nYn cynnwys data AO © Hawlfraint y goron a hawl basdata 2020.\n\nDatblygwyd yr ap gan Tiny Mobile Limited ar gyfer Partneriaeth Yr Wyddfa. Cysylltwch â paul@tinymobile.co.uk os oes diddordeb gennych mewn datblygu ap cerdded.\n\n\n\n\nYr Wyddfa (pronounced uhr-with-va) is a globally renowned, iconic mountain and home to vibrant, energetic communities and a mosaic of upland hill farms. It is a national asset, the most visited mountain in the UK, attracting people from across Wales, the UK and around the world.\n\nThis app is designed by the Snowdonia National Park Authority together with partners who are responsible for the on-the-ground management of the mountain. The work ranges from conservation and path management to tourism, farming and mountain rescue.\n\nOur simple to use GPS-enabled app covers the 6 main paths to the summit of Yr Wyddfa with detailed route maps that tracks your progress as you ascend. This works offline, meaning no internet or phone signal is required when using the app on the mountain. Each map also includes contour information so you can look out for hazardous sections as you climb.\n\nThis app will also help you plan ahead before your visit and includes important advice which will allow you to help us respect, care, and protect this incredible mountain, the surrounding environment and local communities.\n\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\n\nThis walking app was developed for Partneriaeth Yr Wyddfa by Tinymobile Limited. Email Paul on paul@tinymobile.co.uk if you would like to discuss walking app development."

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

Highly recommend it.\" \n\nThe Mayan People have described, in breathtaking precision, the cycles of both the universe and nature around us. They created a harmonic calendar that is synchronized to all those cycles. Following these cycles can help you get a stronger connection with nature around you and become conscious of your essence.\n\nThis app provides a simple way to sync along those cycles, to raise our frequency and give us a new lens to view both our day-to-day and planetary events.\n\n- Did you ever realize that our (Gregorian) calendar is not a harmonic calendar? \n- Did you know that the moon has 13 (not 12!) orbits around the earth in 1 year? \n- Why do we live with this irregular calendar?\n- Are you interested in Astrology?\n\n-> All this, and more, is explained carefully in this app. (over 15.000 words on 37 pages) Please note that these text are in English language only.\n\nIn the New Time, synchronicity is the norm.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n5 star rating across the world! \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\"Entertaining as well as enlightening\" \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// \n\nMORE INFO: \nwww.1320sync.com \n\n\nFor the beginner this app is a learning tool because it contains an extensive explanation about Tones and Seals and the synchronizing order of the Mayan Astrology.

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

      "label": "Featured by Apple in “Best New Apps”!\n\nPlan your next trip. Mark places you want to go. Remember your favorite spots. Across town or across the world, you’ll never forget another place with Pinbox!\n\nAdd pins where you are, where you’ve been, or where you want to go. Pinbox makes it easy to quickly record and organize your important places into distinct maps for every activity, occasion, or geographic region.\n\nUnlike other apps, Pinbox doesn’t force you to save all your places on a single map. You can make one map for your favorite local restaurants - make another map for your next business trip or vacation - and make another map for errands you need to run this weekend. The possibilities are endless!\n\nPinbox is about you and your places. It’s not a social network. You don’t have to create an account or enter your Facebook details to use the app. Your maps aren’t cluttered with random places bookmarked by strangers. Pinbox is simply the best app for privately bookmarking places that are important to YOU!\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Simple, easy-to-use interface\n• Drop a pin for each place you want to remember\n• Add photos, notes, and other details to each pin\n• Choose from seven different pin colors\n• Organize your pins into separate maps\n• See your location in relation to your pins\n• Send maps to other Pinbox users\n• Send pins to Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze, or Transit for directions\n• Save up to 2,500 pins\n• Display maps in Standard, Hybrid, or Satellite\n\nEXAMPLES OF MAPS YOU MIGHT CREATE\n\n• Travel planning\n• Favorite restaurants or restaurants to try\n• Customer locations / sales calls\n• Friends and family locations\n• Real Estate listings\n• Favorite hiking / biking trails\n• Secret fishing spots\n• Dog-friendly places\n• Parking spots\n• Favorite stores\n• Multi-stop errands\n• Potential photoshoot locations\n• The list goes on and on and on…\n\n\nStill not convinced? Here’s a few of our favorite reviews…\n\n\n“Pinbox is one of those simple apps that does one thing so well it feels frictionless”.\n-- Stephen Grassie\n\n\n“The interface is gorgeous - I would say that it looks like something Apple designed”.\n-- Macaddict\n\n\n“I have been using this to keep track of all the places the kids and I go so they can see how spread out our world is and they can see where all we have gone. Will use it forever”.\n-- 1Cool Daddy\n\n\n“This app is extremely useful and so simple to use. A lifesaver for keeping track of locations”.\n-- Davies Photo\n\n\n“I love this app. It is exactly what it claims to be. I have wanted this app since the smartphone was invented. So simple, and so many uses”.\n-- T1Man\n\n\n\nUsing Pinbox on an iPod Touch or an iPad:\nLike other map apps, Pinbox uses GPS to determine your location. iPods and Wi-Fi-only iPads do not have a GPS receiver. On these devices, Pinbox provides your approximate location using information based on your proximity to known Wi-Fi networks (when on and available). The more accurate the available information, the smaller the circle identifying your position on the map. This feature is not available in all areas. Known Wi-Fi networks are predominantly in urban areas. An internet connection is required to load maps, look up addresses, and search. Although Pinbox can be installed on iPads, it’s not formatted for the larger iPad screen - it runs doubled like all other iPhone apps.\n\n\n\nPinbox is the result of a collaboration between Scott D. Smith and Paul Burd. We sincerely hope you like it!"

      "label": "BACKGROUND:\n\nBuilt from the ground up in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, Tactical NAV comes from the mind of a U.S. Army Field Artillery officer who had a vision of creating a low-cost and highly accurate tactical navigation platform built specifically for military service members.\n\nTactical NAV's journey began in the notorious Pech River Valley of Kunar Province, Afghanistan. \n\nU.S. Army Capt. Jonathan J. Springer, a Fire Support Officer with the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), began developing the tactical navigation platform following the memorial services for Spc. Blair D. Thompson and Spc. Jared C. Plunk, who were killed in action on June 25, 2010.\n\nAfter pitching the idea and being turned away by the Department of Defense on multiple occasions, Captain Jonathan J. Springer remained resolute in his mission to continue developing Tactical NAV — even to this day. His ultimate goals were (and still are) to make a difference for other Soldiers and honor the men and women killed and wounded in battle.\n\nHe used his life savings to continue moving forward with the Tactical NAV project, all with the ultimate hope of saving military lives and helping his fellow service members accomplish their mission at home and abroad.\n\nTactical NAV officially launched on the App Store on February 14, 2011.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTactical NAV's mission is to provide military service members with a low-cost, highly accurate, and exceedingly powerful mobile tactical navigational solution.\n\nVISION:\n\nOur vision is to assist and support our nation's service members with their mobile navigational needs and further enable them to operate and win during Multi-Domain Operations (MDO).\n\nBUILT FOR ACCURACY:\n\nTactical NAV's performance is on par with the AN/PSN-13 Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and it has the feedback to prove it.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nCreated on the battlefield, Tactical NAV was the very first MGRS-focused navigation app available on the App Store. It is also the only combat-proven app available today. It has proven to be effective across a multitude of environments all throughout the world.\n\nTactical NAV has been successfully evaluated against other software platforms and devices such as Nett Warrior, JCR, BFT, JBC-P, and ATAK. Its accuracy is within 1-to-3 meters of these officially approved systems issued by the Department of Defense.\n\nIAPs & SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n\nTactical NAV contains in-app purchases (IAPs) and subscriptions. Currently, tactical drawing mode is available as an in-app purchase, and offline mapping is also available to users as either a monthly or yearly subscription. All revenue generated from these features goes towards further developmental coding and updates, and a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities that specifically benefit disabled veterans. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n• A military-quality precision targeting platform\n• Purpose-built for the individual Soldier\n• Offline mapping capabilities (complete usage of the TACNAV platform with no emission of a cellular signal)\n• WGS 84 standard (MGRS, UTM, BNG, and USNG coordinates)\n• Tactical drawing mode (e.g., useful for Joint Fires planning, creating overlays, route planning, and so forth)\n• Waypoint plotting functionality with military graphics (per FM 1-02.2)\n• Compass \"FastLock\" function for capturing quick azimuths\n• Snap and save photographs onto the main map for intelligence purposes and AARs\n• Location, waypoint, and photo-sharing capabilities (via email and text)\n• One-button night mode function for low-light situations \n• \"Go to Grid\" option for intelligent pinpoint planning and drawing of overlays\n• Created and tested to ensure utmost accuracy and reliability \n• iOS native code built for austere and contested environments\n• And so much more!!!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n \nThe Department of Defense does not endorse Tactical NAV, nor should it be used in life-threatening or combat situations in place of a government-issued device."

      "label": "Never be without the tides again!\n\nYou too can carry the tides in your pocket (or now, on your wrist!) as you walk along the shore, fly into a harbor, or sail off into the sunset. AyeTides displays tides and/or currents for over 12,500 locations worldwide and unlike many other tide apps, it does not require a network connection. With AyeTides you will never see those annoying ads or be asked to pay for additional features! Sailors, harbor pilots, beachcombers, nature photographers, and more use AyeTides to plan their outings on or around the world's oceans. \n\nHere are some of the things people are saying about AyeTides... \n\n\"AyeTides is a quality professional product”\n\n\"Your support has been the best I have experienced!\"\n\n“As a harbor pilot in New York I’ve been using your excellent tide and current app”\n\n\"I really appreciate the effort that you put into making AyeTides as accurate as it can be. It is a great program that has been very useful to us. I think we have 60 pilots using iPhones and iNavX and your app links in so well.\"\n\n\"I am a ships Pilot in BC and use Aye Tides a lot and it has become invaluable.”\n\nYou can see the day’s events in tabular form, or you can rotate the phone for an interactive graph that shows you the tide’s value at any point during the day. You can find a station on a map, by name, or based on your current location.\n\nAyeTides is updated regularly and stations are added whenever we find new data. We encourage our customers to contact us if you hare having any issues with the program so that we can help you. \n\nThis app is designed to run on your iPhone or iPod Touch. While it will run on your iPad, it does not offer the additional features available with AyeTides XL, which was designed specifically for the iPad. If you have multiple devices, you may want to consider our bundle. You get both apps at a discount!\n\nThis is the only place to install AyeTides. Other websites may look like they have AyeTides, but they do not. We only support iOS, any other version of AyeTides is not ours."

Just find the locations close by and start navigating. And, you can also store locations on your device for offline use. A connection is needed to use the map, but stored locations are always available. Store the locations before leaving, so when you find yourself in a country where you have no connection, you can still find the aircraft you are looking for."

      "label": "Are you a pilot, sailor or an outdoor adventurer ? Then the Digital Bearing Compass augmented reality app will be a valuable tool for you. Aim at objects in sight and directly read the true and magnetic bearing. Then you can check your bearings on the map. In addition, the current position, including the altitude above sea level is displayed.\n\nOr you can set a fix in the map view. Bearing and distance to the fix is constantly computed. In the camera view, the difference angle between current bearing and the fix is also displayed. There is also a red marker at the location of the fix in camera view displayed by augmented reality technology.\n\nSince version 3.x you can also set a mark on the current location. This mark is also displayed in the camera view. The app shows the distance and bearing to this marked location.\n\nBy taking 2 bearings or by using the fix, you can measure the angle between 2 points or objects ... if you are a sailor or yachtsman, you know what you can do with this information. You can use them directly for navigation, since this corresponds to the functionality of a sextant. You can also use trigonometry to determine the size of a distant object. By getting 2 bearings you can also apply the method of cross bearing directly. The bearings are automatically saved, so they will be available when you start the app the next time.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- The App uses the high-tech sensors of your iPhone or iPad to measure orientation, device and declination (the angle between the direction to Geographic North and Magnetic North, pilots call it variation).\n\n- Augmented reality technology, available since iOS 11. The app will also be continuously improved, further developed and equipped with new features.\n\n- You can switch between camera mode and map mode.\n\n- The angle between 2 points or objects can be measured.\n\n- A fix can be set in map view which is shown also in camera view.\n\n- You can set a mark on the actual position. This mark is also displayed in the camera view.\n\n- The position and direction of the bearings and the fix are drawn in the map.\n\n- This way a cross bearing is possible.\n\n- day/night mode\n\n- you can choose between different coordinate formats\n\n- you can choose between different distance and altitude units\n\n- the cardinal directions are shown in the camera view\n\n\nNo matter if you are a pilot, seal, scientist, astronomer, technician, geographer or outdoor athlete, you will find the app extremely valuable for your orientation and navigation. And it is fun.\n\nPlease note that some sensors require a time to calibrate. Sometimes it might be the case that after starting the app, for a few seconds a wrong direction will be displayed. The camera should be moved slowly back and forth in this case so that the device can perform the calibration.\n\nThe app needs the permission to use the GPS. No data will be sent from the app to the outside world.\n\nThe app also uses augmented reality, a brand new technology which is supported only by the newest devices. You need at least an iPhone 6s or later, an iPad pro 2nd generation or later, or an iPad 2017 or later. Future devices will all support augmented reality."

For all mariners, from kayakers to ship captains.\n\nProduct Description:\n\nBased on the International and US Inland Navigation Rules along with the published edition of the USCG database of license exam questions, this App helps you master the Navigation Rules using a practice exam driven methodology.\n\nUsing NavRules you generate practice exams where you:\n• control the number of questions,\n• control the scope of the questions (international vs inland),\n• specify a filter (a text string that must appear in the question),\n• specify the rule the questions pertain to,\n• identify whether the question has been previously answered or not, or answered incorrectly or not.\nThis gives you control over the tests that are generated so you can focus your learning experience.\n\nAfter taking an exam you can review the results to see:\n• which questions were answered correctly,\n• for incorrect answers the correct answer,\n• the rule the question pertains to so you can understand the context of the question.\n\nEvery practice exam you take tracks your results relative the the Navigation Rules Question Pool.  By browsing the Question Pool you can see your progress on understanding each rule.\n\nFor each rule NavRules reposts:\n• your coverage (number of questions you have answered) and,\n• your proficiency (the percentage of questions you have answered correctly).\n\nIf you want to study a rule you can link directly to the questions related to that rule and choose the answers.  In this \"review\" mode you get immediate feedback on whether your answer is correct (but these results are not recorded and do not impact your rule coverage or proficiency).\n\nThe Flash Card mode lets you see all the diagrams used in the tests and from each of them see the questions that reference that diagram.\n\nThe included Rule Book provides:\n• index to US Inland, International and Canadian Rules,\n• link to all illustrations used in the Navigation Rules,\n• link to all vessel lights by vessel type,\n• definitions,\n• demarcation lines,\n• special terminology,\n• distress signals\n• references.\n\nOther features include:\n• over 1200 answered and referenced questions on the Navigation Rules,\n• complete copy of the Navigation Rules,\n• custom design your practice tests by number, filter, and type so you can focus on what you need to learn,\n• rules are clearly identified as Inland and International or both,\n• all practice tests results are stored until manually deleted,\n• Canadian Modifications to the Navigation Rules."

      "label": "Pro Altimeter for Watch is the newest Watch app from Hunter Research, developer of the popular outdoors app Theodolite.  Pro Altimeter uses the high-fidelity barometric pressure sensor in the Apple Watch to measure and compute altitude.  Although this is a Watch app, it has the same features, capabilities, and accuracy as the Pro Altimeter app for iPhone and iPad, just in a smaller form factor on your wrist!\n\nPro Altimeter has a dead simple interface.  Barometric altitude and GPS altitude are displayed in large easy to read numbers, with available units of feet or meters, and realtime accuracy estimates from the hardware.  At bottom are calibration and settings buttons. The display offers highly-readable color schemes of luminescent green on black, white on black, and midnight red on black.\n\nProper calibration is necessary to measure altitude from barometric pressure (this is why a pilot \"dials in\" the cockpit altimeter before taking off). Pro Altimeter offers numerous methods for calibration -- choose the easiest and most convenient:\n\n1. Use GPS altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with the altitude measured by GPS. This method can be used when your device has a clear line of sight to the sky and a reliable GPS fix with good accuracy that you trust.\n\n2. Manually enter altitude in feet or meters.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with known altitude from landmarks, elevation benchmarks, trail markers, topo maps, land surveys, etc.\n\n3. Manually enter pressure.  If you have a weather station, weather report, or METAR report with equivalent sea level pressure for a nearby location, this can be used to correlate local barometric pressure to altitude.  Pressure can be entered with units of inches Hg, kPa, or mb. \n\n4. Check local airports.  With the tap of a button, Pro Altimeter will locate the five closest airports within 100 miles (160km) of your present location anywhere in the world, and pull in METAR data.  From that list of five, pick the airport of your choice and Pro Altimeter will import pressure data for calibration.\n\nOnce calibrated, Pro Altimeter keeps track of the time since its last calibration.  Because weather and local barometric pressure change over time, the app will warn you when 6 hours have elapsed since the last calibration by flashing the \"CAL\" button.  You should calibrate as frequently as practical -- for example, on a hike, calibrate whenever you pass a trail marker or elevation benchmark, or hourly.  But at a minimum, calibrate at least every 6 hours or whenever weather changes in your area.\n\nPro Altimeter runs on all Apple Watch models running watchOS 8.3 or later."

Using the GPS features of this app can significantly affect battery life. Only leave GPS enabled when you need to use it. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Pocket Earth only uses GPS in the background for route navigation and gps track recording features. \n   2. This app uses data from the amazing community driven open mapping project called openstreetmap.org!  Coverage detail may vary by region, please visit our website to check the map detail for your regions of interest.\n   3. Does not currently support all asian texts on the map (Chinese, Japanese, etc)."

      "label": "This app provides complete offline topographic map coverage of the North Island of New Zealand from the LINZ Topo50 1:50k scale map series.  The maps are all contained in the installation so there is no additional need for downloads, no need for phone or wifi signal, no slow server issues, no account signups, no missing tiles, and no additional map fees. Just install for seamless off-line zooming and panning across the whole island down to 1:50k scale. The app also includes 1:50k resolution satellite images for the island, and elevation data.\n\nOther integrated data includes DOC open and restricted hunting permit boundaries, DOC huts, campgrounds, and tracks, Fish and Game access points, and Te Araroa trails. Other datasets can be imported.\n\nThe app has a full suite of navigation functions including GPS location, compass orientation, distance to map locations, track recording and graphing, route creation and following, import/export of gpx and kml files, search functions for named places and user data. Add and edit your own locations and routes and plot elevation profiles. Uses an intuitive simple interface, with one-touch access to all functions.\n\nLINZ TOPO250 series maps are used at lower zoom levels for easier navigation.\n\nPerfect for outback use out of cell phone range. GPS and maps function fully without phone coverage. No need to cache files in advance either as they are all fully installed with the app. Popular with trampers, hikers, runners, bikers, search and rescue (SAR), hunters, boaters, as well as survey applications.\n\nNote that continuous use of GPS will run down the battery faster than when not using the GPS. The NZTopo50 app gives you full control over when GPS is used. The map can be used without GPS, intermittently with GPS for spot checking of location, continuously for logging while the app is open, or for continuous background logging when the phone is off. \n\nCheck our website for links to user guides and useful tips and tricks.\n\nFeel free to get in touch with any suggestions."

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

      "label": "Professional Augmented Reality Bearing Compass with real-time camera and map views, bearing markers and up to 8x zoom providing Compass Binocular features at a fraction of the cost.\n\n\"..works nicely, we tried it out at the Voiles d'Antibes...the Captain's response when trying it out was 'Cool!'.\" - Boatbookings, The World's Leading Online Yacht Charter Broker\n\nCompass Eye can be used to help with navigation on land, sea  or air as a bearing or marching compass.\n\nCompass Eye is fully gimballed and works accurately in all orientations and angles when held vertical and horizontal.\n\n“This app is a compass on steroids! It is fully gimballed so it will work in any orientation on your iPhone or iPad.  You can use it on land while hiking or as a hand bearing compass on the ocean or in the air while flying.” i-Marine Apps\n\n\"The app's compass works way better than the iOS default compass and I don't have to wave my iPhone in the air every time I launch the app.\" Gizmodo Review (App of The Day, 6th December).\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n- Real time, accurate in all orientations\n- Compass overlaid on live camera view\n- 8x Digital zoom\n- Back, transit, or collision bearing markers\n- Draggable Green and red bearing lines\n- Triangulation bearings\n- Optional time, date and GPS location information\n- Magnetic or True North setting with variation based on location\n- Live map view with position and track\n- Artificial Horizon with roll and pitch readout\n- Night Vision and FLIROne® Infra-red support\n- Location sharing\n- Longitude and latitude degree display in DD° MM.mmm', DD° MM' SS.ss\" and now DD.ddd°\n- iOS Dark mode support\n- Full screen on iPhoneX and later devices\n\nEnabling GPS also shows the Speed Over Ground (SOG) , Course Over Ground (COG) and optional COG bearing (purple).\n\nHOW TO USE\n\nTaking a bearing - look through your iPhone at the distant object, line it up with the centre line and read off the bearing! Zoom in to get more accuracy.\n\nSetting a bearing - look through your iPhone at the point you want to get to, tap the Bearing button (Top right) and follow the yellow  bearing line.\n\nSetting a bearing from the map - lay the iPhone flat, rotate or drag a bearing line  to line up with the point you are aiming for  and follow that bearing.\n\nTriangulation - use  the three bearing lines - yellow green and red to take bearings on 3 points. Capture the view including compass, bearings, time and location information (Camera button on left of screen)  and then use the photo to plot a fix on a chart.\n\nClearance bearings to a point on an approach - set one line to the minimum bearing (e.g. the angle the target must bear greater than) and the other line to the maximum bearing and navigate between the two. Use the colours according to the IALA lateral markings to help you remember which way to steer. e.g. in North America use red for the minimum bearing and green for the maximum (vice-versa in Europe!).\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nBased on the iPhone camera the image specification at full zoom compares favourably with a 7x50 pair of binoculars:\n- Field of Vision at 1000m at 8x: 122m\n- Angle of view at 8x: approx 7 degrees\n- ISO 3200 or better.\n\nNAVIGATION SAFETY\nCompass Eye should only be used for basic navigation assistance. Never rely solely on the digital compass for determining direction, proximity or distance. The user is responsible for the prudent use of information provided by this application and must not use it for direct navigation. \n \nRequirements: iOS device with back facing Camera, Magnetometer and accelerometer (gps is optional).\n\nN.B. Battery consumption can go up considerably when the iPhone's GPS is enabled, Compass Eye allows you to turn off location display to preserve battery life.\n\nTerms of Use: http://seanav.net/termsofuse.php\n\nPrivacy Policy: http://seanav.net/privacy.php\n\nSupport: help@pocketmariner.com"

The entire circular image can be rotated to match the aircraft's heading to allow the pilot to visualize the aircraft's approach to the holding pattern. The aircraft's heading can either be set manually or automatically based on the magnetic heading of the iDevice being used.\n\nThis app is designed for optimal viewing and use on an iPad or iPhone 5 screen size or larger.

Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

At some points you will be able to take a photograph with Percy.\n\nPercy Lion can sometimes be found hiding in shop windows. If you spot Percy and have downloaded the App and can show the Shop Assistant/Owner, you will be able to ask for a percentage discount as agreed with the shop.\n\nPlease stay safe while discovering the lions on the trail and help us to ensure that everyone can enjoy it by maintaining a safe distance wherever possible, wearing a face covering if it gets crowded and being respectful to other trail visitors.\n\nWe recommend using the Red route and numbered Pictures to get the best from the App Trail but you can dip into it however you wish and come back to it at other times.\n\nYou can click on each Find/Point of Interest picture and read the Percy Trail story as you follow the route. There is also historical information available on the Useful Notes Tab.\n\nTo activate the animation at each location you will need to click on the tab which states 'I’ve seen this', then click on ‘See the Lion here now’ – this will give you the opportunity to resize the lion and move it around as well as take a fun picture.\n\nOnce you have completed the Trail, we welcome your feedback, thank you."

Our interactive map guides you to where you want to go. Don’t use those paper maps, they are not eco-friendly and they are difficult to read - \nOur mapping works even if you don't have a signal (web-based maps can't do that). \n \nZooMap is not affiliated with the Cincinnati Zoo, but we love zoos and what they do for the community. When our CEO saw people enter the zoo and rush to a poorly executed wall map or try to navigate using outdated paper maps that are wasteful and not very eco-friendly.  He knew we could help. Our goal is to increase your fun, while saving your time (and trees).\n \nTap on screen icons, use the search bar or open main menu to find animals, food, rides and attractions – even bathrooms and water fountains on those hot days. Soon, you will be able to receive notifications concerning feeding times, ride closures or any other up to the minute information you need to have the best time possible in the zoo. \n\nZooMap Features\n\nSAVE PARKING SPACE\n-\tUpon arrival you can save your parking location and BetterMaps will bring you right back to where you parked at the end of the day.\n\nGET TO KNOW THE ANIMALS\n-\tUse our menus to see pics, learn about the animals; then get mapped right to them.\n\nGET DIRECTIONS VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE ZOO\n-\tFind Animals, Exhibits, Rides, Restaurant and shopping, then click the MapMe walker icon. You will see how far and approximate time to walk there. Click Go and our live map will bring you to your destination. Veer off course and BetterMaps will adapt in real time. \n\nBE IN THE KNOW (ONLY IF ZOO PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION)\n-\tReceive notifications updating you on ride and animal closures\n-\tReceive discounts from surrounding businesses\n\nFOR BUSINESS OWNERS: MALLS, ZOOS, PARKS, MUNICIPALITIES, AMUSEMENT\nBetterMaps takes maps to a whole new level – the micro-level.

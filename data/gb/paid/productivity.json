Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date.

Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

Its advanced simulation engine can handle both analog and digital circuits and features realtime always-on analysis. It is the perfect companion to students, hobbyists, and engineers.\n\nYou use it as you would any CAD program: you add elements, connect them together, and set their properties.\n\nBut iCircuit is unlike other CAD programs because it is always simulating. It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!\n\nThere are over 70 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from a programmable Arduino, to simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETS, to digital gates.\n\nThe app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals. The scope can also display the Fourier transform of any signal so that you can see the performance of filters.\n\nSupported elements include:\n\n• Programmable Arduino using a subset of the C programming language\n• Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources\n• Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors\n• Manual SPST/SPDT and DPST/DPDT Switches, Push buttons, and Relays\n• LEDs, Diodes, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs\n• Audio simulation with Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs\n• ADCs, and DACs\n• Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR\n• JK and D Flip-flops\n• 38 7400 series digital parts \n• 78xx and LM317 voltage regulators\n• 7-segment display and driver\n• Antenna with simulated AM and FM signals\n\nYou can also create sub circuits to introduce new elements and componentize your designs.\n\nNo matter your skill set, you'll be playing with circuits in no time with iCircuit."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

The Do Less To-Do List\n\nBento helps you do less, but more meaningful tasks.\nWe all have plenty of to-dos on our list and our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nBento doesn't replace your to-do list, it complements it!\nOne of the biggest productivity issues is prioritization - so we've limited you to 3 tasks per Bento box.\n\n---\n\nSo, how does Bento work?\n\nTASK LIMITS\n\nBento limits you to 3 tasks per box - to help you do less, but more meaningful to-dos. We limit how many boxes you can open to 7 boxes in total, to help you plan only what is most important. Our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nSMALL, MEDIUM & LARGE TASKS\n\nMuch like a box for sushi, Bento allows you to create small, medium, and large tasks helping you to organize your tasks in sizeable chunks for better completion. The best productivity experts recommend reducing your workload for better per-task performance.\n\n3 ENERGY-BASED WORKFLOWS\n\nOnce you have your 3 priority tasks. We've created 3 workflows, Eat That Frog, Climb The Summit, and the Slow Burn to help you best order your day for success and energy.\n\nSINGLE-TASK FOCUS MODE\n\nTo truly focus, we need fewer distractions. Blocking out attention to focus on just your key task can make a huge difference. Inside Bento, we have a single-task focus mode combined with a countdown timer for deep focus work states.\n\nDARK & LIGHT MODE\n\nEach box can be customized with an emoji alongside stunningly animated themes. Each theme has a light mode and dark mode, for optimal productivity.\n\n6 BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THEMES\n\nRelaxing Japanese-themed backgrounds for a soothing way to handle your most meaningful tasks.\n\n---\n\nBento can be used in a variety of ways, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Create a daily Bento to plan your 3 priority tasks\n- Plan the full week by adding up to 7 Bento boxes\n- Build a week, month, and yearly goals list for planning ahead\n\nThe Bento app is the best and most effective place to implement the Bento Methodology, a new mindful way to approach task management. Bento is now optimised for iPad as part of a single universal app for all your iOS devices.\n\n---\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nReach out on Twitter @BentoMethod or email bento@keepproductive.com for any help.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nFind the full privacy policy here: https://www.bentomethod.com/privacy"

When you have finished your gags and you are leaving the room you can choose a crowd applause sound for your exit. \nEach time you press the button will choose randomly from a selection of that style. There are between 5 and 10 of each style. They will never play the same one twice in a row either making it sound more natural\n\nPerhaps you are a wannabe stand-up comedian that needs some helpful laughs or perhaps you need some moral support for your terrible dad jokes.\nWell use this app to give the illusion you are the funniest comedian alive! if not a little original.\n\nAll sounds are original and recorded from genuine live stand-up gigs."

So rather than just ticking off your chores and reminders, completing each one earns you XP to improve and develop your character in an ongoing quest to improve stats, gain riches, and level-up.\n\nTo-do list with a Role-Playing Game spin\nStreamlined and fast to use\nRange of avatars to level-up with\nDestroy your chores in animated battles\nPoints and rewards for completing your tasks\nLoot to discover and share\n\nBy getting points for your chores it's easier to actually get things done. We all have good intentions but we need a bit of encouragement here and there. Doing the laundry is an epic feat of stamina so why not get stamina points for it?!\n\nThe to-do list is fully-featured and supports repeating tasks, displays reminders for overdue events and allows time-critical events to be assigned to specific days, while more aspirational quests can be set to \"someday\" so you don't lose sight of your goals. And each task completed is destroyed by your avatar, so get your Undead Warrior to beat-up your laundry, or your Treeman to headbutt your overspilling inbox.\n\nThe app is supplied with 5 animated avatars which grow in characteristics that represent your own life. Will you be a Maiden of Juggled Priorities, or a King of Win? The lifestyle you lead will decide."

You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

      "label": "First released in June 2010, CopyIt is the original and most feature rich grid drawing app available anywhere! See why so many artists, teachers and students are using CopyIt as an essential tool in their workflows.\n\nNEW USERS - PLEASE NOTE:\nDue to the large number of features in CopyIt, the toolbars are scrollable.  Try scrolling each toolbar to access all of the available buttons.\n\nUsed by artists such as Vincent Van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci, the grid drawing method has been brought to digital life with CopyIt. CopyIt assists you in copying, enlarging or reducing your chosen reference image using the grid drawing method. You do not even need to be artistic.\n\nThe grid drawing method has been used for centuries. It breaks images down into smaller work areas allowing you to focus on the actual lines and shapes within each square, rather than trying to draw the whole picture at once. You can't help but achieve with this method.\n\nUsing CopyIt as your reference object, it saves you from having to print your photos and ruin them by drawing grids over them, but unlike a real photo, it gives you the ability to zoom into the fine details.  With a pencil, you then draw up a grid with the same number of squares using a separate medium, such as paper or canvas. Working square by square, you CopyIt!\n\nIf you want to draw an image larger or smaller than the original, the pencil-drawn grid should be drawn larger or smaller than the original grid on the device with the same amount of squares.  All that matters is that the contents of each square are drawn to scale.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Comprehensive Help\n- Portrait or Landscape orientation\n- Universal App, compatible with iPad, iPhone and iPod touch\n- Fullscreen mode (hides toolbars)\n- Built-in Music player\n- Audible feedback (can be turned off)\n- Extra options in the Settings App\n- Set your Maximum Zoom level from x1 to x20\n- CopyIt can resist entering standby while in use\n- TubeMatch™ for approximating paint and pencil colours\n- Mosaic to average surrounding colours into coloured squares\n- Tonal Strip to help identify values\n- Media types (Imperial and Metric)\n\nGrid Options:\n- 6 Grid Types\n- Preset or custom Columns, Rows and Points grid sizing options\n- To maintain the grid visibility regardless of your photo, choose from 9 grid colors, Black (default), Gray, White, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange and Magenta\n- Grid transparency is adjustable in 5% increments \n- 5 different Grid Line thicknesses\n- Grid letters and numbers (now 8 different formats)\n- A center point in each grid square \n- Guidelines: 1/4 and 1/16 to help you copy your subject\n- Solid or Dashed Guidelines\n- Guideline colour can be set independently to Grid colour\n- SmartMove: Just touch a square once to zoom to that square\n- SmartMove: takes advantage of your maximum zoom setting, never zooming in more than that amount\n- Target mode highlights the current square and dims the rest, helping you to focus your attention\n\nFilters and Effects:\n- 12 Primary Filters\n- 6 Secondary Filters\n- Onion Skin Feature: Overlay your reference image above your work to quickly assess your accuracy\n- 12 different image aspects \n- Rotate the image in 90 degree increments\n- Vertical and Horizontal Flip image\n\nImport Options:\n- Cameras are supported - both front and back\n- Load Project\n- Load From Photo Album\n\nExport Options:\n- Save Project\n- Export Photo (AirDrop, email, message, print, export to Facebook, Twitter etc)\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to use CopyIt, a user guide is available within the App and on the Support website.\n\nYou can contact the developer on Facebook or Twitter.\nwww.facebook.com/CopyItTheGridDrawingMethod or @copyitforios\n\nThank you to all our users for their feedback and feature suggestions which have helped make CopyIt what it is today."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

Use it to create to do lists, make grocery lists, take notes, write an outline of a story, prepare notes for a presentation, make a list of gift ideas, plan a vacation... or anything else you'd want to make a list for.\n\n\nBEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED\n\nAssign a fun icon to each of your lists - there are over 450 to choose from. You can also select from 30 themes to customize the app's design to your liking.\n\n\nSIMPLE AND VERSATILE\n\nPaperless is easy to use with a clean, elegant and well thought out interface. Each list can either be a checklist or a regular list without checkboxes, making a wide variety of uses possible.\n\n\nREALLY HELPS YOU GET THINGS DONE\n\nFor checklists and todo lists, many people prefer using Paperless over traditional \"getting things done\" apps - or, they use it in addition to one. There are no due dates or priority settings, so you're left to focus on the actual tasks at hand, rather than waste time changing those settings when your priorities change. Instead, if a particular task becomes important, you can simply move it to the top of the list.\n\n\nAUTOMATIC BACKUP AND SYNCING\n\nAutomatically backup your lists and sync them between iOS devices via a free Dropbox account.\n\n\nPOWERFUL FEATURES\n\n- send lists via email, others can import your list into their copy of Paperless\n- send a plain text version of a list via iMessage, or copy it into another app\n- easily duplicate lists\n- manually reorder lists and list items\n- sort list items alphabetically\n- copy and move items from one list to another\n- comprehensive search\n- passcode lock\n\n\nPRAISED BY THE PRESS\n\n\"Paperless deserves a spot on your iPhone\" - Lex Friedman, Macworld (4.5 out of 5 mice rating)\n\n\"Paperless has a permanent spot on the first page of my iPhone's home screen... it will probably earn a similar spot on yours.\" - Marianne Schultz, AppShopper\n\n\"... a good way to ensure things get done at your own pace, free of the disappointment of missing deadlines.\" - Nick Spence, Macworld UK\n\n\"I've been trying many To Do apps since iPhone 1.0 -- from the expensive Things to Toodledo and others -- and I don't use any of them regularly. Most just require too much effort. Paperless is the first one I've found that hits that sweet spot between being simple enough you'll actually use it and powerful enough to be useful.\" - Marc Zeedar, REALbasic Developer Magazine (4.8 out of 5 rating)\n\n\"This is one nice-looking list / task app... As a basic list app, the beautiful Paperless reigns supreme.\" - Bonnie Eisenman, 148apps.com (4 out of 5 rating)\n\n\nPRAISED BY USERS\n\n\"Best app ever - The most incredibly useful app I've come across. Simple, effective and bloody marvelous!!!\"\n\n\"The simplicity of the interface and the flexibility given to the user is perfection.\"\n\n\"Simply loved it - Best app I've ever downloaded, my life is so organized now! ...\"\n\n\"After having tried a good deal of apps to get myself more organized - both free and paid - it is clear that this tops them all. Other apps presented a kind of novelty; I could fool myself into thinking that I was more organized, but it was never long before I abandoned them because it was obvious that they consumed unnecessary time. Paperless, however, has truly helped. It is streamlined, it is simple, it is sumptuous\"\n\n\nPLEASE RATE AND REVIEW\n\nIf you love Paperless, please leave a review and star rating. Thank you!"

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

      "label": "Shift Worker is designed for people who need a quick and easy way to enter and view their shifts.\n\nA traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

Time is Your most prescious resource, time to Arise!\n\n“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.\"\n― Sun Tzu, The Art of War\n\nHere is how Arise gets you from the dark playground of procrastination into productivity-land in 4 simple steps:\n\n1.If you are ready to rock it gives an initial dopamine shot with a crazy animated timer\n\n2.If something blocks your doer self, Arise guides you to identify your current demon\n\n3.It coaches you to kick the blocker demon's arse\n\n4.Comes the pomodoro rocket booster to get you into motion!\n\n\nDominating procrastination is a huge deal: it gives you back the control over your own life.\n----\n\nThe first step was to specify the enemies with surgical precision. Yes, plural, because there is not one demon but many - and every one of them requires a special treatment! Mr. Adrenaline-junkie, Mr. Intimidator, Mr. Stigmatizer and 6 other bastards.\n\nThe second insight was understanding their true nature. We realized that they are so strong, we must use their own weapon against themselves to lure them into our evil-genius trap.\n\nThe last step? To eliminate the blind spot from the system which generates the problem: your own mind. Curious how? Outsourcing the solution to an un-biased medium. Now there is an app for that. (There are countless productivity apps, but no one truly effective dedicated to anti-procrastination)\n\nAre you curious how deep the rabbit hole is?\n\nWe are on a mission. We believe, procrastination is a modern epidemic which steals your free time, your money through suboptimal productivity and yes, health (!) and as such it should be cured. We declared war on procrastination and want to turn procrastination into PREcrastination. \n\nAre you ready to destroy your demons and multiply your productive time with the help of this simple but brutally effective app? Hit download and you'll never look back...\n\nFeel free to contact us if you have any feedback: vocabjunkie@gmail.com\n\nLove this new version? Please review it to help us make it better! :)"

The Do Less To-Do List\n\nBento helps you do less, but more meaningful tasks.\nWe all have plenty of to-dos on our list and our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nBento doesn't replace your to-do list, it complements it!\nOne of the biggest productivity issues is prioritization - so we've limited you to 3 tasks per Bento box.\n\n---\n\nSo, how does Bento work?\n\nTASK LIMITS\n\nBento limits you to 3 tasks per box - to help you do less, but more meaningful to-dos. We limit how many boxes you can open to 7 boxes in total, to help you plan only what is most important. Our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nSMALL, MEDIUM & LARGE TASKS\n\nMuch like a box for sushi, Bento allows you to create small, medium, and large tasks helping you to organize your tasks in sizeable chunks for better completion. The best productivity experts recommend reducing your workload for better per-task performance.\n\n3 ENERGY-BASED WORKFLOWS\n\nOnce you have your 3 priority tasks. We've created 3 workflows, Eat That Frog, Climb The Summit, and the Slow Burn to help you best order your day for success and energy.\n\nSINGLE-TASK FOCUS MODE\n\nTo truly focus, we need fewer distractions. Blocking out attention to focus on just your key task can make a huge difference. Inside Bento, we have a single-task focus mode combined with a countdown timer for deep focus work states.\n\nDARK & LIGHT MODE\n\nEach box can be customized with an emoji alongside stunningly animated themes. Each theme has a light mode and dark mode, for optimal productivity.\n\n6 BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THEMES\n\nRelaxing Japanese-themed backgrounds for a soothing way to handle your most meaningful tasks.\n\n---\n\nBento can be used in a variety of ways, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Create a daily Bento to plan your 3 priority tasks\n- Plan the full week by adding up to 7 Bento boxes\n- Build a week, month, and yearly goals list for planning ahead\n\nThe Bento app is the best and most effective place to implement the Bento Methodology, a new mindful way to approach task management. Bento is now optimised for iPad as part of a single universal app for all your iOS devices.\n\n---\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nReach out on Twitter @BentoMethod or email bento@keepproductive.com for any help.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nFind the full privacy policy here: https://www.bentomethod.com/privacy"

It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

Simply select the type of gas, enter a value, select the units, press the 'Calculate' button and the calculator will show all gas rates (cubic metres per hour, cubic feet per hour and litres per second) and heat inputs (MJ/h, kW and BTUs per hour) based on the CV.\n\nThe Tightness Testing function allows you to quickly select between the let-by and tightness tests and has an easy to use timer. No longer do you need to fiddle about with your phone's timer!\n\nCalorific values can be entered manually (and saved) for more accurate gas rate calculation results. The calorific value of natural gas in the UK varies from about 38.3 to 40.5 MJ per cubic metre; this can mean a difference in the gas rate calculation of more than 5%! With this calculator you can add the CV for your area in the settings page and avoid these inaccuracies. The default values set for butane and propane are both the same as supplied by Calor and BOC.\n\nThe metric timer can be set to either 1 or 2 minutes. For U6 and G4 meters one minute is sufficient, for E6 meters two minutes is recommended for accuracy. The timer can be set to an audible alert, vibrate, both or neither.\n\nA torch function is included with this app if your device has an LED flash."

      "label": "Eisenhower is a time management solution based on the Eisenhower matrix, supporting you in prioritizing and getting tasks done by urgency and importance. It helps you organizing both your business and personal tasks altogether, reducing stress while increasing productivity at the same time.\n\nOther apps focus on collecting many lists and tasks, Eisenhower helps you to actually complete the ones that really matter—through providing a framework to filter incoming tasks and maximize the happy feeling of completion when finishing or delegating them.\n\n—————\nJoin many others and become more productive today!\n—————\n\nWhat our users are saying about Eisenhower:\n\n▶ \"Perfect for those with busy lifestyles or who just want to get things done.\"\n\n▶ \"Get this, now, not later. This is how Eisenhower ran a country, might be good for your productivity too.\"\n\n▶ \"Helps me to be productive - quick, easy, efficient.\"\n\n▶ \"This could be the next big thing in productivity apps.\"\n\n▶ \"I absolutely love this application and I find it to actually be hugely useful - having played with it the whole day today and populated it out with tasks I want to achieve to test the theory, I indeed finished each of the \"Do First\" tasks in order, and achieved Zero-Inbox. This is the most productive day I've had in months!\"\n\n—————\nFEATURES\n—————\n\n▶ Task Counter\nOn each to-do sheet, best manage no more than 8 tasks. Still, we have made room for unlimited tasks and notes whenever you might need it—and each sheet counts how many there are to tackle right now.\n\n▶ Focus Mode\nFor urgent and important tasks, you can use a special timer, helping you to focus on only one task for 30 minutes—or whatever duration you like best.\n\n▶ Schedule & Delegate\nUsing other task-related actions, you can directly place reminders in your calendar or send e-mails including the tasks to co-workers.\n\n▶ Cloud Sync\nOnce you have created your account, Eisenhower automatically syncs with the free web client on app.eisenhower.me—and vice versa, in real-time!\n\n—————\nMORE\n—————\n\nIf you are new to the Eisenhower matrix or just want to refresh your memory, check out our quick video tutorial here: bit.ly/eisenhower-matrix\n\nGet in Touch\nGot feedback for us?

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter.

      "label": "Congratulations! You’ve just discovered the app that perfects the process of improved attention and focus. Old science has taught us new ways to unlock the power of your brain to stay focused and attentive, even on tasks where it feels nearly impossible. With this app you will experience consistent increases in: \n\n\t-Sustained attention \n\t-Increased focus\n\t-Consistent on-task behavior\n\nYou will become less distracted and more productive, even on the most boring of tasks. \n\nOld Science + New Technology = Earned Success \nNearly 50 years ago, researchers found that using random, audio beeps on a tape recorder (beeper tape) helped test subjects stay focused better than others who:\n   -Depended on another person to prompt them to stay on task \n   -Relied upon reward systems as incentive\n   -Used medication exclusively\n\nDevelop Self-Regulation \nOriginal Beeper App™, developed by a licensed mental health provider is designed to allow you to assess your own level of attention on any given task and to record these results. \n\nThis is important because research shows that a person who can self-monitor their attentiveness and focus, whether through using a beep tape or some other cueing device, will consistently increase in on-task behavior, accuracy and performance. \n\nSelf-regulation strategies are proven to be effective procedures for increasing on-task behavior above and beyond the gains typically associated with medications or other external methods. \n\n\n\nFlexible and Customizable \nYou can set the timer, sound and frequency of your beeper prompts to be exactly suited to your personal needs. You will quickly and easily determine the best settings for you. \n \nUse at School \nOriginal Beeper App™ is custom made for school implementation as well. It does not interfere with a teacher’s lesson, and it does not require constant teacher involvement to manage off-task behaviors. Lastly, since Original Beeper App™ is completely customizable for many situations that require sustained on-task behavior, it is the most effective resource for supporting on-task behavior in the real world, all over the world.    \n \nPossible Applications of Original Beeper App™\n1.     Complete chores at home more quickly\n2.     Independently focus on homework\n3.     Maintain clear attention on work projects\n4.     Get through college courses with confidence \n5.     Work quietly in classroom setting (any grade) \n6.     Apply your best effort on any other situation at school, work or home when sustained focus is expected.\n\n\nWhat Users have already experienced Using Original Beeper App -\n\nThe beeps feel like guardrails keeping focus steadily flowing between the lines. If having a day where they are more distracted, increasing the frequency of the beeps tightens the guardrails. \n\nThe randomness of the beeps (at any frequency) is helpful because it prevents the mind from finding a pattern and coasting. It’s like driving on a curvy road instead of a straight one. \n\nThe beeps help users automatically check in and adjust their focus. If their thoughts are drifting out of the lane, the beep brings them right back where they need to be to stay on-task. \n\n\n*NEVER USE WHEN DRIVING/OPERATING ANY VEHICLE/ MACHINERY\n\n\nvisit originalbeeperapp.com for complete information"

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

If you are feeling paranoid, you can disable auto-save entirely. You can also exclude websites that you never want to auto-save.\n\nYou can use it as a read-it-later app, but I mostly use it as a search app.\n\nFor privacy reasons, History Book stores your browsing history in iCloud. Apart from the iCloud sync, History Book does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.\n\nHistory Book has no in-app purchases, no ads, and no tracking. It’s a universal purchase, so you only have to buy it once to use it on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\nCaveat:\n- The app uses readability.js to check whether a webpage is readable. It is likely to produce both false positives and false negatives.\n- The app is written in SwiftUI, which means there are some not-quite-standard behaviors and UI bugs that I can’t fix.\n- The app uses iCloud for syncing.\n\nNote: The “can read and alter webpages” text in the permission section is just unfortunate wording. History Book needs access to the web page to save the content. It’s not doing anything creepy!"

      "label": "Habeets is a simple habit-tracking app designed to help you achieve your goals and create a better version of yourself. If you want to create better habits (workout, eat healthily, save more money, etc), or ditch your bad ones (drinking, smoking, etc), Habeets can help you achieve that. You will still need to do the hard work, though...\n\nCORE VALUES\n- Form or ditch any type of habit\n- Easy to use\n- Packed with all the features you need\n- All your habits are for your eyes only. Neither I nor Apple can read your data.\n- No extra payments, subscriptions, or ads\n- Automatically synchronize your data across all your devices\n- Support for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac (Apple Silicon)\n- Beautifully crafted graphs and insights\n- Dark mode\n- Set reminders\n\n\nMAKE YOUR GOALS A REALITY\nShows how far you've come and how much you've improved. Encourages you to keep going when things get tough. Finally, break those bad habits that have been holding you back for years\n\nSIMPLE, EASY, AND FAST\nHabeets is a straightforward, simple, and elegant solution to help you in your journey, that will become part of your day.\n\nIMPROVE EVERY DAY\nTrack days that you missed or skipped, and make it work next time.\nForm all types of recurring habits: Weekly, Interval, and Customized.\n\nNO EXTRA PAYMENTS\nI believe that helping you achieve your goals is more important than anything else. Nowadays almost every app requires subscriptions or they just have ads everywhere.\nHabeets doesn't have any premium features. You'll receive all features already unlocked. No subscriptions, no additional payments, or ads.\nPay once, and use forever. That's it.\nHelping you become better and better by using this app is what matters to me.\n\nYOUR PRIVACY MATTERS\nHabeets is focused on privacy. We don't track you or your habits. We don't send any data to 3rd parties. Your habits data never leaves your phone or its iCloud backups. None of your habits data is saved to a server (except iCloud's servers).\n\nREMINDERS\nGo mind-free all day setting reminders for your habits. Set up an alarm for when you need to do something important like drink water or meditate. You'll never miss a chance to keep moving forward.\n\nANYTIME. ANYWHERE\nI designed Habeets so you can use it anytime, anywhere. From your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch. This will help you continue your habits wherever you go.\nFor example, you can use your Apple Watch to track habits when your iPhone is not around.\nAll your data is encrypted and automatically synched throught all your devices.\n\n\n\"Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\" - James Clear (Atomic Habits)\n\nThank you for reading until here. I wish you nothing but the best in your journey.\n\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://habeets.com/privacy-policy/"

Use this user-friendly, automated time study tool to optimize your operation!\n\nBetter working methods boost efficiency and decrease fatigue in workers. Effectiveness not just about how hard you work, but how smart. These time & motion studies enhance your ability to optimize both your operational processes (increase throughput) and efficiency (resource utilization).\n\nHow do we do this? When you know how much time and movements particular tasks require, you can most effectively appropriate the optimal amount of labor & material resources. Decreased costs is another advantage as a result (labor & material cost savings).\n\nThese time studies are best utilized for:\n1. Machine cycle time verification\n2. Manual employee functions that incorporate repetitive tasks in a retail, manufacturing/production, distribution and/or other operational environment.\n\nTo start a time study:\n1. Tap “New Time Study”\n2. Choose number of tasks in each job cycle\n3. Name tasks/elements\n4. Tap “Start”\n\nPro Tip: Remember to measure how much time workers save after implementing changes to provide a clear, transparent ROI business case back to the business."

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

      "label": "Scene Study is an incredibly easy way for actors to learn their lines, memorize scenes and rehearse for theater and film productions. Created by actors for actors, Scene Study frees you from the script to start actively listening and responding in the scene. By recording your cues lines, you practice listening for them right along with recalling your own. \n\nOnce you have a scene set up, save time by rehearsing while doing other activities. Combining other tasks with rehearsal enables deeper memorization of your lines and often provides a few unexpected insights to your character. \n\nGetting started is easy. Simply create a production, add characters, then start recording your character's spoken and cue lines. Record the full lines for your scene partners or just the cue lines. Then start rehearsing!\n\nChoose the character you wish to rehearse by muting them during playback and enjoy your own portable scene partner. Rehearse around the house or on the go, rehearse while driving or doing chores. It’s that easy! \n\nFeatures \n\n- Dress rehearsal mode!\n- Line prompting to speed memorization.\n- Streamlined recording interface.\n- Lock screen audio controls integration.\n- Great for single scene and full length productions.\n- Shared character lists for productions.\n- Streamlined scene screen enables playback and recording from one screen. \n- Playback all scene lines or mute a character to rehearse lines from memory.\n- Drag and drop line reordering.\n- Auto-save recordings for fast scene creation.\n- Headphone and bluetooth support for limitless rehearsal opportunities."

See why so many artists, teachers and students are using CopyIt as an essential tool in their workflows.\n\nNEW USERS - PLEASE NOTE:\nDue to the large number of features in CopyIt, the toolbars are scrollable.  Try scrolling each toolbar to access all of the available buttons.\n\nUsed by artists such as Vincent Van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci, the grid drawing method has been brought to digital life with CopyIt. CopyIt assists you in copying, enlarging or reducing your chosen reference image using the grid drawing method. You do not even need to be artistic.\n\nThe grid drawing method has been used for centuries. It breaks images down into smaller work areas allowing you to focus on the actual lines and shapes within each square, rather than trying to draw the whole picture at once. You can't help but achieve with this method.\n\nUsing CopyIt as your reference object, it saves you from having to print your photos and ruin them by drawing grids over them, but unlike a real photo, it gives you the ability to zoom into the fine details.  With a pencil, you then draw up a grid with the same number of squares using a separate medium, such as paper or canvas. Working square by square, you CopyIt!\n\nIf you want to draw an image larger or smaller than the original, the pencil-drawn grid should be drawn larger or smaller than the original grid on the device with the same amount of squares.  All that matters is that the contents of each square are drawn to scale.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Comprehensive Help\n- Portrait or Landscape orientation\n- Universal App, compatible with iPad, iPhone and iPod touch\n- Fullscreen mode (hides toolbars)\n- Built-in Music player\n- Audible feedback (can be turned off)\n- Extra options in the Settings App\n- Set your Maximum Zoom level from x1 to x20\n- CopyIt can resist entering standby while in use\n- TubeMatch™ for approximating paint and pencil colours\n- Mosaic to average surrounding colours into coloured squares\n- Tonal Strip to help identify values\n- Media types (Imperial and Metric)\n\nGrid Options:\n- 6 Grid Types\n- Preset or custom Columns, Rows and Points grid sizing options\n- To maintain the grid visibility regardless of your photo, choose from 9 grid colors, Black (default), Gray, White, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange and Magenta\n- Grid transparency is adjustable in 5% increments \n- 5 different Grid Line thicknesses\n- Grid letters and numbers (now 8 different formats)\n- A center point in each grid square \n- Guidelines: 1/4 and 1/16 to help you copy your subject\n- Solid or Dashed Guidelines\n- Guideline colour can be set independently to Grid colour\n- SmartMove: Just touch a square once to zoom to that square\n- SmartMove: takes advantage of your maximum zoom setting, never zooming in more than that amount\n- Target mode highlights the current square and dims the rest, helping you to focus your attention\n\nFilters and Effects:\n- 12 Primary Filters\n- 6 Secondary Filters\n- Onion Skin Feature: Overlay your reference image above your work to quickly assess your accuracy\n- 12 different image aspects \n- Rotate the image in 90 degree increments\n- Vertical and Horizontal Flip image\n\nImport Options:\n- Cameras are supported - both front and back\n- Load Project\n- Load From Photo Album\n\nExport Options:\n- Save Project\n- Export Photo (AirDrop, email, message, print, export to Facebook, Twitter etc)\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to use CopyIt, a user guide is available within the App and on the Support website.\n\nYou can contact the developer on Facebook or Twitter.\nwww.facebook.com/CopyItTheGridDrawingMethod or @copyitforios\n\nThank you to all our users for their feedback and feature suggestions which have helped make CopyIt what it is today."

Enter the dimensions of the room and the heat input of the appliance and the calculator will find the vent size required or advise if no vent is needed or that the appliance should not be fitted in that room.\n\nOpen Flue:\nEnter the appliance heat input and select whether adventitious air is available or if the appliance is in a compartment and the calculator will find the required vent sizes.\n\nMultiple Rooms:\nFor an open flue appliance where the path to outside is via another room use the 'Walls to outside' option within the Open Flue Calculator to select the number of walls vents need to be fitted into. It will also take into account  adventitious air or if the appliance in a compartment as per the selected options.\n\nRoom Sealed:\nFor a room sealed appliance simply enter the heat input and the calculator will find the vent sizes required if the appliance is in a compartment.\n\nMultiple Appliances:\nFor multiple appliances in one room this app simply provides a guide to remind you of the regulations. The other calculators will then need to be used to find the required vent size.\n\nExtractor Fan:\nTo find the required performance of a fan for a room enter the room dimensions and type and the performance will be found using pre-set air change rates. A manual ACH can be entered also.\n\nVent Size:\nA calculator is included to find the total size of a vent with rectangular or circular holes."

For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused.

To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees.

An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

On iPad, it also hides comments.\n\nWhen you want to see the hidden elements, you can toggle them on by tapping on the extension.\n\nThe app is open source and does not collect any data.

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Roku.\n\n* Supported Roku TVs: Hisense, Sharp, TCL, Insignia, Hitachi, Philips, Element, JVC\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Roku must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Roku or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "A study carried out by Worcester Bosch Group's technical support team found that the most common cause of a boiler installation problem was from incorrectly sized gas pipes. When fitting a new boiler, often the existing pipes should be replace for larger ones due to the increased output. Smaller pipes will mean the boiler is running at a lower power and can cause an increase in carbon monoxide levels.\n\nThe Gas Pipe Sizing Calculator is an extremely easy to use app that will help you to select the right size pipes for installations using copper (up to 108mm), steel (up to 300mm) and PE (up to 315mm) pipes of sections up to 250m (820ft) in length. \n\nTo carry out a calculation simply select the gas type, enter the appliance heat input, enter the pipe length, the number of high or low loss fittings (guidance is given in the app), select the type of pipe and then press the 'Calculate' button. \n\nThe results will show the total equivalent length, the minimum pipe diameter (metric) that should be used and the pressure drop for that section of pipe.\n\nFor multiple appliances each section should be calculated in turn and the kW inputs for the appliances in each section added together for each calculation.\n\nThe maximum pressure drop from each appliance to the meter should be no more than 1 mbar for natural gas or 2.5 mbar for butane or propane. Adding all drops together using the minimum pipe diameters may cause this to be exceeded. Where possible, the results will also calculate the drop if the next larger size pipe diameter is selected on a section, this should help to ensure the right sizes are used throughout the whole circuit.\n\nPlease note: This app is designed mainly for the UK so supports metric pipe sizes only."

      "label": "The Heatloss Calculator & Guide from Mr Combi Training includes three useful calculators:\n\n• Heatloss calculator - finds the heatloss from a room\n• Radiator calculator - estimates a radiator's length/output\n• Converter - quickly converts between Watts and BTU/h\n\nHeatloss Calculator:\nThis easy to use calculator lets you enter the details for a room, with dimensions in metres or feet, and it will then will calculate the heatloss in Watts and BTUs per hour. The desired room temperatures (12 - 24°C) can be set in the settings page and also the outside temperature (-30 to +5°C) the temperatures are also given in their Fahrenheit equivalents.\n\nThe results will show:\n\n• Ventilation heatloss - Losses from air passing through the room.\n• Fabric heatloss - Losses through walls, floor and ceiling.\n• Total heatloss - Sum of the ventilation and fabric losses.\n\nThe required radiator for the room can then be determined from the total room heat loss i.e. select a radiator that's rated higher!\n\nThe app can also be used to work out how much could be saved by fitting double glazing, cavity insulation or extra loft insulation to your home. Carry out a survey of each room in your house, with and without the double glazing/cavity insulation/loft insulation, then total the differences for the whole house to find how much heat is being wasted.\n\nThe app will even also calculate the time taken to heat the room from the set outside temperature if the right radiator is fitted. You can also enter flow and return rates and the Mean Water Temperature (MWT) and Delta T will be calculated, making it easier for you to select the right radiator using the manufacturers correction factors.\n\n\nRadiator Calculator:\nThis calculator will estimate the length or power output from an existing compact radiator using a range of calculations from the most popular radiator manufacturers in the UK.\n\nTo find the output you simply select the radiator type, select the height, enter the length (in mm or inches) and select the Delta T. The results will then show the lowest and highest power outputs from across the different manufacturers and then the average will be calculated. This is very useful if you want to show a customer that their radiator is too small for a room.\n\nTo find the estimated length select the radiator type, select the height, enter the output and select the Delta T. The results will then show the estimated length the radiator would need to be.\n\nThe following radiator types are supported:\n• P1 - Single panel\n• K1 - Single convector\n• P+ - Double panel\n• K2 - Double convector\n• K3 - Triple convector\n\n\nEmail, Save or Export:\nOnce you have your results you can email them directly from within the app, save them to your device or export them to another app that supports text files, such as Dropbox, Google Drive or Evernote.\n\nYou can also use the saved results to add up all the heatlosses from a house so you can find the total heating load.\n\n\nConverter:\nThe super simple Converter will help you quickly convert between Watts and BTU/h. Just enter one value and the other will be calculated.\n\n\nGuide:\nTo give you some extra help when you need it, we have added a mini-guide to the Radiator Calculator with the following 4 pages:\n• Correction factors - Shows you when and how to apply a correction factor to your results\n• DeltaT Calculations - How to calculate the MWT and DeltaT\n• Common Faults - Lists a number of common radiator faults, their symptoms and remedies\n• Balancing - Instructions for balancing a system"

Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

Simply select the type of gas, enter a value, select the units, press the 'Calculate' button and the calculator will show all gas rates (cubic metres per hour, cubic feet per hour and litres per second) and heat inputs (MJ/h, kW and BTUs per hour) based on the CV.\n\nThe Tightness Testing function allows you to quickly select between the let-by and tightness tests and has an easy to use timer. No longer do you need to fiddle about with your phone's timer!\n\nCalorific values can be entered manually (and saved) for more accurate gas rate calculation results. The calorific value of natural gas in the UK varies from about 38.3 to 40.5 MJ per cubic metre; this can mean a difference in the gas rate calculation of more than 5%! With this calculator you can add the CV for your area in the settings page and avoid these inaccuracies. The default values set for butane and propane are both the same as supplied by Calor and BOC.\n\nThe metric timer can be set to either 1 or 2 minutes. For U6 and G4 meters one minute is sufficient, for E6 meters two minutes is recommended for accuracy. The timer can be set to an audible alert, vibrate, both or neither.\n\nA torch function is included with this app if your device has an LED flash."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

If your device could not capture movie, then, could try out a smaller output resolution (by tapping the control pane). However, arbitrary output size may stop capturing prematurely.\n\nNew feature: Design 3D model animation with skeleton structure.  \nYou could design a skeleton structure by placing bones in hierarchical relation.  Attach model to the skeleton, and then moving the bones to define different poses.  Each pose represented as a keyframe in the timeline view.  And animation sequence is produced by playing interpolation between the keyframes.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nFeatures:\n- Import 3D content directly from browser or email, either in .zip, .rar, .7z.\n- Support formats: Collada DAE, OBJ, 3DS, STL(for 3D printing), and others.\n- Import/export to iCloud drive, via iTune File Sharing, or to Public area via Apple CloudKit Service.\n- Supports AirDrop.\n- Support Quad faces.\n- Smooth surfaces using Subdivision.\n- Mirroring editing.\n- 2-fingers vertex movement, 3 or 4-fingers planar shape creation.\n- Versatile multi-touches drag-through-space gestures to support editing and changing viewing angle at the same time.\n- Flexible face strip drawing.\n- Stitching boundary faces.

      "label": "Hang-a-Pic greatly simplifies the tedious and sometimes difficult task of hanging multiple, equally aligned pictures, mirrors, decorative plates, candles or any other wall mounted ornaments. Of course, hanging one picture is simple. But if you have three or four pictures, each with two hooks on the back, and you want them exactly 6 inches apart, and aligned correctly across your wall? Hang-a-Pic will do just that!\n\nUsing a very friendly walk-through interface, Hang-a-Pic can tell you exactly where to put your nails (or wall-plugs, etc.) in the wall for each picture or ornament. No more headaches or extra holes in the wall from guessing where the nails should go... All you need is a tape measure and Hang-a-Pic will figure out the rest!\n\nIt's so easy that a 12 year old child could take four pictures, each with two hooks on the back, and hang them precisely and evenly across a wall the first time! No extra holes, no \"oops!!\".\n\n- New Features added to support hanging a group of pictures (or anything else) with different frame widths, evenly spaced across a wall. For example, say you're hanging 3 pictures and the center picture is wider than the other 2, Hang-a-Pic will now make this an easy task to pinpoint exactly where your nails need to be for each picture! \n- Now supports as many as 5 pictures (or any thing else you're hanging), and each can be a different width. And they do *not* need to be hung symmetrically! \n- Send measurements to your Email address.\n- Print the measurements to your AirPrint compatible Printer.\n- Performance enhancements.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Hang-a-Pic does not calculate how high you wish to hang pictures, mirrors, etc.. Some prefer staggering the height of each picture, some prefer hanging them all the same height. The height you wish to hang pictures is your particular visual preference. For example, do want them at eye-level or higher up on a wall with very tall ceilings? etc.. It's up to you. Hang-a-Pic will however, calculate perfect spacing between those pictures horizontally."

You can see the exact position of text frames and their content, position of graphic frames and linked objects. When the graphic is embedded in the document, it is shown in the preview.\nThis presents a useful way of reviewing document progress when on the move.\n\nThe stories in the document can be opened for reading, making the review more comfortable than in pdf. The app can get documents directly from your team's dropbox, making you up to date with the work progress at any moment.\n\nUpgrade to full version, where the text in the document can be edited and saved is available.\n\nThe app contains neither InDesign's paragraph composer, nor advanced image processing tools. The preview will not reflect text position 1:1 with InDesign and some vector graphic attributes are simplified. PDF preview gives you more accuracy, iDML gives you a better idea about document composition."

That includes all effects. They do not need to be previously edited into the stream, you can do that while you are streaming from your camera. And the effects will not be lost if you decide to record the stream!\n\nNOTE:\nAir Camera works best if both AppleTV and iOS are updated to the newest version!\n\nThere are some things to keep in mind when streaming sound from a microphone, consider the steps below to make your work more enjoyable:\n    • Reduce Gain/Volume in case of feedback\n    • Experiment with different positions of the iOS device to have additional gain before feedback available\n    • Use an external microphone to plug in your iOS device\n    • Adjust speaker position\nDo not hesitate to drop a line to tell us how you like our app, and also if you don't like it.

      "label": "Have you ever been concerned about online privacy? Would you mind someone reading your mail? If your answer is \"Yes\" then SenseMail is for you! Protect your communications with this state-of-the-art application. SenseMail is easy to use, a secure e-mail client for your favorite email providers. We thought of every possible threat to your data when we created this app.\n\nSenseMail protects your privacy from the application launch to reading your messages. No data leaves your device or is stored unprotected. SenseMail uses industry-standard algorithms to ensure that your information is safe. We protect it with AES-256 encryption with compression and secure hashes, and we never send or store your data unencrypted. Without a password, no one can read your messages. The use of slow crucial 1-2-second derivation functions to convert your passwords into keys makes brute-forcing economically unfeasible with a password longer than six symbols. You can also add multiple mail accounts to SenseMail, and you can create several completely independent profiles, only enter a profile's password for access. The app will never complain about a wrong password: it will show what it takes for it to make a guess harder.\nTo launch the app, you need to enter a pin that protects your local storage. To send a message, you need to enter a password that the recipient must know to read your mail. If you wish, you can use a unique password for each recipient or even for every message. You can also exchange keys with the other party, tap in a password, and your email will be protected with a 256-bit certificate that is much more secure than a password.\nThe price you pay for the security is a short delay before you open a message or access your data. However, we did our best to make SenseMail easy to use and to get a positive user experience.\n\nKey features are:\n- All your data, such as messages, settings, contacts, notes, and images are secure\n- We have no means to recover your data or passwords should you forget it\n- SenseMail uses public e-mail service providers. Gmail works best!\n- No message storage on your device.\n- Supports pre-exchanged 256-bit keys to provide maximum security\n- There are two password types – one to enter the app to secure your local data. The other is to encrypt a message you send\n- AES-256, HMAC, PBKDF2, SHA-256, gzip algorithms for protection\n- Connects to virtually any IMAP mail provider\n- Combined Inbox folder for all your accounts\n- Read/send unencrypted messages\n- Has built-in server settings for major e-mail providers\n- Secure storage for image gallery, contacts, and notes\n\nKnown limitations:\n- Only one recipient for a message (for security reasons – do not use the same password for several people)\n- Cannot save drafts (again, for security reasons – we do not store any irrelevant data on a device)\n- Attachments count is not limited but is it advised to keep it below 10 for optimal memory usage (i.e., for iPod touch)\n- Only IMAP TLS is supported (security reason again)\n- No searches on message body or subject for protected e-mails (since you need to enter a password to gain access to it)\n- No push"

Prepare speaker's notes and deliver a great speech — perfectly timed — no matter what the occasion.\n\nBe it a wedding speech, sermon, business presentation, or evening at the debating club, navigating your notes is that much easier with Speeches as your portable teleprompter.\n\nPrepare your notes directly in Speeches on your iPhone or iPad, or import a text file from Mail or another App (e.g. Dropbox, Files). You can also email your speech to solicit feedback from friends and colleagues, and your speeches sync between devices with iCloud.\n\nSpeeches helps with your preparation. Organize notes, set a speech duration, and practice to make sure you can finish on time. Having difficulty with a particular section? Jump to any note and continue from there.\n\nOnce your speech is prepared, it's time to deliver. Speeches presents your notes as easy to navigate cue cards. No more juggling of paper notes, or fiddly scrolling in an App not designed for the pressure of public speaking. Just swipe back and forth. Simple gestures keep you focussed on speaking, and not on negotiating your notes.\n\nSpeeches goes well beyond paper notes when it comes to keeping track of your time. The onscreen timing meter shows at a glance exactly how far along you are. A second bar shows your progress through the notes. By comparing the two, you can see if you are going too fast or too slow.\n\nIn short, Speeches is the App you need to write, practice and deliver your next speech with precision and confidence.\n\nF E A T U R E S\n\n– Universal app optimized for both iPhone and iPad\n– Keep speeches in sync between your devices with iCloud\n– Prepare speaker's notes on your iOS devices\n– Swipe through cue cards to practice your speech\n– Unique timing meter shows time and progress through notes\n– Set speech duration down to the second\n– Import text files from Mail, Files and Dropbox\n– Split any note in two while editing\n– Mail your speeches to others\n– Customize font and font size of notes\n– Set speech category"

The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher or key size.\n• Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\n• The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\n• Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.\n\nFor more info see http://www.awallet.org/\n\nIf you like this App, rate it in the App Store.

      "label": "Congratulations! You’ve just discovered the app that perfects the process of improved attention and focus. Old science has taught us new ways to unlock the power of your brain to stay focused and attentive, even on tasks where it feels nearly impossible. With this app you will experience consistent increases in: \n\n\t-Sustained attention \n\t-Increased focus\n\t-Consistent on-task behavior\n\nYou will become less distracted and more productive, even on the most boring of tasks. \n\nOld Science + New Technology = Earned Success \nNearly 50 years ago, researchers found that using random, audio beeps on a tape recorder (beeper tape) helped test subjects stay focused better than others who:\n   -Depended on another person to prompt them to stay on task \n   -Relied upon reward systems as incentive\n   -Used medication exclusively\n\nDevelop Self-Regulation \nOriginal Beeper App™, developed by a licensed mental health provider is designed to allow you to assess your own level of attention on any given task and to record these results. \n\nThis is important because research shows that a person who can self-monitor their attentiveness and focus, whether through using a beep tape or some other cueing device, will consistently increase in on-task behavior, accuracy and performance. \n\nSelf-regulation strategies are proven to be effective procedures for increasing on-task behavior above and beyond the gains typically associated with medications or other external methods. \n\n\n\nFlexible and Customizable \nYou can set the timer, sound and frequency of your beeper prompts to be exactly suited to your personal needs. You will quickly and easily determine the best settings for you. \n \nUse at School \nOriginal Beeper App™ is custom made for school implementation as well. It does not interfere with a teacher’s lesson, and it does not require constant teacher involvement to manage off-task behaviors. Lastly, since Original Beeper App™ is completely customizable for many situations that require sustained on-task behavior, it is the most effective resource for supporting on-task behavior in the real world, all over the world.    \n \nPossible Applications of Original Beeper App™\n1.     Complete chores at home more quickly\n2.     Independently focus on homework\n3.     Maintain clear attention on work projects\n4.     Get through college courses with confidence \n5.     Work quietly in classroom setting (any grade) \n6.     Apply your best effort on any other situation at school, work or home when sustained focus is expected.\n\n\nWhat Users have already experienced Using Original Beeper App -\n\nThe beeps feel like guardrails keeping focus steadily flowing between the lines. If having a day where they are more distracted, increasing the frequency of the beeps tightens the guardrails. \n\nThe randomness of the beeps (at any frequency) is helpful because it prevents the mind from finding a pattern and coasting. It’s like driving on a curvy road instead of a straight one. \n\nThe beeps help users automatically check in and adjust their focus. If their thoughts are drifting out of the lane, the beep brings them right back where they need to be to stay on-task. \n\n\n*NEVER USE WHEN DRIVING/OPERATING ANY VEHICLE/ MACHINERY\n\n\nvisit originalbeeperapp.com for complete information"

      "label": "First released in June 2010, CopyIt is the original and most feature rich grid drawing app available anywhere! See why so many artists, teachers and students are using CopyIt as an essential tool in their workflows.\n\nNEW USERS - PLEASE NOTE:\nDue to the large number of features in CopyIt, the toolbars are scrollable.  Try scrolling each toolbar to access all of the available buttons.\n\nUsed by artists such as Vincent Van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci, the grid drawing method has been brought to digital life with CopyIt. CopyIt assists you in copying, enlarging or reducing your chosen reference image using the grid drawing method. You do not even need to be artistic.\n\nThe grid drawing method has been used for centuries. It breaks images down into smaller work areas allowing you to focus on the actual lines and shapes within each square, rather than trying to draw the whole picture at once. You can't help but achieve with this method.\n\nUsing CopyIt as your reference object, it saves you from having to print your photos and ruin them by drawing grids over them, but unlike a real photo, it gives you the ability to zoom into the fine details.  With a pencil, you then draw up a grid with the same number of squares using a separate medium, such as paper or canvas. Working square by square, you CopyIt!\n\nIf you want to draw an image larger or smaller than the original, the pencil-drawn grid should be drawn larger or smaller than the original grid on the device with the same amount of squares.  All that matters is that the contents of each square are drawn to scale.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Comprehensive Help\n- Portrait or Landscape orientation\n- Universal App, compatible with iPad, iPhone and iPod touch\n- Fullscreen mode (hides toolbars)\n- Built-in Music player\n- Audible feedback (can be turned off)\n- Extra options in the Settings App\n- Set your Maximum Zoom level from x1 to x20\n- CopyIt can resist entering standby while in use\n- TubeMatch™ for approximating paint and pencil colours\n- Mosaic to average surrounding colours into coloured squares\n- Tonal Strip to help identify values\n- Media types (Imperial and Metric)\n\nGrid Options:\n- 6 Grid Types\n- Preset or custom Columns, Rows and Points grid sizing options\n- To maintain the grid visibility regardless of your photo, choose from 9 grid colors, Black (default), Gray, White, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange and Magenta\n- Grid transparency is adjustable in 5% increments \n- 5 different Grid Line thicknesses\n- Grid letters and numbers (now 8 different formats)\n- A center point in each grid square \n- Guidelines: 1/4 and 1/16 to help you copy your subject\n- Solid or Dashed Guidelines\n- Guideline colour can be set independently to Grid colour\n- SmartMove: Just touch a square once to zoom to that square\n- SmartMove: takes advantage of your maximum zoom setting, never zooming in more than that amount\n- Target mode highlights the current square and dims the rest, helping you to focus your attention\n\nFilters and Effects:\n- 12 Primary Filters\n- 6 Secondary Filters\n- Onion Skin Feature: Overlay your reference image above your work to quickly assess your accuracy\n- 12 different image aspects \n- Rotate the image in 90 degree increments\n- Vertical and Horizontal Flip image\n\nImport Options:\n- Cameras are supported - both front and back\n- Load Project\n- Load From Photo Album\n\nExport Options:\n- Save Project\n- Export Photo (AirDrop, email, message, print, export to Facebook, Twitter etc)\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to use CopyIt, a user guide is available within the App and on the Support website.\n\nYou can contact the developer on Facebook or Twitter.\nwww.facebook.com/CopyItTheGridDrawingMethod or @copyitforios\n\nThank you to all our users for their feedback and feature suggestions which have helped make CopyIt what it is today."

Simply input when you completed the currency and how long it is valid for, and its expiry date is automatically calculated; or for irregular currencies you can manually input the expiry date instead, giving you maximum control. Your currencies list is colour-coded and can be sorted 'expiring soonest', 'completed recently' or 'alphabetically', making it simple for you to prioritise what's important.\n\nCurrency Genie also reminds you in advance of your currencies expiring, and again on the expiration date, ensuring you never forget to book that all important simulator trip again. There's no limit to what you can add; from medical and dental assessments, to instrument ratings and airworthiness certifications.\n\nCurrency Genie: The Flying Currencies Tracker."

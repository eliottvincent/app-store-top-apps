Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n• Create personalized Allow Lists for different situations. Non-allowed apps will be blocked.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date.

Works for US and other regions too, but it might feel a bit strange. ###\n\nCompare heating systems and different heat sources. See which one provides the cheapest solution for your case.\n\nOil boilers, gas boilers, heat pumps, wood, pellets, electricity. Compare costs of heating using different heating sources/generators. \n\nEstimate yearly cost of heating when replacing existing heating generator (boiler) with a new one.\n\nDeciding on replacing a heating generator (boiler)? Trying to figure out the solution with the lowest operating (yearly) cost? Or just wondering which heating generator currently offers the lowest cost of heating a building? This application might help.\n\nHeating Cost is an application that helps a consumer or a professional determine operating costs for different heating sources when replacing the existing heating generator. Calculation is based on current energy source consumption.\n\nFeatures:\n- Easy to use;\n- As little numeric input as possible;\n- Different heating generators compared directly from the same view (fast);\n- Customizable prices and currency (manual input);\n- Expert mode allows to compare two heating generators with more control over efficiencies;\n\nNote:\n- Metric units only.\n\nResults include energy (heat) consumption and yearly cost of heating for different energy sources and heating generators.\n\nHeat sources / generators covered:\n- heating oil (boilers with or without condensation),\n- natural gas (boilers with or without condensation),\n- LPG (boilers with or without condensation),\n- firewood,\n- wood chips,\n- pellets,\n- electricity,\n- heat pumps.\n\nNote:\n- Works only for existing heating generator replacement. Calculation is based on current system consumption.\n\nThe application does not contain ads. It also doesn't collect any personal or device information. No data connection is required for the app to work. No account is needed, works entirely on the device."

Simply select the type of gas, enter a value, select the units, press the 'Calculate' button and the calculator will show all gas rates (cubic metres per hour, cubic feet per hour and litres per second) and heat inputs (MJ/h, kW and BTUs per hour) based on the CV.\n\nThe Tightness Testing function allows you to quickly select between the let-by and tightness tests and has an easy to use timer. No longer do you need to fiddle about with your phone's timer!\n\nCalorific values can be entered manually (and saved) for more accurate gas rate calculation results. The calorific value of natural gas in the UK varies from about 38.3 to 40.5 MJ per cubic metre; this can mean a difference in the gas rate calculation of more than 5%! With this calculator you can add the CV for your area in the settings page and avoid these inaccuracies. The default values set for butane and propane are both the same as supplied by Calor and BOC.\n\nThe metric timer can be set to either 1 or 2 minutes. For U6 and G4 meters one minute is sufficient, for E6 meters two minutes is recommended for accuracy. The timer can be set to an audible alert, vibrate, both or neither.\n\nA torch function is included with this app if your device has an LED flash."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research?

      "label": "Habeets is a simple habit-tracking app designed to help you achieve your goals and create a better version of yourself. If you want to create better habits (workout, eat healthily, save more money, etc), or ditch your bad ones (drinking, smoking, etc), Habeets can help you achieve that. You will still need to do the hard work, though...\n\nCORE VALUES\n- Form or ditch any type of habit\n- Easy to use\n- Packed with all the features you need\n- All your habits are for your eyes only. Neither I nor Apple can read your data.\n- No extra payments, subscriptions, or ads\n- Automatically synchronize your data across all your devices\n- Support for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac (Apple Silicon)\n- Beautifully crafted graphs and insights\n- Dark mode\n- Set reminders\n\n\nMAKE YOUR GOALS A REALITY\nShows how far you've come and how much you've improved. Encourages you to keep going when things get tough. Finally, break those bad habits that have been holding you back for years\n\nSIMPLE, EASY, AND FAST\nHabeets is a straightforward, simple, and elegant solution to help you in your journey, that will become part of your day.\n\nIMPROVE EVERY DAY\nTrack days that you missed or skipped, and make it work next time.\nForm all types of recurring habits: Weekly, Interval, and Customized.\n\nNO EXTRA PAYMENTS\nI believe that helping you achieve your goals is more important than anything else. Nowadays almost every app requires subscriptions or they just have ads everywhere.\nHabeets doesn't have any premium features. You'll receive all features already unlocked. No subscriptions, no additional payments, or ads.\nPay once, and use forever. That's it.\nHelping you become better and better by using this app is what matters to me.\n\nYOUR PRIVACY MATTERS\nHabeets is focused on privacy. We don't track you or your habits. We don't send any data to 3rd parties. Your habits data never leaves your phone or its iCloud backups. None of your habits data is saved to a server (except iCloud's servers).\n\nREMINDERS\nGo mind-free all day setting reminders for your habits. Set up an alarm for when you need to do something important like drink water or meditate. You'll never miss a chance to keep moving forward.\n\nANYTIME. ANYWHERE\nI designed Habeets so you can use it anytime, anywhere. From your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch. This will help you continue your habits wherever you go.\nFor example, you can use your Apple Watch to track habits when your iPhone is not around.\nAll your data is encrypted and automatically synched throught all your devices.\n\n\n\"Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\" - James Clear (Atomic Habits)\n\nThank you for reading until here. I wish you nothing but the best in your journey.\n\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://habeets.com/privacy-policy/"

Doing the laundry is an epic feat of stamina so why not get stamina points for it?!\n\nThe to-do list is fully-featured and supports repeating tasks, displays reminders for overdue events and allows time-critical events to be assigned to specific days, while more aspirational quests can be set to \"someday\" so you don't lose sight of your goals. And each task completed is destroyed by your avatar, so get your Undead Warrior to beat-up your laundry, or your Treeman to headbutt your overspilling inbox.\n\nThe app is supplied with 5 animated avatars which grow in characteristics that represent your own life.

      "label": "‘Hand Tuber’ is a simple to use tubing offset calculator, and offers the field tubing specialist a handy tool to accurately place stainless instrument or copper tubing bend offsets in the field, utilising its in-built bender library and specialized calculations for both Metric and Imperial measurements.\n\nThis tool has been specifically developed to calculate for all bend angles, and not just 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°, for those times where tubes are required to be run between obstacles such as beams, cable ladders, and pipework.\n\n‘Hand Tuber’ also allows you the benefit of being able to add your own specific Rotary Draw Tube Bender to the bender choices in the library.\n\nImperial and metric benders are included in the inbuilt bender library, and the calculator can be used with both inches and millimeters as a unit of measure with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nIn a Nutshell:\n\n•\tSeven common Tubing Offset calculations included in the program.\n•\tCan be used for most Rotary Draw type benders (Center Line Radius)\n•\tAll results are calculated by using the tube center and/or bender radius.\n•\tAll calculations are based on trigonometry formula giving precision.\n•\tHand Tuber can be set up for either inches or millimeters.\n•\tThe most common Imperial and Metric bender profiles are included.\n•\tAdd new benders in ‘Add Benders’, and build a new bender profile.\n•\tMaintains a History of your previous completed bend calculations.\n•\tHelp screens included for all bend offsets and are quickly accessible.\n•\tMost calculations are completed on a single screen.\n•\tHandy graphics show the calculation results as a visual reference.\n•\tAdjustment, Offset, and Seating Allowance reference charts included.\n•\tHandy standard calculator function within the app.\n•\tEase of navigation to switch pages quickly and directly.\n•\tAccess to Online Tubing Manual via a handy link from the app.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line:\n\nFast on screen calculations, no need to use ‘cast offs’ to find that bend position.\nHelps to save wastage and reduce that ‘Bone Pile’ or stock of ‘Future Bends’.\nSaves time in working out those common and tricky offsets quickly.\nFinds the answer when the ‘Measure then Bend’ technique won’t work.\nVery handy, fits in your pocket or bag on your mobile device.\n\nOffsets and Calculations Included in the Current Release:\n\nSimple Offset: \nThe simple offset calculates the position of the second bend in a standard 2 bend offset, based on the previous Pre-Bent angle and the offset required for any angle between 0° and 90°.\n\nPredictive Offset:\nThe predictive offset calculates the second bend in a standard 2 bend offset, based on the previous planned bend angle, and the required offset, before either bend in the offset has been bent for any angle between 0° and 90°.\n\nParallel Offset:\nThe parallel offset calculates the position adjustment of the bend in a parallel tube, by giving the +/- length needed in order to maintain a consistent spacing between tubes with a change in direction.\n\nLong Run Offset:\nThe Long Run Offset calculates the Slope Length and Bend Angle for long runs of tube with a fixed or known Offset and Run length.\n\nBack Bend Offset:\nThe Back Bend Offset calculates the bender 0° position, for a bend that folds back on itself at an angle greater than 90°. This is useful when running tube on beams and cross braces.\n\nJoint Offset:\nThe Joint offset calculates the measurements and offsets to aid in the positioning of an offset tube joint or connecter in a specific location, and gives the measurements to place the center of the joint.\n\nFall Calculation:\nThe Fall Calculator calculates the fall or Offset amount, over a set distance based on a fall ratio.\nThe usual fall minimum for tubing in instrumentation is 1:12 or 8.33%."

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Roku.\n\n* Supported Roku TVs: Hisense, Sharp, TCL, Insignia, Hitachi, Philips, Element, JVC\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Roku must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Roku or any other trademark mentioned here.

Under certain circumstances you are invited to adjust the maximum regulation width slightly and recalculate to perhaps reduce by one the number of spindles.

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "Carry your BibTeX libraries with you on your iPad and iPhone!\n\nA BibTeX library is a collection of bibliographic references (papers, books, reports, etc.), designed to work with the LaTeX typesetting system. Each library is stored in a specially-formatted text file (typically ending in .bib), which you can create with your favourite text editor.\n\nThe References app gives you an easy way to browse through and interact with your BibTeX libraries. You can scroll, search, follow links, and view file attachments. In particular:\n\n- The app creates links from DOIs, MathSciNet references, ACM IDs, and of course URLs.\n- The app understands elementary LaTeX, so if your titles and/or abstracts contain markup or mathematics (and if your LaTeX is simple enough) then the app can display them nicely.\n- If you used BibDesk or JabRef to create your library, the app can view your file attachments (e.g., PDFs that you have attached to your references).\n- You can view references grouped by keywords, if you use the Keywords field in your BibTeX libraries. You can also view all of your smart/static groups from BibDesk, and your dynamic/static groups from JabRef.\n- The app supports BibLaTeX libraries as well as classic BibTeX.\n\nThe References app can open BibTeX libraries from anywhere on your device. In particular, you can use iCloud Drive to keep them synchronised between your devices.\n\nFILE ATTACHMENTS:\n\nTo view file attachments (e.g., PDFs), the path to each file should be included in the corresponding entry in your BibTeX library. You can do this using the specially encoded Bdsk-File-* fields (as used by BibDesk), or the plain text File field (as used by JabRef). If you are writing your BibTeX files by hand, just add a File field giving the location of the attachment, such as File = {../PDFs/foo.pdf}.\n\nAll paths are relative to the location of your BibTeX library (so if your BibTeX library is Documents/BibTeX/papers.bib and you encode an attachment as ../PDFs/foo.pdf, then the app will look for the file Documents/PDFs/foo.pdf). If your attachments are stored somewhere different, then you can just add their location as a new linked folder in the app, and the References app will still be able to find them.\n\nYou can view attachments from many places, including Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Nextcloud or OneDrive (all iOS versions), or iCloud Drive or anywhere on your iPhone/iPad (iOS 13+ only). If you are having trouble viewing attachments from a third-party provider, please mail the References developer with the details.\n\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\n\nTo learn more about BibTeX, see http://www.bibtex.org/ ."

GDPR compliant.\n* Synchronization of Safes between iPad, iPhone and Mac with iCloud or Wireless (without Internet)\n* Simple and intuitive usability, no technical knowledge is needed\n* Security made in Germany\n* Strong encryption with AES-256.\n* All files in a Safe are encrypted\n* Touch ID and Face ID supported\n* Files in a safe are also encrypted in iCloud Backup\n* Organize your files as you like it (create folders, rename, copy, move, duplicate, trash, delete files)\n* Picture Viewer and Slide Show in Full Screen mode\n* Show file content for Microsoft Office and iWork, PDF, RTF, TXT, Images, Text, Videos, Audio ...\n* Mark files and folders with tags or as Favorites for quick access\n* Add files from any App which supports Action Extensions or Document Provider Extension\n* Export files by using Share-Button or Document Provider Extension\n* Number of files and size is only limited by the free space of your device\n* Unlimited number of Safes\n* Add photos and videos from photo library directly from the App\n* Take encrypted photos or capture videos directly from the App and store them securely\n* Create and edit text files\n* Comment files\n* Create recovery password\n* Screen protection when in background\n* Access files in Safe from the Files App\n* View files in list or icon view (previews)\n* SimpleumSafe helps you to technically implement the required protection of documents with personal data in accordance with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)\n\nWHY CHOOSE SIMPLEUMSAFE?\nNowadays it is not enough “only” to encrypt your data to be protected. If you want to view or organize the encrypted files, they also must be protected. SimpleumSafe goes a different way than most other encryption programs. After authorization with a password, the files are not provided in the file system. Otherwise they would be completely vulnerable from this moment on. SimpleumSafe makes its own file system and has its own finder. Thus the files remain encrypted for the entire time.\n\nSYNCHRONIZATION\nSimpleumSafe was developed with Extreme Secure Synchronization - continuously encrypted. Even if the synchronization data was stolen from the cloud and the password became public, it is not possible to decrypt the data."

The result gives you the wind angle, crosswind and head/tail wind components.\n\nDELAY CODES\nWe use them on a daily basis but now it’s finally easy to look them up. Internal, passenger/baggage, cargo, handling, technical, damage/failure, operation, weather, air traffic control & miscellaneous… it’s all in there.\n\nDISTANCE\nObtain the distance between two airports. By entering the speed it will also provide the flight time and bearing information.\n\nMAX DAILY FDP\nShow the Flight Duty Period parameters by entering the start time and number of sectors.\n\nSNOWTAM DECODER\nDecode any SNOWTAM and see the result instantly.\n\nABBREVIATIONS\nAviation comes with an ever increasing amount of acronyms and abbreviations. Forgot one? We included over one thousand abbreviations in our database, just look them up.\n\nMY NOTES\nAdd personal notes to the app so you can keep all of your aviation related details in one place.\n\n---\n\nPreflight is a joined venture between DutchPilotGirl and MyPilotApps.

      "label": "Firetask empowers project-minded people to get things done efficiently.\n\nFrom capturing your thoughts and managing your to-dos to organizing and focusing on your most important tasks, Firetask combines David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD®) approach with Kanban task management in a unique way.\n\nFiretask is also available for *macOS* (sold separately) and syncs via iCloud.\n\nGETTING THINGS DONE®\n\nIf you don't know how GTD works here are some of the basic concepts:\n\n(1) Perform a \"brain dump\" -- collect all your open issues and tasks in your \"Inbox\"\n(2) Decide whether tasks are actionable, i.e., you want and can complete them yourself, whether you want to delegate them (Firetask provides a \"Waiting For\" list), or whether they are more of a \"someday/maybe\" thing\n(3) Organize your actionable tasks into so-called \"next action\" lists (Firetask provides \"projects\" for this)\n(4) Assign contexts to indicate, e.g., whether a task can only be done in a certain environment (e.g., you have to be \"Home\" to do clean up your house; we call this a \"category\")\n(5) Perform a weekly GTD review where you repeat steps 2-4 on a regular schedule in order to keep your trusted GTD task management system up-to-date\n\nWHY USE FIRETASK?\n\nFiretask provides a very logical implementation of GTD in a way that concepts such as the \"Inbox\" or \"Someday\" are implemented as task statuses; this way, categories (contexts) and project assignments can optionally be already associated within the Inbox and thus, making a task actionable only means changing its status to \"Actionable\".\n\nAlthough tasks do not have to be part of a project, projects are first class business objects in Firetask: they have their own statuses, you can organize them via \"portfolios\" (project folders) and you have full control over the order of tasks in a project. Successful project-oriented task management has never been easier.\n\nFiretask comes with great, visual tools that help you with your weekly GTD review such as \"Kanban\" and \"Dates\" views. Simply use drag & drop to move tasks between statuses, categories, priorities, due, or start dates.\n\nFiretask is also deeply integrated with the Apple ecosystem with optional integration with Reminders, Calendar events, Contacts, and syncing via iCloud.\n\nFiretask is available on iPhone, iPad, macOS, and Apple Watch providing you with a seamless user experience across platforms.\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Solid and logical implementation of GTD including dedicated \"Inbox\", \"Someday\", \"Upcoming\", and \"Waiting For\" lists\n* Uniquely focused \"Today\" view showing \"In Focus\" (things you want to do ASAP) as well as and overdue tasks\n* Practical \"Upcoming\" view showing upcoming due and next tasks at a glance\n* Optional support for the Pomodoro® Technique\n* Full support for simple project management via project task lists, portfolios for organizing projects, and actions for breaking down complex tasks into individual steps\n* Support for link attachments\n* Unique color and icon-based approach to task and project categories\n* Clean and at the same time visually rich user experience\n* Seamless syncing via iCloud\n* Optional integration with built-in Reminders, Calendar, and Contacts apps\n* Today widget and highly focused Apple Watch app providing quick access to Inbox, Today, Upcoming, and Waiting For lists"

      "label": "Ad And Stuff VPN Content Filter uses the VPN on the device to filter URLs, much like a hosts file, but better. It optionally blocks ads and porn.  Its settings allow you to do the following:\n\n-- set an internal IP address for the VPN in case the default one, 10.11.12.13, has a conflict on your LAN,\n-- restore the default internal IP address,\n-- optionally block ads and porn,\n-- add ad and porn hosts to be blocked or remove ones in its internal database to keep them from being blocked,\n-- change the DNS servers from OpenDNS to one of the several wired DNS providers or provide your own DNS servers,\n-- and restore the default DNS servers.\n\nIt works by routing DNS calls only through the VPN. The VPN replies with Unknown if the requested host is in the app's internal database. Otherwise, it passes the request to the DNS provider selected for the VPN. The only external calls explicitly made by the app are to the DNS provider - the app does not call home or anywhere else and does not collect any data, personal or otherwise.\n\nThe app is not ad supported and does not feed you ads. Any ads received are from whoever your web browser or other app is calling since that traffic does not go through the VPN. If you see any ads, then please let us know. Some ads are not be possible to block with this app. For instance, you will still get ads in YouTube videos because those ads come from youtube.com. So the only way to block those ads is to block youtube.com and get nothing from there."

It can also be used to measure vibrations of systems.\n\nThe app helps to locate if the vibration sources are the wheels or the cardan shaft. It is easy to setup. You can create a projects, specify the wheel size and gear ratio and start a measurement. Afterwards you get a chart of the measured vibrations. With the help of the project specific data and the speed the potential frequencies of tires ans gear shaft are calculated and displayed in the chart.\n\nThe accelerometer of your device is used for the measurement. Currently a maximum of 50 Hz can be detected. Frequencies less than 5 Hz are visually filtered out. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to find the frequency components of the vibrations.\n\n*** Features:\n- Create a project with car data\n- After a measurement you must specify the speed\n- The Result is displayed in a chart\n- The chart can be zoomed in and out\n- The chart displays a reference line when tapped to better identify the frequency\n- The chart displays potential sources of vibrations (wheels or cardan shaft)\n- Data can be exported:\n\t- A single measurement including the chart can be exported as pdf\n\t- The original data of a project can be exported and imported\n\t- With iTunes File Sharing or the Files app: all files can be accessed [date].fft\n- A simple analysis for vehicles is integrated\n- The analysis can be adapted to your needs with basis technical understanding. Use iTunes File Sharing to download a configuration file (It is named analysis-gui.json and should be self-explanatory).\n\nThe accuracy depends on the accuracy of the build-in hardware. For a verifiable measurement result, please use a professional measuring device.\n\nThe evaluation of the results must be done by a human. Vibrations are normla (i.e. for a car) and still exists if the car is working correctly."

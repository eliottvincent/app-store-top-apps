For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

      "label": "Shift Worker is designed for people who need a quick and easy way to enter and view their shifts.\n\nA traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

Simply select the type of gas, enter a value, select the units, press the 'Calculate' button and the calculator will show all gas rates (cubic metres per hour, cubic feet per hour and litres per second) and heat inputs (MJ/h, kW and BTUs per hour) based on the CV.\n\nThe Tightness Testing function allows you to quickly select between the let-by and tightness tests and has an easy to use timer. No longer do you need to fiddle about with your phone's timer!\n\nCalorific values can be entered manually (and saved) for more accurate gas rate calculation results. The calorific value of natural gas in the UK varies from about 38.3 to 40.5 MJ per cubic metre; this can mean a difference in the gas rate calculation of more than 5%! With this calculator you can add the CV for your area in the settings page and avoid these inaccuracies. The default values set for butane and propane are both the same as supplied by Calor and BOC.\n\nThe metric timer can be set to either 1 or 2 minutes. For U6 and G4 meters one minute is sufficient, for E6 meters two minutes is recommended for accuracy. The timer can be set to an audible alert, vibrate, both or neither.\n\nA torch function is included with this app if your device has an LED flash."

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

      "label": "This application is for those who like to be aware of the celestial movements of the planets (from an astrological point of view) and use them in their everyday life. \n\nIt displays the following information: \n• the sign in which one planet is at the certain moment; \n• its position (degree) in that sign; \n• the date and time of entering into the next sign (or previous if the planet is retrograde) - or, in other words, the planet's \"ingress\"; \n• the planet's direction of movement (if it is retrograde, a \"R\" will be displayed next to the degree and it will be colored in red). \n\nFeatures in this Pro version: \n=============================\n1) Ephemeris from year 1920 to 2050 \n2) Unlimited Undo \n3) Go to Next Sign change of a planet (next ingress) - you will be able to see when a planet changes signs. \n4) Go to Next Direction (Retrogradation) change for a planet - you will be able to see when a planet starts or ends retrogradation. \n5) Go to Next Custom Degree for a planet - very useful to check transit moments or planet returns.\n6) full Retina graphics\n7) Dark Mode (for iOS 13)\n8) Save as Calendar Event - for any displayed moment\n\nThese new features transforms our application in a full ephemeris front end, with a lot of very handy advanced tools, never seen in any other application from App Store, regardless of the price! And in the same time it will be the same easy to use app even for a beginner. \n\nTIPS \nSwipe the table with one finger to go to the next/previous day. \nSwipe with two fingers to go an entire week forward or backward. \nTap on a planet row to access all actions. \n\nDISCLAIMER \nThe calculated data has a reasonable precision.

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "3 Wins app is a simple, yet effective achievements tracker, that helps bring out your positive thoughts and form a good habit of appreciating your accomplishments during the day. \n\nCelebrate your daily achievements with 3 Wins. During the day whenever you achieve your goal or something positive enter it right away into the 3 Wins app. You can also pause at the end of your busy day to summarize and record your wins/achievements. By doing this, your brain will shift more towards positive thinking. \n\nTrack your achievements or personal goals, every day. Stretch your brain and take the good thoughts out before going to sleep and forgetting about them.\n\n\n=== WHAT IS A WIN? === \nA win can be anything positive you think of that was completed during the day. It can be something personal for example no junk food ate, or you made the bed in the morning. Treat all accomplished tasks in the day as a win and celebrate by checking them off. You can also track your business goals and achievements for the day, for example you met or exceeded your daily sales quota or finished that project you were working on for weeks! \n\nAppreciate your daily wins more!\n\n\n=== SAMPLE WINS ===\n• No junk food\n• Drank 8 glasses of water\n• Completed stretching\n• Breathe\n• Finished workout\n• Marketing project completed\n• First 5K run\n• Had a healthy snack\n\n\n=== HOW IT WORKS? === \nEach day has a goal to write down at least 3 wins to close the day on green. You can add random completed goals or create a repeating task that you will check off every day. Why 3? We want to stretch your brain and think more on the positive side. There had to be at least 3 things you have completed today?! Did you drink enough water, took a bike to work, parked further to walk more, said thank you, smiled. Any positive task completed is a win! And don’t be tied just to 3, if it was 1 or 10 write them all down!\n\n\n=== KEY FEATURES ===\n• Super simple achievement tracking.\n• Calendar view will show you a glance color coded view of your month. Dark green colors mean you have achieved 3 or more wins, lighter colors not quite there, but it is better than none!\n• Daily general reminder to get things noted.\n• Set reminders for your scheduled wins to get reminded to complete them.\n• Create wins/tasks that are repeating/recurring.\n• Supports Siri Shortcuts.\n• Apple Watch app.\n• iCloud sync\n• Confetti celebration for a full day of wins!"

Its advanced simulation engine can handle both analog and digital circuits and features realtime always-on analysis. It is the perfect companion to students, hobbyists, and engineers.\n\nYou use it as you would any CAD program: you add elements, connect them together, and set their properties.\n\nBut iCircuit is unlike other CAD programs because it is always simulating. It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!\n\nThere are over 70 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from a programmable Arduino, to simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETS, to digital gates.\n\nThe app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals. The scope can also display the Fourier transform of any signal so that you can see the performance of filters.\n\nSupported elements include:\n\n• Programmable Arduino using a subset of the C programming language\n• Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources\n• Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors\n• Manual SPST/SPDT and DPST/DPDT Switches, Push buttons, and Relays\n• LEDs, Diodes, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs\n• Audio simulation with Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs\n• ADCs, and DACs\n• Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR\n• JK and D Flip-flops\n• 38 7400 series digital parts \n• 78xx and LM317 voltage regulators\n• 7-segment display and driver\n• Antenna with simulated AM and FM signals\n\nYou can also create sub circuits to introduce new elements and componentize your designs.\n\nNo matter your skill set, you'll be playing with circuits in no time with iCircuit."

This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "BlockyTime, A simple time logger no need to tap Start/Stop.\n\n### App Store Featured of 2016 in China & HongKong ###\n### Top 10 Productivity apps in China ###\n\nEverybody has his own demand on tracking time, but most people can't persist on it for long time because the traditional time-tracking App is way too professional, and it costs too much energy to use a stopwatch.\n\nBlockyTime is very different from traditional time-tracking App, it never needs to tap \"Start/Stop\". Months of research of users experience made us to work out a better tracking method which is more suitable for people's thinking. No worries to forget to start or stop stopwatch, just take a few seconds in leisure time, like playing game, select, tap, a whole day is tracked.\n\nWhen tracking time no longer has pressure but becomes relaxing, it solves the persistence problem easily. Even people don't has huge perseverance can be good at time management.\n\n[Features]\n• Super easy and rapid method to track time spending on every event\n• Custom classification of event\n    Not only by event type (eg. work, rest), but also by specific details (eg. Game, music), also by priorities (such as four quadrants)\n• Unique link of event and object, analyze event from different angle\n• Comment, record details of event like writing a diary\n• Statistics, analyze time occupation by pie or bar chart\n• Trend, check and compare events time spending in line chart by day or month\n• Goal, such as reach 10000h in 5 years on drawing\n• Backup data to iCloud or computer, never lose it\n• Selected color themes, and colorblind mode is added\n\n[Suitable for]\n• Students\n  Track time spending on subjects, analyze it and make a better study plan\n• Researchers\n  Track time spending on research, analyze and make a more efficient research plan\n• Managers\n  Who have many projects to do and needs to know time spending on every project\n• People with part-time jobs\n  Track time on every work and analyze earnings\n• Salespeople\n  Record time and frequency of contacting clients\n• New moms and dads\n  Get to know baby's regular life and make a plan to rest\n• People haven't know the value of time\n  Keep tracking time for a while, the statistics will shock you\n• People want to analyze time and make him better\n• People want to know what costs time\n• People are not satisfied with current situation, want to learn how to manage time and improve himself \n\n[Q & A]\nQ: Why named \"BlockyTime\"?\nA: Though time is continuous, for rapid tracking, we separate time into blocks by half an hour at the expense of accuracy. This period not only meets the need of statistics, but also is convenient for people to remember event.\n\nQ: Why make 30 minutes a block? This is not accurate.\nA: Statistics is meaningful only when people persist for a long time. Look at statistics in week or month, 30 minutes a blocks hardly make negative effects on analysis. Compared to spending more energy to make it accurate, track time quicker, take advantage of saved time on other things makes it better.\n\nQ: I have OCD, inaccuracy makes me uncomfortable.\nA: Just stand back and think about it, if you pursue the accuracy, after every time of record, should you add an event called \"Tracking time\"? Then it takes some time to track this one, so you have to record again, and then, endless loop…\n\nNever spend much time on tracking time, this is truly using time effectively.\n\n[Users' comments]\n“The most time-saving tool ever”\n“It makes me not to spend time on recording, reveals the essence of tracking. I must rate this truly efficient app”\n“One of my favourite time management/tracking apps!”\n“Very easy to use and intuitive”\n“Easiest time tracking tool I ever used”\n“Milestone app of time tracking” -- zhihu.com\n\nIf you like this app, just take one minute to rate it, we'll appreciate it!\n\n[Contact me]\nGot some ideas in your mind?

You can also check height of your camera from known size object on the bottom surface in Calibration-Mode.\n\nYou can quick estimate distances to objects or height of an object from the bottom surface. Especially useful if you need to estimate big objects where standard tape measure can't be applied (e.g. measure the height of a tree or building) and where the accuracy is not critical. \n\nQuick Guide on startup contains information about app calibration and tips for proper measurements. If height of the camera is unknown you can calibrate with known length (sheet of paper, width of  road, etc) or height (person's height, fence, etc)\n\nAccuracy of the app depends on the way the app is used: Supported-Mode (e.g. using Tripod) , where your device is fixed at known height,  provides much  better accuracy compared to  FreeHand-Mode due to stable device position and proper rotation.\n\nAccuracy estimation is also shown when measurement result is presented.\nMillimeters units are used in the app now."

      "label": "iPinSafe is the perfect solution if you want to take your secret passwords and PIN codes with you on your iPhone or iPod touch. You can enter and maintain the data either with this app, or with the Mac version of iPinSafe (available on the Mac App Store).\n\nThe app stores the information in a very secure way on your iPhone, and only allows access to someone who can reproduce a specific screen gesture, defined by you.\n\nThe program stores the information with strong encryption, using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Therefore, the only way to access the data is by entering a key, which only you know. There is no \"backdoor\" to get to the information!\n\niPinSafe uses a unique approach for entering the key. You do not have to type a password or a secret number; instead the program lets you define a gesture, in the form of a line pattern that you simply draw on the screen. This approach has a number of advantages:\n- It is faster than typing a password.\n- Being a line pattern, the key is easier to remember than a series of letters and digits.\n- The number of possible gestures is huge, so it is virtually impossible to guess the correct one.\n\nThe encryption key is not stored on the device - only you know the personal gesture. So even if you lose the device, the information is safe.\n\nWhile you draw your secret line pattern, it appears in a small area of the screen, and can even be totally hidden if you wish. If you suspect that an unauthorized person saw you drawing the line pattern, you can easily change it.\n\nWhile accessing your confidential data, you can lock the data instantly by simply turning the device face-down. This clears the screen, and you must enter the gesture again to see the data.\n\nThe program also locks the data if the device is tilted or moved quickly - for example if someone unexpectedly grabs it from your hands.\n\niPinSafe keeps track of the number of times a wrong gesture has been entered. The app supports auto-destruct: if a wrong gesture has been entered too many times in a row, the stored data is destroyed. You can configure the maximum number of attempts yourself."

Just tap and the keyboard will launch.\n\n\nAUTO CLEAR\n\nAfter typing out your message and sending to a contact, you can choose to automatically clear the keyboard so you don’t have to clear it yourself.\n\nIf your message gets cleared, you can easily get it back by holding down on the text field.\n\n\nCURSOR\n\nWhilst typing on the Full keyboard, you can see exactly where you are with the pulsing blue cursor.\n\n\nSETTINGS\n\nCustomise Retro Keyboard your way.\n\nAccess the Settings menu by using the options button on the keyboard and you’ll be able to toggle settings like suggestions & haptic feedback.\n\n\nAPP STORE\n\nNo need to install the iPhone app, you can get Retro Keyboard directly from the App Store on your Apple Watch.\n\nTroubleshooting steps are available on iPhone.\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: info@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\n\nPlease note, a supported Apple Watch is required for full app functionality. Currently, sending messages in the Apple Watch app only supports the built-in Apple Messages app using iMessage or SMS."

      "label": "The \"HVAC Pipe Sizer - Gas Low\" application allows you to quickly size a simple low pressure (less than 1.5psi) gas piping system by inputting a number of piping and gas properties.\n\nYou can specify the total gas flow in cuft/hr (CubicM/hr) and one of either pressure drop (in. wg or Pa), pipe internal diameter (inches) or gas velocity (ft/s) parameters. The results include both the exact and nominal pipe diameters and the calculated velocity and total pipe equivalent length. If you are analyzing an existing pipe system, there is an option to input the existing pipe internal diameter and one of either pressure drop or gas velocity parameters to derive the calculated gas flow and other remaining properties.\n\nYou can specify additional parameters such as the type of gas, various properties of the gas, the pipe material type, the total length of pipe, quantities for up to 11 different types of pipe fittings, and much more. You can also choose to display values in either english or metric units.\n\nThis application includes built-in pipe fitting equivalent length and nominal pipe sizing tables for a wide variety of pipe material types and diameters.\n\nThe \"HVAC Pipe Sizer - Gas Low\" application uses slider controls that allow you to quickly increment or decrement the input values and immediately observe the calculated results. You can also manually input exact values.\n\nAll values can be displayed in English (IP) and Metric (SI) units.\n\nThis app now includes the HVAC Equipment Locator.

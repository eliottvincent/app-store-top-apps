For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Roku.\n\n* Supported Roku TVs: Hisense, Sharp, TCL, Insignia, Hitachi, Philips, Element, JVC\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Roku must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Roku or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

There is a lot of swearing. Really so very much swearing. Please do not buy this app and then be shocked by the swearing, because there is a lot of it, and here we are, telling you about it right up front. \n\nIf traditional housekeeping isn’t really your style, but your living space needs a little attention, UfYH’s challenges and customizable features will help you get your place back in shape, a few minutes at a time. Rather than encourage marathon cleaning sessions, UfYH gives you the tools to clean up, a little at a time. Unf&%*ing your habitat turns dreaded chores into easy-to-complete tasks, with a hefty dose of “filthy” language to motivate you to clean up.\n\n    -Clean and simple easy-to-use interface.\n    -Select timed challenges in 5, 10, or 20 minute intervals and try to beat the clock to finish the challenge.\n    -Select challenges by room.\n    -Create a customized to-do list and reminders to keep you on schedule.\n    -Earn achievements for completing challenges or finishing your to-do list.\n    -Use the 20/10 timer to reward yourself with a 10-minute break for every 20 minutes of work. Shorter challenges count cumulatively toward your total time.\n    -Random motivators remind you that excuses are boring and use a combination of a little guilt, a little shame, and a little swearing to get you moving. \n\nUfYH is especially useful for those who don’t have a lot of spare time to devote to cleaning: students, people with full-time jobs, people with roommates, anyone who can’t find the motivation to get up and just do something. Even if it’s just a little something! Our lives are complicated and messy, and we’re often overwhelmed and distracted, and sometimes a little lazy. Unf&%* things and see a remarkable difference in how you tackle cleaning.\n\nUfYH uses frequent profanity and is for mature audiences. In-app, the word \"filth\" is replaced by its older, more foul-mouthed cousin. This app uses the \"f-word.\" A lot. Please be aware of this before purchasing."

      "label": "This is the feature packed Gas Rate Calculator & Guide, from Mr Combi Training!\n\nWe've managed to cram all of this into one app....\n\n• Metric and imperial gas rate calculators\n• Save, email or export your results to other apps such as Dropbox, Google Drive or Evernote\n• Built-in torch\n• Tightness and let-by timer\n• Conversion calculator\n• Full gas rate guide\n• Supports natural gas, butane and propane\n• Save manual calorific values for improved accuracy\n• Select between a 1 and 2 minute timer for metric meters\n• Selectable timer alert\n• Supports ¼ft³, ½ft³ 1ft³, 2ft³ and 5ft³ imperial test dials\n\nA guide has been built into the app with 6 pages:\n• Metric gas rate calculations\n• Imperial gas rate calculations\n• Heat input calculations\n• Let-by test procedure\n• Tightness test procedure\n• Permissible drops on the tightness test\n\nAn extra Converter calculator is included in the app for simple conversions between gas rates and heat inputs. Simply select the type of gas, enter a value, select the units, press the 'Calculate' button and the calculator will show all gas rates (cubic metres per hour, cubic feet per hour and litres per second) and heat inputs (MJ/h, kW and BTUs per hour) based on the CV.\n\nThe Tightness Testing function allows you to quickly select between the let-by and tightness tests and has an easy to use timer. No longer do you need to fiddle about with your phone's timer!\n\nCalorific values can be entered manually (and saved) for more accurate gas rate calculation results. The calorific value of natural gas in the UK varies from about 38.3 to 40.5 MJ per cubic metre; this can mean a difference in the gas rate calculation of more than 5%! With this calculator you can add the CV for your area in the settings page and avoid these inaccuracies. The default values set for butane and propane are both the same as supplied by Calor and BOC.\n\nThe metric timer can be set to either 1 or 2 minutes. For U6 and G4 meters one minute is sufficient, for E6 meters two minutes is recommended for accuracy. The timer can be set to an audible alert, vibrate, both or neither.\n\nA torch function is included with this app if your device has an LED flash."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

      "label": "Introducing Bento. The Do Less To-Do List\n\nBento helps you do less, but more meaningful tasks.\nWe all have plenty of to-dos on our list and our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nBento doesn't replace your to-do list, it complements it!\nOne of the biggest productivity issues is prioritization - so we've limited you to 3 tasks per Bento box.\n\n---\n\nSo, how does Bento work?\n\nTASK LIMITS\n\nBento limits you to 3 tasks per box - to help you do less, but more meaningful to-dos. We limit how many boxes you can open to 7 boxes in total, to help you plan only what is most important. Our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nSMALL, MEDIUM & LARGE TASKS\n\nMuch like a box for sushi, Bento allows you to create small, medium, and large tasks helping you to organize your tasks in sizeable chunks for better completion. The best productivity experts recommend reducing your workload for better per-task performance.\n\n3 ENERGY-BASED WORKFLOWS\n\nOnce you have your 3 priority tasks. We've created 3 workflows, Eat That Frog, Climb The Summit, and the Slow Burn to help you best order your day for success and energy.\n\nSINGLE-TASK FOCUS MODE\n\nTo truly focus, we need fewer distractions. Blocking out attention to focus on just your key task can make a huge difference. Inside Bento, we have a single-task focus mode combined with a countdown timer for deep focus work states.\n\nDARK & LIGHT MODE\n\nEach box can be customized with an emoji alongside stunningly animated themes. Each theme has a light mode and dark mode, for optimal productivity.\n\n6 BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THEMES\n\nRelaxing Japanese-themed backgrounds for a soothing way to handle your most meaningful tasks.\n\n---\n\nBento can be used in a variety of ways, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Create a daily Bento to plan your 3 priority tasks\n- Plan the full week by adding up to 7 Bento boxes\n- Build a week, month, and yearly goals list for planning ahead\n\nThe Bento app is the best and most effective place to implement the Bento Methodology, a new mindful way to approach task management. Bento is now optimised for iPad as part of a single universal app for all your iOS devices.\n\n---\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nReach out on Twitter @BentoMethod or email bento@keepproductive.com for any help.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nFind the full privacy policy here: https://www.bentomethod.com/privacy"

The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher or key size.\n• Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\n• The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\n• Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.\n\nFor more info see http://www.awallet.org/\n\nIf you like this App, rate it in the App Store.

We all have good intentions but we need a bit of encouragement here and there. Doing the laundry is an epic feat of stamina so why not get stamina points for it?!\n\nThe to-do list is fully-featured and supports repeating tasks, displays reminders for overdue events and allows time-critical events to be assigned to specific days, while more aspirational quests can be set to \"someday\" so you don't lose sight of your goals. And each task completed is destroyed by your avatar, so get your Undead Warrior to beat-up your laundry, or your Treeman to headbutt your overspilling inbox.\n\nThe app is supplied with 5 animated avatars which grow in characteristics that represent your own life.

      "label": "Sketch 3D is a tool for designing 3D models from your fingertips.  You could download models from others, and could also share your great designs with other users by saving models in Public space.\n\nNew feature: Use True Depth Camera to capture face model.\n\nNew feature: Support using video as model texture.\nYou could use video clips from Photo Album, or from Internet URL (YouTube URL not supported), and then apply it onto a model as texture map.\n\nNew feature: Capture movie from the 3D scene.  \nNote! If your device could not capture movie, then, could try out a smaller output resolution (by tapping the control pane). However, arbitrary output size may stop capturing prematurely.\n\nNew feature: Design 3D model animation with skeleton structure.  \nYou could design a skeleton structure by placing bones in hierarchical relation.  Attach model to the skeleton, and then moving the bones to define different poses.  Each pose represented as a keyframe in the timeline view.  And animation sequence is produced by playing interpolation between the keyframes.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nFeatures:\n- Import 3D content directly from browser or email, either in .zip, .rar, .7z.\n- Support formats: Collada DAE, OBJ, 3DS, STL(for 3D printing), and others.\n- Import/export to iCloud drive, via iTune File Sharing, or to Public area via Apple CloudKit Service.\n- Supports AirDrop.\n- Support Quad faces.\n- Smooth surfaces using Subdivision.\n- Mirroring editing.\n- 2-fingers vertex movement, 3 or 4-fingers planar shape creation.\n- Versatile multi-touches drag-through-space gestures to support editing and changing viewing angle at the same time.\n- Flexible face strip drawing.\n- Stitching boundary faces. Stitch triangle soap into connected faces. Stitch over edge or vertex to form a larger face.\n- Stitching Triangles to Quads.\n- Loop Cut faces.\n- Bevel edges.\n- Extrude faces or edges.\n- Revolve (Spin).\n- Vertex Smoothing.\n- Vertex Slide along edges.\n- Crease Editing after mesh subdivision.\n- Split mesh from, or Join mesh to the editing one.\n- Support hierarchical mesh node structure.\n- Direct vertex color editing when texture map is not used.\n- Edit texture map UV coordinates, include atlas generation.\n- 3D Text generation.\n- Scene interaction with your created shape.\n- Design Animation with skeleton structure.\n- Capture movie from the 3D scene.\n- Support using video as model texture map."

Having trouble getting stuff done because of procrastination? Do you need more self control?\n\nThis app allows you to temporarily block distracting (or all) websites on Safari browser.

      "label": "Access your local files and folders on supported web sites including: vscode.dev, photopea.com, and more!\n\nFile Picker is a Safari App Extension that implements the File System Access API web standard. This allows any website or web app that uses the standard to access any local files and folders stored on your iOS device. Stay secure with iOS's built in permission system which ensures that only files that you explicitly grant access to can be read or written to by the website.\n\nExample Uses:\n\n* Write code on the go with Microsoft's Visual Studio Code: Just enable the extension for vscode.dev and you can open files and folders directly from the web app.\n* Edit PSDs with photopea.com: With the extension enabled, you no longer have to download a new PSD when you save your work, you can save to the opened file directly from the web app.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* File picker and folder picker on any website that uses the File System Access APIs\n* Support for limiting MIME types and multiple files\n* Opening existing files, creating new files, and writing to opened files\n* Stream APIs (on supported websites): large files can be read in small chunks and at different positions which saves memory and increases performance\n* Legacy FileReader interface is also supported\n\nAttribution:\n\nIcons made by Freepik (freepik.com) from flaticon.com"

      "label": "A study carried out by Worcester Bosch Group's technical support team found that the most common cause of a boiler installation problem was from incorrectly sized gas pipes. When fitting a new boiler, often the existing pipes should be replace for larger ones due to the increased output. Smaller pipes will mean the boiler is running at a lower power and can cause an increase in carbon monoxide levels.\n\nThe Gas Pipe Sizing Calculator is an extremely easy to use app that will help you to select the right size pipes for installations using copper (up to 108mm), steel (up to 300mm) and PE (up to 315mm) pipes of sections up to 250m (820ft) in length. \n\nTo carry out a calculation simply select the gas type, enter the appliance heat input, enter the pipe length, the number of high or low loss fittings (guidance is given in the app), select the type of pipe and then press the 'Calculate' button. \n\nThe results will show the total equivalent length, the minimum pipe diameter (metric) that should be used and the pressure drop for that section of pipe.\n\nFor multiple appliances each section should be calculated in turn and the kW inputs for the appliances in each section added together for each calculation.\n\nThe maximum pressure drop from each appliance to the meter should be no more than 1 mbar for natural gas or 2.5 mbar for butane or propane. Adding all drops together using the minimum pipe diameters may cause this to be exceeded. Where possible, the results will also calculate the drop if the next larger size pipe diameter is selected on a section, this should help to ensure the right sizes are used throughout the whole circuit.\n\nPlease note: This app is designed mainly for the UK so supports metric pipe sizes only."

      "label": "Sectograph is a visual day planner that displays your calendar events on a pie chart in the form of a 12/24 hour clock face. It's a different way of looking at the day\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe visual planner works like an analog clock widget. It automatically receives all the calendar events and overlays them on the 12/24 hour dial. This provides a different, more efficient view of your schedule.\n\nHOW IT LOOKS\n\nIt looks like a projection of your calendar of events onto a 12-hour dial that has hour and minute hands just like a regular watch.\nEvent sectors are displayed in those hour intervals in which they will occur.\nThe interval of idle time between events is displayed between sectors, as well as the time from an hour hand to the start of each event.\nEvents are displayed automatically 12/24 hours ahead of time.\n\nThe calendar and analog clock, combined, give a visual representation of your busyness, allow you to effectively plan and calculate daytime.\n\nUse a widget for better integration.\n\nAREAS OF APPLICATION\n\n• Day scheduling and timing. Conveniently track your daily tasks, meetings, events and at any time know how much time is left to wait until the end of the current event and until the start of the next. Don't be late.\n\n• Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in your workplace and you will be completely under control.\n\n• Class schedule. Observe how much time is left before the end of a tiresome lecture at the university and never be late for laboratory work.\n\n• Schedule of the day. Follow your daily routine and get better, just use the app to keep track of your to-dos and daily tasks. Take rest breaks in time!\n\n• Trip timer and flight duration. Are you losing the passage of time due to endless travel and flights? Control check-in time, boarding time and flight duration. Keep everything under control.\n\n• Make your meal, medication, and exercise schedule clearer. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!\n\n• Convenient countdown to scheduled events in the app and widget. The plan of the day will be executed exactly.\n\n• The app may appeal to fans of Pomodoro and Chronodex timer technologies. Time tracking with him will happen in a new way."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

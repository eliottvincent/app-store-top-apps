For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

Simply select the type of gas, enter a value, select the units, press the 'Calculate' button and the calculator will show all gas rates (cubic metres per hour, cubic feet per hour and litres per second) and heat inputs (MJ/h, kW and BTUs per hour) based on the CV.\n\nThe Tightness Testing function allows you to quickly select between the let-by and tightness tests and has an easy to use timer. No longer do you need to fiddle about with your phone's timer!\n\nCalorific values can be entered manually (and saved) for more accurate gas rate calculation results. The calorific value of natural gas in the UK varies from about 38.3 to 40.5 MJ per cubic metre; this can mean a difference in the gas rate calculation of more than 5%! With this calculator you can add the CV for your area in the settings page and avoid these inaccuracies. The default values set for butane and propane are both the same as supplied by Calor and BOC.\n\nThe metric timer can be set to either 1 or 2 minutes. For U6 and G4 meters one minute is sufficient, for E6 meters two minutes is recommended for accuracy. The timer can be set to an audible alert, vibrate, both or neither.\n\nA torch function is included with this app if your device has an LED flash."

How about not opening Safari? Yes, you can even switch engines in Spotlight with shortcut and redirect to Safari automatically.\n\n◆ URL Scheme: xSearch not only supports website engines, but also supports URL Scheme, for example: search `twapp apple` in Safari (or Spotlight) will redirect to Twitter app (if it's installed) and search `apple` automatically.\n\n◆ Syncing all your engines across your devices via iCloud.\n\n◆ Export and Import engines JSON file, this let you backup your engines or share engines with other users.\n\n◆ Edit engines in JSON.\n\n◆ Use share extension to search any text via xSearch.\n\n!!!

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "First released in June 2010, CopyIt is the original and most feature rich grid drawing app available anywhere! See why so many artists, teachers and students are using CopyIt as an essential tool in their workflows.\n\nNEW USERS - PLEASE NOTE:\nDue to the large number of features in CopyIt, the toolbars are scrollable.  Try scrolling each toolbar to access all of the available buttons.\n\nUsed by artists such as Vincent Van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci, the grid drawing method has been brought to digital life with CopyIt. CopyIt assists you in copying, enlarging or reducing your chosen reference image using the grid drawing method. You do not even need to be artistic.\n\nThe grid drawing method has been used for centuries. It breaks images down into smaller work areas allowing you to focus on the actual lines and shapes within each square, rather than trying to draw the whole picture at once. You can't help but achieve with this method.\n\nUsing CopyIt as your reference object, it saves you from having to print your photos and ruin them by drawing grids over them, but unlike a real photo, it gives you the ability to zoom into the fine details.  With a pencil, you then draw up a grid with the same number of squares using a separate medium, such as paper or canvas. Working square by square, you CopyIt!\n\nIf you want to draw an image larger or smaller than the original, the pencil-drawn grid should be drawn larger or smaller than the original grid on the device with the same amount of squares.  All that matters is that the contents of each square are drawn to scale.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Comprehensive Help\n- Portrait or Landscape orientation\n- Universal App, compatible with iPad, iPhone and iPod touch\n- Fullscreen mode (hides toolbars)\n- Built-in Music player\n- Audible feedback (can be turned off)\n- Extra options in the Settings App\n- Set your Maximum Zoom level from x1 to x20\n- CopyIt can resist entering standby while in use\n- TubeMatch™ for approximating paint and pencil colours\n- Mosaic to average surrounding colours into coloured squares\n- Tonal Strip to help identify values\n- Media types (Imperial and Metric)\n\nGrid Options:\n- 6 Grid Types\n- Preset or custom Columns, Rows and Points grid sizing options\n- To maintain the grid visibility regardless of your photo, choose from 9 grid colors, Black (default), Gray, White, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange and Magenta\n- Grid transparency is adjustable in 5% increments \n- 5 different Grid Line thicknesses\n- Grid letters and numbers (now 8 different formats)\n- A center point in each grid square \n- Guidelines: 1/4 and 1/16 to help you copy your subject\n- Solid or Dashed Guidelines\n- Guideline colour can be set independently to Grid colour\n- SmartMove: Just touch a square once to zoom to that square\n- SmartMove: takes advantage of your maximum zoom setting, never zooming in more than that amount\n- Target mode highlights the current square and dims the rest, helping you to focus your attention\n\nFilters and Effects:\n- 12 Primary Filters\n- 6 Secondary Filters\n- Onion Skin Feature: Overlay your reference image above your work to quickly assess your accuracy\n- 12 different image aspects \n- Rotate the image in 90 degree increments\n- Vertical and Horizontal Flip image\n\nImport Options:\n- Cameras are supported - both front and back\n- Load Project\n- Load From Photo Album\n\nExport Options:\n- Save Project\n- Export Photo (AirDrop, email, message, print, export to Facebook, Twitter etc)\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to use CopyIt, a user guide is available within the App and on the Support website.\n\nYou can contact the developer on Facebook or Twitter.\nwww.facebook.com/CopyItTheGridDrawingMethod or @copyitforios\n\nThank you to all our users for their feedback and feature suggestions which have helped make CopyIt what it is today."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Roku.\n\n* Supported Roku TVs: Hisense, Sharp, TCL, Insignia, Hitachi, Philips, Element, JVC\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Roku must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

The Do Less To-Do List\n\nBento helps you do less, but more meaningful tasks.\nWe all have plenty of to-dos on our list and our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nBento doesn't replace your to-do list, it complements it!\nOne of the biggest productivity issues is prioritization - so we've limited you to 3 tasks per Bento box.\n\n---\n\nSo, how does Bento work?\n\nTASK LIMITS\n\nBento limits you to 3 tasks per box - to help you do less, but more meaningful to-dos. We limit how many boxes you can open to 7 boxes in total, to help you plan only what is most important. Our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nSMALL, MEDIUM & LARGE TASKS\n\nMuch like a box for sushi, Bento allows you to create small, medium, and large tasks helping you to organize your tasks in sizeable chunks for better completion. The best productivity experts recommend reducing your workload for better per-task performance.\n\n3 ENERGY-BASED WORKFLOWS\n\nOnce you have your 3 priority tasks. We've created 3 workflows, Eat That Frog, Climb The Summit, and the Slow Burn to help you best order your day for success and energy.\n\nSINGLE-TASK FOCUS MODE\n\nTo truly focus, we need fewer distractions. Blocking out attention to focus on just your key task can make a huge difference. Inside Bento, we have a single-task focus mode combined with a countdown timer for deep focus work states.\n\nDARK & LIGHT MODE\n\nEach box can be customized with an emoji alongside stunningly animated themes. Each theme has a light mode and dark mode, for optimal productivity.\n\n6 BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THEMES\n\nRelaxing Japanese-themed backgrounds for a soothing way to handle your most meaningful tasks.\n\n---\n\nBento can be used in a variety of ways, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Create a daily Bento to plan your 3 priority tasks\n- Plan the full week by adding up to 7 Bento boxes\n- Build a week, month, and yearly goals list for planning ahead\n\nThe Bento app is the best and most effective place to implement the Bento Methodology, a new mindful way to approach task management. Bento is now optimised for iPad as part of a single universal app for all your iOS devices.\n\n---\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nReach out on Twitter @BentoMethod or email bento@keepproductive.com for any help.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nFind the full privacy policy here: https://www.bentomethod.com/privacy"

Over time you’ll also start seeing suggested hour blocks based on your previous activity, making the experience even more effortless. You don’t have to abandon using the Calendar app either, as Hour Blocks automatically pulls in events from your calendar.\n\nA SATISFYING EXPERIENCE\nEvery part of the Hour Blocks experience has been developed to make it as satisfying as possible for you to use. From the playful language to the laid back colour scheme, organising your day doesn’t feel like a chore.\n\nGET IN TOUCH\nIf you have any questions or feedback, please get in touch.

Created by actors for actors, Scene Study frees you from the script to start actively listening and responding in the scene. By recording your cues lines, you practice listening for them right along with recalling your own. \n\nOnce you have a scene set up, save time by rehearsing while doing other activities. Combining other tasks with rehearsal enables deeper memorization of your lines and often provides a few unexpected insights to your character. \n\nGetting started is easy. Simply create a production, add characters, then start recording your character's spoken and cue lines. Record the full lines for your scene partners or just the cue lines. Then start rehearsing!\n\nChoose the character you wish to rehearse by muting them during playback and enjoy your own portable scene partner. Rehearse around the house or on the go, rehearse while driving or doing chores. It’s that easy! \n\nFeatures \n\n- Dress rehearsal mode!\n- Line prompting to speed memorization.\n- Streamlined recording interface.\n- Lock screen audio controls integration.\n- Great for single scene and full length productions.\n- Shared character lists for productions.\n- Streamlined scene screen enables playback and recording from one screen. \n- Playback all scene lines or mute a character to rehearse lines from memory.\n- Drag and drop line reordering.\n- Auto-save recordings for fast scene creation.\n- Headphone and bluetooth support for limitless rehearsal opportunities."

      "label": "◉  Touch on this description text for details of the 4 modes of use, and if this app is something you can use●●\n\n● All Auction Sniping is fee FREE FOR LIFE. no more paying a service for each auction. \n\n● Adjust bid time between 10 seconds and 2 seconds before end of auction,  Enter your Maximum price you would pay,  and the snipe automatically bids only what is needed to win,  using only your Maximum price if that is what is needed to win.\n\n● This App has 4 modes, a Mac companion app is used for mode (1)  (see each below)\ncombine modes for exactly what you want in an eBay sniper.\n\n◉  ◦ ●●●  First mode  ●●● ◦ ◉\nDo you own a Macintosh computer(OSX 10.8 or better)?  if yes, use this mode,  if not, continue to the other modes below.\n\nwhy a companion Mac app?  because as you may already know,  apps like this do not run tasks in the background.  In contrast, The Mac app CAN run in the background, and it can finish the snipe for you in the background automatically, a complete automatic sniper in this mode.\n\nTo have the app snipe for you automatically, you will need three things\n  ◎  1) this app.\n  ◎  2) iCloud turned on.\n  ◎  3) the companion Mac app available in the Mac App Store.  See the help-Faqs tab in the app or at website, touch on the \"Developer Website\" link below, (also very low price) \n\nThen just follow the steps 1,2,3,4 at the bottom of the window in the app.\n\n(the Mac App also has all the functionality of this App.  All the snipes are shared through iCloud between the two companion apps near instantaneously.)\n\n◉  ◦ ●●  Second mode  ●● ◦ ◉\nDo you have an old iPod touch or iPad/iPhone (iOS8 or better),  or can buy a used iDevice?  Then you can set up that device as your new dedicated Sniper-server and do completely automatic sniping that way.\n\n○ Want to do automatic sniping without leaving your main device on?   Just pick up an old iPod or other iDevice,  install this sniper app on it at no additional cost,  go to the ‘System Settings’ on the device, and then the tab ‘General’ and set ‘Auto Lock’ to Never, and the iCloud account to the same as the rest of your iDevices. Now plug the device in permanently so the device is always on with the Sniper App running in the foreground. This device now becomes your ‘Sniper Server’. Add snipes with your main Device, let your new Sniper-server do the rest.\n\n◉  ◦ ●●  Third mode  ●● ◦ ◉\nAs you may already know,  apps like this do not run tasks in the background.  In that case,  this app can set alerts that remind you to get the app into the foreground so it can do that snipe for you while in the foreground.  The alerts are set automatically.  \n\nFollow the steps 1,2,3,4 at the bottom of the window in the app to set your snipe. In this mode, two alerts are automatically set, 1) at about one hour before the end of the auction to remind you of the coming auction.\nthen 2) at about two mins to go.  At this alert, open the sniper app and it will finish the snipe for you.\nIf you want additional alerts besides the ones automatically set, then enter mode (4) to set up additional alerts (see below).\n\n◉  ◦ ●●  Fourth mode  ●● ◦ ◉\n● Some people want to see what is going on near the end of the auction and want to enter that bid personally at the last moment.  In this mode, you can set up to 3 alerts at a time so you can get in that chair and do just that. With one touch have all alerts entered into your calendar with correct time and with peace of mind, no mistakes.\n\n● With iCloud, your new Calendar events will also sync to all your other devices and Calendars for seamless alerts automatically so your entire digital arsenal is alerted.\n\n● A link back to the listing is saved with your alerts, so when an alert appears, simply touch on \"view\" and you'll see a link to the listing for immediate action. \n◦ ◦ ◦\n\n● You will be pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to set up a snipe in any of the modes."

      "label": "Notebooks is a writing app, a text and markdown editor, your personal Wiki and Zettelkasten, a file organizer, task manager, PDF and eBook creator and more. This may sound like a lot, but consider you have a few text fragments, randomly created, which you want to combine into a chapter of a book and saved as PDF or eBook; or a quick note sparks off an idea, generates a couple of tasks, each of which requires you to organize further research material; or you have business related documents which need to be separated from private diaries, records and files. – With Notebooks you handle these jobs easily without switching apps, and while remaining focussed and creative.\n\n• Notebooks stores all your documents as regular files in standard formats. You are always in control of your documents, never need to worry about how to export them, and they remain compatible across devices and over time.\n\n• Create formatted documents with styles, attachments, tables or checklists, and add a table of contents if you like. Choose between a variation of ready made document styles, or create your own, if you want.\n\n• Write your documents in plain text and allow Notebooks to automatically handle lists, highlight and center the current line on screen, automatically insert closing characters for  (, {, [, \" and more. - Plain text is a universal format which can be used on any device without any specific software.\n\n• Use Markdown to create formatted documents from plain text. Notebooks supports *MultiMarkdown* and its own flavor of *Discount*.  – Click any word in a formatted Markdown text and start writing at that position. You can even create checklists (- [ ]) and tick them off in formatted view. Syntax highlighting and a set of dedicated extra keyboard keys make Markdown editing easy.\n  \n• Use your Apple Pencil to sketch ideas or annotate images and PDF documents.\n\n• Use Notebooks' advanced editing capabilities to work on documents which are stored in other apps.\n\n• Compile selected documents or the contents of whole books into a single document, an eBook or a PDF document.\n\n• Link between documents in Notebooks. In Markdown you can even use Wiki style links ([[ ]]). When clicking a link to a document which does not yet exist, Notebooks suggests to create it. And when you move or rename documents, Notebooks makes sure the links remain intact.\n\n• Create as many books as you need to structure your projects and details. Nest books as deep as you like, there is no limit in Notebooks. If you ever loose track, Notebooks' full text search helps you quickly turn up even the most hidden document.\n\n• Turn books into task lists to display document as tasks which can be ticked off. Assign due dates and alerts, and divide projects into nested sub projects, which makes them easier to handle. \n\n• For simple lists you can use checklists in formatted documents and Markdown.\n\n• Assign Context tags to books and documents to create shortcuts that are accessible for a smart book at Notebooks' top level. – Notebooks can even extract context tags from the contents of documents as you create them.\n\n• Import all documents and files you want to keep close at hand, no matter whether PDF, email, web pages, MS Office or iWorks, photos, videos, music and more.\n\n• Scan documents and extract text using OCR (iOS 13)\n\n• Sync files between iPads, iPhones, Mac or PC. \n\nWith all that, Notebooks may quickly become your one and only app for everything you want to keep close at hand.\n\nUser Comments: \n\n“Notebooks is a wonderful App, which is so much better than the dozen other note apps I tried. It is sophisticated, in an unassuming way, so that you find yourself greatly rewarded and being productive without sacrificing time/effort to the App. I cannot tell you how much productivity I have gained.  I am having a huge amount of fun, I use it constantly, more than the phone on my iPhone in fact.\" \n\n“You are GTD in every way that makes it efficient and makes me efficient.”"

When you have finished your gags and you are leaving the room you can choose a crowd applause sound for your exit. \nEach time you press the button will choose randomly from a selection of that style. There are between 5 and 10 of each style. They will never play the same one twice in a row either making it sound more natural\n\nPerhaps you are a wannabe stand-up comedian that needs some helpful laughs or perhaps you need some moral support for your terrible dad jokes.\nWell use this app to give the illusion you are the funniest comedian alive! if not a little original.\n\nAll sounds are original and recorded from genuine live stand-up gigs."

A preconfigured task list ensures that during the organization of the event nothing will be overlooked, and moreover can be manually tailored to your personal requirements in creating the event. Via push notification you will be conveniently reminded of tasks yet outstanding. That facilitates planning your event and ensures that no details will be forgotten. \n\nDesign and processing of the guest list becomes child’s play with our app. Not only can the number of guests be constantly updated as needed, but using the three-color coded structure you can also determine categories for the visitors to your party (such as family, friends, etc). \n\nAn integrated expense calculator allows you to maintain views of total cost, already fully and partially paid amounts as well as amounts still payable. Of course you can customize the expense planner by expanding or reducing the number of its categories. \n\nYour party planner will also take care of computing the expected quantities of drinks needed based on your personal drink selection. You’ll simply input the anticipated duration of the event, the drinking behavior of the party guests, and the kinds of drinks you would like to serve and in what proportions. The number of guests will be automatically retrieved from the guest list. \n\nThe party planner makes it easy to organize your personal and all-round perfect party. It’s equally suitable for planning birthdays, family parties, company events, jubilees, grill parties and get-togethers among friends. \n\nDo post the status of your party preparations on Facebook and Twitter. That way your guests can always keep up-to-date with the current state of affairs. \n\n\nOverview of features: \n• Party countdown \n• Universalapp\n• Individual expense planner \n• Predefined flexible expense listing \n• Overview of due tasks \n• Custom task list, according to the type of the party\n• Details for each task \n• Push notifications for open tasks \n• Links to Facebook and Twitter \n• Flexible guest list \n• Available guest categories \n• Individual drinks calculator, adapted to the drinking habits of your guests\n• Guest Categories"

      "label": "Integration between iOS devices and Arduino has never been so easy. No registration, no cloud. Everything under your control. \n\nSupported Boards: UNO, Nano, MEGA2560, ESP32, ESP8622, Zero, MKR1000, Nano 33 IoT, Teensy e nRF52 BLE, Raspberry Pico Pi W. ESP32, Raspberry Pico and Pico W with Micropython.\n\nArduino Manager is an app to control the Arduino board and receive information from it through:\n\n- Ethernet Shield (arduino.cc)\n- HM-10 / HM19\n- Adafruit \n * WINC1500 WiFi\n * CC3000 WiFi \n * nRF52 BLE\n * nRF8001 Bluefruit LE \n * LE SPI Friend\n\nThe app shows a grid and tapping on it you can insert specialized widgets to send and receive information from Arduino. For a better visualization or control, each widget can be zoomed by the means of a double tap on it; \ntap on Configure for configuring the widget itself.\n\nSome widgets are: \n\n- Display Widget: shows values coming from your Arduino (i.e. Temperature). It can show numbers with 0,1,2,3 decimal digits or rolling text\n- LED Widget: shows a LED that can be turned on and off through digital values from Arduino\n- Switch Widget: sets a digital value to Arduino\n- Switch & LED Widget: a combination of the two previous widgets to save space when they are used together with the same variable\n- Push Button Widget: temporarily sets a digital value to Arduino\n- Knob Widget: sets a non-digital value to Arduino\n- SD Widget: shows the list of files in the root of SD Card and selecting a file it shows the content\n- Graph Widget: graphs values in (almost) real time coming from your Arduino (e.g. instantaneous temperature)\n- Logged Data Graph Widget: graphs up to 5 values logged onto the SD Card attached to Arduino. Libraries have helping functions to log data onto the SD Card\n- Alarm Widget: configures an alarm on the Arduino board which is then fired at the desired time. The alarm is fired even if the iOS device is not connected and retained across power off - power on cycles\n- Command Widget: allows to send a command (text message) to Arduino once the yellow button is tapped. You can add more Command Widgets to send different commands\n- Rover Controller Widget: allows driving a rover robot just rotating the device\n- Sound Alarm Widget: sounds an alarm each time the associated condition is verified\n- Threshold Widget: allows setting a threshold to the Arduino board (e.g. the room temperature under which the board has to start an heater)\n- Console Widget: helps the user to debug the Arduino code, receiving and displaying debugging messages\n\nOther widgets are available, please see support site.\n\nEach widget is associated with a name and a variable (i.e. name: Temperature, variable: T). The variable is either written or read by the sketch running on the board allowing the iOS app receiving information from Arduino or controlling it. \nThe app can be easily connected to more boards, each page of widgets can connects to a different board at the same time.\nUser can easily manage different lists of widgets and switch among them in order to control different projects. \nAny widget list can be shared between own devices via iCloud and/or other users via an email message.\n\nMany Arduino libraries are available to easily integrate your own projects with Arduino Manager.  Libraries, related documentation, demo sketches and a video tutorial are available \nfor free from my site. \n\nAvailable In-App purchases:\n\n- Code Generator: allows to generate the communication infrastructure between the Arduino board and iOS device and the code for each chosen widget in order to simplify the programming effort \non Arduino board.\n- PIN Code Generator: allows the user to associate a pin to each Widget and generate the code to manage that pin. In most cases this avoid writing any code\n- Voice Commands: You can now control most of the AM features by mean of voice commands (in English only). It also unlocks Voice Commands Widget\n\nContinuous use of background location can decrease battery life."

GPS needs satellite’s visibility. Thus, the more open your space, the better the accuracy of measurements.\n\n* Geographic coordinates collection formats:\n    . Points - Mark specific places with a point, such as the place you most like to go to, or the starting point of a race, or even the point where you saw a rare bird;\n    . Lines or paths - A sequence of points forming a line to mark a trail where you have walked, or the path you have taken on a run, or the path to your new house, either the location of a new fence you want to build. All mapped lines are measured for you in metric and imperial units;\n    . Areas or polygons - A sequence of points, forming a closed region, to mark land that you are interested in buying, or show the map of your land, or measure the outline of your new house, or delimit the region where you want to build a pool. All mapped areas are calculated for you in metric, imperial and Thai units;\n\n* How to collect coordinates:\n    . Manually: You position yourself and tap the MapIt button to collect a coordinate;\n    . Automatically by Time: A coordinate is collected at each defined time interval;\n    . Automatically by Distance: A coordinate is collected at each interval of a pre-defined distance;\n    . Automatically by Direction: A coordinate is collected each time you change the direction of your displacement at an angle greater than a defined limit;\n\n* Presentation within iMapIt:\nPoints, lines and polygons can be represented by different types of pins, colors, strokes and fills.\n\n* Export your surveys:\n    . In these formats: DXF, KML, GPX or CSV;\n    . Using these projections: UTM or Gauss Krüger, or directly the collected geographical coordinates;\n    . Sending via: eMail, or directly from your device via iTunes (cable), or even more professionally, transferring to a Web server previously prepared to receive them;\n\n* Editing functions of surveys performed:\n    . Feature duplication;\n    . Union of existing features;\n    . Division of a feature in two;\n    . Deletion of unwanted coordinates;\n    . Automatic cleaning of unnecessary points;\n    . Move a feature to a new project;\n\nDisclaimer on the accuracy of the surveys:\nAll points, paths or areas are surveyed using the GPS accuracy of your device.

Each board end as well as the intersection of boards in the middle are displayed with the angles for each, based on data input. In addition, the length of the board required to fit the desired space (pre-cuts) is given. \n\n\r\n\r\nA visual representative image of the cross braces displays upon calculation showing exact miter angles and position of angles. Miter Angle takes the guesswork out of miter cuts allowing you to achieve that perfect fit with cross or x end braces."

So whenever you forget some task Todo list can remind you. Every time you open ToDo List you became more productive and efficient. \nAs higher the number of your completed task is higher your confidence. \n\nSuccess is all about the shape of your psychology and thoughts. The better the shape, Higher you go. Keep yourself organised, have balanced personal and professional life, Be productive, Be efficient, Success is yours.\n\nDid you notice we didn't add any button to add or save the task? \nYes, We didn't add those buttons. User Experience\n is a game of Psychology and How human mind thinks?.\nYou start typing Hola! a task is created. \nYou are done with typing! Task has been saved. \nOne more backspace on empty task! Task has been deleted. \n\nThe choice of Colours for overall background changes from person to person. So here we are. You can change the colour as per your choice.\n\nBut there shouldn't be any behavioural change in the properties of main objects (here- The Task). So, Every time you finish a task it's colour changes into greyish white and you will feel better and stronger from inside.\n\nWell Organised + Productive + Efficient + Confident = Success\n\nThis app has the least response time. Smallest in Size. Fewer steps to add Task or event than any other app on App Store."

      "label": "A study carried out by Worcester Bosch Group's technical support team found that the most common cause of a boiler installation problem was from incorrectly sized gas pipes. When fitting a new boiler, often the existing pipes should be replace for larger ones due to the increased output. Smaller pipes will mean the boiler is running at a lower power and can cause an increase in carbon monoxide levels.\n\nThe Gas Pipe Sizing Calculator is an extremely easy to use app that will help you to select the right size pipes for installations using copper (up to 108mm), steel (up to 300mm) and PE (up to 315mm) pipes of sections up to 250m (820ft) in length. \n\nTo carry out a calculation simply select the gas type, enter the appliance heat input, enter the pipe length, the number of high or low loss fittings (guidance is given in the app), select the type of pipe and then press the 'Calculate' button. \n\nThe results will show the total equivalent length, the minimum pipe diameter (metric) that should be used and the pressure drop for that section of pipe.\n\nFor multiple appliances each section should be calculated in turn and the kW inputs for the appliances in each section added together for each calculation.\n\nThe maximum pressure drop from each appliance to the meter should be no more than 1 mbar for natural gas or 2.5 mbar for butane or propane. Adding all drops together using the minimum pipe diameters may cause this to be exceeded. Where possible, the results will also calculate the drop if the next larger size pipe diameter is selected on a section, this should help to ensure the right sizes are used throughout the whole circuit.\n\nPlease note: This app is designed mainly for the UK so supports metric pipe sizes only."

      "label": "Habeets is a simple habit-tracking app designed to help you achieve your goals and create a better version of yourself. If you want to create better habits (workout, eat healthily, save more money, etc), or ditch your bad ones (drinking, smoking, etc), Habeets can help you achieve that. You will still need to do the hard work, though...\n\nCORE VALUES\n- Form or ditch any type of habit\n- Easy to use\n- Packed with all the features you need\n- All your habits are for your eyes only.

No subscriptions, no additional payments, or ads.\nPay once, and use forever. That's it.\nHelping you become better and better by using this app is what matters to me.\n\nYOUR PRIVACY MATTERS\nHabeets is focused on privacy. We don't track you or your habits. We don't send any data to 3rd parties. Your habits data never leaves your phone or its iCloud backups. None of your habits data is saved to a server (except iCloud's servers).\n\nREMINDERS\nGo mind-free all day setting reminders for your habits. Set up an alarm for when you need to do something important like drink water or meditate. You'll never miss a chance to keep moving forward.\n\nANYTIME. ANYWHERE\nI designed Habeets so you can use it anytime, anywhere. From your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch. This will help you continue your habits wherever you go.\nFor example, you can use your Apple Watch to track habits when your iPhone is not around.\nAll your data is encrypted and automatically synched throught all your devices.\n\n\n\"Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\" - James Clear (Atomic Habits)\n\nThank you for reading until here. I wish you nothing but the best in your journey.\n\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy: https://habeets.com/privacy-policy/"

It's a different way of looking at the day\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe visual planner works like an analog clock widget. It automatically receives all the calendar events and overlays them on the 12/24 hour dial. This provides a different, more efficient view of your schedule.\n\nHOW IT LOOKS\n\nIt looks like a projection of your calendar of events onto a 12-hour dial that has hour and minute hands just like a regular watch.\nEvent sectors are displayed in those hour intervals in which they will occur.\nThe interval of idle time between events is displayed between sectors, as well as the time from an hour hand to the start of each event.\nEvents are displayed automatically 12/24 hours ahead of time.\n\nThe calendar and analog clock, combined, give a visual representation of your busyness, allow you to effectively plan and calculate daytime.\n\nUse a widget for better integration.\n\nAREAS OF APPLICATION\n\n• Day scheduling and timing. Conveniently track your daily tasks, meetings, events and at any time know how much time is left to wait until the end of the current event and until the start of the next. Don't be late.\n\n• Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in your workplace and you will be completely under control.\n\n• Class schedule. Observe how much time is left before the end of a tiresome lecture at the university and never be late for laboratory work.\n\n• Schedule of the day. Follow your daily routine and get better, just use the app to keep track of your to-dos and daily tasks. Take rest breaks in time!\n\n• Trip timer and flight duration. Are you losing the passage of time due to endless travel and flights? Control check-in time, boarding time and flight duration. Keep everything under control.\n\n• Make your meal, medication, and exercise schedule clearer. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!\n\n• Convenient countdown to scheduled events in the app and widget. The plan of the day will be executed exactly.\n\n• The app may appeal to fans of Pomodoro and Chronodex timer technologies. Time tracking with him will happen in a new way."

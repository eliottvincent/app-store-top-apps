Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

The Do Less To-Do List\n\nBento helps you do less, but more meaningful tasks.\nWe all have plenty of to-dos on our list and our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nBento doesn't replace your to-do list, it complements it!\nOne of the biggest productivity issues is prioritization - so we've limited you to 3 tasks per Bento box.\n\n---\n\nSo, how does Bento work?\n\nTASK LIMITS\n\nBento limits you to 3 tasks per box - to help you do less, but more meaningful to-dos. We limit how many boxes you can open to 7 boxes in total, to help you plan only what is most important. Our mission is to reduce task overwhelm to maximize achievement.\n\nSMALL, MEDIUM & LARGE TASKS\n\nMuch like a box for sushi, Bento allows you to create small, medium, and large tasks helping you to organize your tasks in sizeable chunks for better completion. The best productivity experts recommend reducing your workload for better per-task performance.\n\n3 ENERGY-BASED WORKFLOWS\n\nOnce you have your 3 priority tasks. We've created 3 workflows, Eat That Frog, Climb The Summit, and the Slow Burn to help you best order your day for success and energy.\n\nSINGLE-TASK FOCUS MODE\n\nTo truly focus, we need fewer distractions. Blocking out attention to focus on just your key task can make a huge difference. Inside Bento, we have a single-task focus mode combined with a countdown timer for deep focus work states.\n\nDARK & LIGHT MODE\n\nEach box can be customized with an emoji alongside stunningly animated themes. Each theme has a light mode and dark mode, for optimal productivity.\n\n6 BEAUTIFULLY ANIMATED THEMES\n\nRelaxing Japanese-themed backgrounds for a soothing way to handle your most meaningful tasks.\n\n---\n\nBento can be used in a variety of ways, here are a few recommendations:\n\n- Create a daily Bento to plan your 3 priority tasks\n- Plan the full week by adding up to 7 Bento boxes\n- Build a week, month, and yearly goals list for planning ahead\n\nThe Bento app is the best and most effective place to implement the Bento Methodology, a new mindful way to approach task management. Bento is now optimised for iPad as part of a single universal app for all your iOS devices.\n\n---\n\nQUESTIONS\n\nReach out on Twitter @BentoMethod or email bento@keepproductive.com for any help.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nFind the full privacy policy here: https://www.bentomethod.com/privacy"

      "label": "FDB is a general purpose relational database application for mobile devices. The design goal of the application is to make a database convenient for collecting data in the field. The main distinguishing feature is ability to attach sound recording or photo to any data field regardless of its type. This allows to reduce data collection activity to a few short actions.\n\nThe actual data entry can be performed later, when the user can spend more time entering data into data fields in a searchable form based on media captured in the field. The data can be entered into individual records, or simultaneously into some of the fields of all selected records.\n\nThe application displays database records in customizable table and form views that share persistent settings for filtering and sorting. The display settings can be selected quickly by the name allowing easy changing of data view perspective. Aggregated computations such as total or average values of fields in selected records can be shown in report views.\n\nThe database structure can be altered at any time by adding or removing fields and relations. In addition to static field types the application provides derived fields computed from data values in static fields. Derived fields can be used for filtering, sorting and reporting just like static fields.\n\nThe tables, forms and reports can be printed via Apple AirPrint.\n\nThe application allows importing and exporting data in various file formats. Native FDB file format can contain data from multiple databases and includes complete definition of fields, relations, derived fields and data views. This format is used for creating backup copies of databases, and for transferring data between different devices. When exporting separate database the application automatically includes also related databases, with an option to include complete copy or only records that are linked by relation. On creating FDB file it is possible to restrict actions allowed on target device after import, and to encrypt exported data with password (note, that the application does not use strong encryption).\n\nRecords shown in table and form views can be exported as CSV files for integration with other desktop database or spreadsheet applications. Only data from the fields included in active view are exported. Data in media fields are included in separate files accompanying the text data in CSV file. The application includes meta information in a CSV file which enables full cycle export/synchronized re-import. This allows modifying database records using external tools such as desktop database or spreadsheet programs.\n\nTable and form views can be exported as HTML files, that can be opened using any web browser.\n\nThe on-line documentation included with the application can be accessed from any screen through the Help menu command. The application will automatically display the section of documentation relevant to the currently active screen.\n\nA free version of the application is available for evaluation. The free version has the following limitations:\n- Import, export and print functions are not included.\n- Total maximum number of records in all databases combined is limited to 1000.\n\nThe free version is a fully fledged application with functionality sufficient for many uses. The free version does not contain any advertising or nagging. The free version allows to import initial set of databases from a single native FDB file with unlimited number of records."

      "label": "Shift Worker is designed for people who need a quick and easy way to enter and view their shifts.\n\nA traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter."

      "label": "A study carried out by Worcester Bosch Group's technical support team found that the most common cause of a boiler installation problem was from incorrectly sized gas pipes. When fitting a new boiler, often the existing pipes should be replace for larger ones due to the increased output. Smaller pipes will mean the boiler is running at a lower power and can cause an increase in carbon monoxide levels.\n\nThe Gas Pipe Sizing Calculator is an extremely easy to use app that will help you to select the right size pipes for installations using copper (up to 108mm), steel (up to 300mm) and PE (up to 315mm) pipes of sections up to 250m (820ft) in length. \n\nTo carry out a calculation simply select the gas type, enter the appliance heat input, enter the pipe length, the number of high or low loss fittings (guidance is given in the app), select the type of pipe and then press the 'Calculate' button. \n\nThe results will show the total equivalent length, the minimum pipe diameter (metric) that should be used and the pressure drop for that section of pipe.\n\nFor multiple appliances each section should be calculated in turn and the kW inputs for the appliances in each section added together for each calculation.\n\nThe maximum pressure drop from each appliance to the meter should be no more than 1 mbar for natural gas or 2.5 mbar for butane or propane. Adding all drops together using the minimum pipe diameters may cause this to be exceeded. Where possible, the results will also calculate the drop if the next larger size pipe diameter is selected on a section, this should help to ensure the right sizes are used throughout the whole circuit.\n\nPlease note: This app is designed mainly for the UK so supports metric pipe sizes only."

This app does not detect non-magnetic objects, For example, aluminum or wood studs. \n\nDISCLAIMER: The performance of the app is limited by the construction of the wall, presence of a phone cover and/or the material of the nails in the studs.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf your device has a external case, please remove before using this app.\n\nCalibrate your device’s magnetic sensor by moving the device in a \"Figure 8\" pattern. Then tap the \"Intensity\" reading displayed on the app to set the baseline to zero.\n\nTo accurately detect nails using this app, on iPhone 5s and below, sweep with the right edge of the device against the wall. For iPhone 6 and above, sweep with the top edge of the device along the wall.\n\nSometimes it helps to first figure out the location of the magnet (compass magnet) on your phone using a magnetic material so it becomes clear where to \"mark\" when you find a nail in the stud.\n\n\nLocalization Credits: Laura Klein (French), Ilgiz Khisamov (Russian), Yasu Yu (Chinese), Cem Yolcu (Turkish)"

Of course, hanging one picture is simple. But if you have three or four pictures, each with two hooks on the back, and you want them exactly 6 inches apart, and aligned correctly across your wall? Hang-a-Pic will do just that!\n\nUsing a very friendly walk-through interface, Hang-a-Pic can tell you exactly where to put your nails (or wall-plugs, etc.) in the wall for each picture or ornament. No more headaches or extra holes in the wall from guessing where the nails should go... All you need is a tape measure and Hang-a-Pic will figure out the rest!\n\nIt's so easy that a 12 year old child could take four pictures, each with two hooks on the back, and hang them precisely and evenly across a wall the first time! No extra holes, no \"oops!!\".\n\n- New Features added to support hanging a group of pictures (or anything else) with different frame widths, evenly spaced across a wall. For example, say you're hanging 3 pictures and the center picture is wider than the other 2, Hang-a-Pic will now make this an easy task to pinpoint exactly where your nails need to be for each picture! \n- Now supports as many as 5 pictures (or any thing else you're hanging), and each can be a different width. And they do *not* need to be hung symmetrically! \n- Send measurements to your Email address.\n- Print the measurements to your AirPrint compatible Printer.\n- Performance enhancements.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Hang-a-Pic does not calculate how high you wish to hang pictures, mirrors, etc.. Some prefer staggering the height of each picture, some prefer hanging them all the same height. The height you wish to hang pictures is your particular visual preference. For example, do want them at eye-level or higher up on a wall with very tall ceilings? etc.. It's up to you. Hang-a-Pic will however, calculate perfect spacing between those pictures horizontally."

(Add work address to a work-related group, and home address to a sports group etc.)\n• Contacts do not need to be present in your address book.\n\nAn optional plugin is available to check all the email domains for the addresses in a group, as an error there is a common cause of group email problems. It will also check any new addresses you add.\n\nTIPS\n• Protect privacy by placing addresses in the Bcc: line.\n• To forward an email (with attachments), “Copy to clipboard\" then paste to the address line in your Mail app.\n\nSUPPORT\nWe pride ourselves on the quality of our support and are always happy to hear from you.

RPMmtr analyses those sound patterns to measure RPM (rotational speed) based on state-of-the-art signal processing technology.\n\nThe result of this estimation is shown in three different views. The tachometer view displays the rotational speed at a glance. The color of the dent indicates how clear the measurement is. You can swipe the red ring control and improve the result by specifying the expected RPM range.\nThe tracking view shows the evolution of the rotational speed over time. The accuracy of the measurement is indicated by the size and color of the circles.\nExperts can use the spectrogram view: the graph shows the frequency distribution of the sound. Small arrows show the rotational speed. Adjust the axes scaling by a swipe with one finger.\n\nNotice on usage:\nThe app can estimate the correct rotational speed only in cases if the sound is very clear (i.e. the rotating device generates clear periodic sound patterns with one frequency) and there is no background noise.\nRPMmtr is for educational purposes only. We do not take responsibility for decisions taken by the reader based solely on the information provided in this app."

This app will help you with this as it allows you to create your own message templates that you can reuse every time you need to send a message. \n\nThis app is ideal for individuals that send the same type of email & SMS/text messages regularly, such as sales people, persons that arrange meetings and events on a regular basis etc. It is also very useful if you often send out SMS messages like “I’m running a little bit late but will be there in 10 minutes”.\n\nYou can now also backup and restore template data to your Dropbox account (requires that you have an account registered with Dropbox.com). This allows you to make safety backups of your templates. You can also use backup & restore to transfer data between devices that you own.  \n\nPLEASE NOTE: \n• The SMS sending feature is only available on the iPhone.\n• You can only write text based email templates.

Podium Timer Pro is ready-to-go for individuals, and can be instantly upgraded for use by event staff or AV professionals to synchronize and remotely control one or multiple iOS devices from a single iOS device wirelessly (BluetoothLE-capable devices required).\n\nWhether you are giving a talk, presentation, speech, or lecture, Podium Timer Pro replaces your wristwatch on the podium with something you can actually read and that helps you pace your delivery.\n\nPodium Timer Pro lets you easily configure the length of your talk (up to 99 minutes) as well as the lengths of the three time periods that let you know the end is near. Podium Timer Pro comes with beautiful “skins”, and for each of these looks, you can pick the number colors and effects that are most appropriate for the lighting at your venue.\n\nIn addition to the standard countdown timer, Podium Timer Pro also displays the elapsed time as well as the current time. All views can be seen with just a simple swipe of a nervous finger, or Podium Timer Pro can even automatically cycle through the different timers.\n\nYou can also include messages or reminders to yourself (or send to others after upgrades) during the talk without missing a beat.\n\nIf your job is to time someone's speech, Podium Timer Pro will even keep track of the elapsed time when you (quietly) receive a text message, a calendar reminder, or even a phone call!\n\nAs requested by users of our previous apps, Podium Timer and Podium Timer HD, the following features have been added to Podium Timer Pro,\n• Runs on any iOS 9.0+ device (e.g. \"universal\")\n• 13 alert sounds configurable for the end of each phase of the talk\n• Show or hide timer descriptions depending on lighting\n• Flash or do not flash time when talk is running overtime\n\nWith either In-App Purchase upgrade,\n• Any BluetoothLE-enabled device can act as either the controller/master or as a synchronized clone (e.g. iPhone controls iPad, iPad Mini controls iPhone)\n\nWith the Single-Sync upgrade (for smaller events),\n• One iOS device can synchronize and control ONE other iOS device\n\nWith the Multi-Sync upgrade (for AV professionals and large rooms),\n• One iOS device can synchronize and control MULTIPLE other iOS devices"

      "label": "YOUR PERSONAL PREFLOP POKER TRAINER - GTO PREFLOP RANGES AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nOne of the foundations to playing winning tournament poker is playing solid preflop ranges.  Thanks to preflop solvers, we now know what a solid preflop range is.  Used by many tournament poker professionals, The Preflop Advantage is the perfect tool to become a preflop master and start crushing your opponents.\n\nThe Preflop Advantage has more than 2300 preflop ranges made for 8-max & heads up tournaments.  The ranges are exact GTO outputs that have been rounded to 10%.  There are ranges for every position and verse every position so you will never be left guessing if you made the right preflop play.\n\nYou will receive ranges for the following preflop scenarios:\n\n- Raise First In - 15bb, 20bb, 25bb, 30bb, 40bb, 50bb, 100bb\n\n- vs 3bet - 15bb, 20bb, 25bb, 30bb, 40bb, 50bb, 100bb\n\n- vs Raise First In - 15bb, 20bb, 25bb, 30bb, 40bb, 50bb, 100bb\n\n- Multi - Way - 30bb - 40bb - 50bb - 100bb\n\n- Rejamming - 10bb, 12bb, 15bb, 20bb, 25bb, 30bb\n\n- Calling Rejams - 10bb, 12bb, 15bb, 20bb, 25bb, 30bb\n\n- Push / Fold - 5bb - 20bb\n\n- Call Push - 5bb - 20bb\n\n- Heads Up - 10bb, 15bb, 20bb, 25bb, 30bb, 40bb, 50bb, 60bb, 80bb, 100bb\n\n- Blind vs Blind - 15bb, 20bb, 25bb, 30bb, 40bb, 50bb, 100bb\n\n- Limping - 10bb, 15bb, 20bb\n\nThe ranges are broken down by your position, your opponents position (if you have one), and the stack size.  Easy to navigate and use, you will quickly become a preflop master.\n\nThe Raise First In, vs 3bet, vs RFI, Multi - Way, Heads Up, and Limping  ranges were created with Simple Preflop.  Antes were set at 12.5% ante, 100bb stack was run to 60 iterations per node while the rest were run to 100 iteration per node.  \n\nThe Push/Fold, Call Push, Rejam, and Call Rejam ranges were created with Holdem Resources Calculator.  Push / Fold and Call Push both have 12.5% ante's and no antes.  For Rejam and Call Rejam, the opening ranges are the same ranges that were used in the Raise First In Ranges.  Some hands that were break-even or marginal have been removed from the ranges.\n\nAll the ranges are stored on your phone so once you download the app, you are good to go.  No internet connection required to use the app.\n\nThe Preflop Advantage was built for and by professional tournament players.  We believe our app is the best preflop poker trainer on the market and at an affordable price.  The app is easy to navigate and read, making it the perfect tool so you can check your ranges while you're playing (please make sure your room allows players to use charts).  \n\nIf you are a tournament player that is serious about your game, you need The Preflop Advantage.

We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

Simply select the type of gas, enter a value, select the units, press the 'Calculate' button and the calculator will show all gas rates (cubic metres per hour, cubic feet per hour and litres per second) and heat inputs (MJ/h, kW and BTUs per hour) based on the CV.\n\nThe Tightness Testing function allows you to quickly select between the let-by and tightness tests and has an easy to use timer. No longer do you need to fiddle about with your phone's timer!\n\nCalorific values can be entered manually (and saved) for more accurate gas rate calculation results. The calorific value of natural gas in the UK varies from about 38.3 to 40.5 MJ per cubic metre; this can mean a difference in the gas rate calculation of more than 5%! With this calculator you can add the CV for your area in the settings page and avoid these inaccuracies. The default values set for butane and propane are both the same as supplied by Calor and BOC.\n\nThe metric timer can be set to either 1 or 2 minutes. For U6 and G4 meters one minute is sufficient, for E6 meters two minutes is recommended for accuracy. The timer can be set to an audible alert, vibrate, both or neither.\n\nA torch function is included with this app if your device has an LED flash."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

Simply input when you completed the currency and how long it is valid for, and its expiry date is automatically calculated; or for irregular currencies you can manually input the expiry date instead, giving you maximum control. Your currencies list is colour-coded and can be sorted 'expiring soonest', 'completed recently' or 'alphabetically', making it simple for you to prioritise what's important.\n\nCurrency Genie also reminds you in advance of your currencies expiring, and again on the expiration date, ensuring you never forget to book that all important simulator trip again. There's no limit to what you can add; from medical and dental assessments, to instrument ratings and airworthiness certifications.\n\nCurrency Genie: The Flying Currencies Tracker."

For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused.

To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees.

Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!"

Simply select the type of gas, enter a value, select the units, press the 'Calculate' button and the calculator will show all gas rates (cubic metres per hour, cubic feet per hour and litres per second) and heat inputs (MJ/h, kW and BTUs per hour) based on the CV.\n\nThe Tightness Testing function allows you to quickly select between the let-by and tightness tests and has an easy to use timer. No longer do you need to fiddle about with your phone's timer!\n\nCalorific values can be entered manually (and saved) for more accurate gas rate calculation results. The calorific value of natural gas in the UK varies from about 38.3 to 40.5 MJ per cubic metre; this can mean a difference in the gas rate calculation of more than 5%! With this calculator you can add the CV for your area in the settings page and avoid these inaccuracies. The default values set for butane and propane are both the same as supplied by Calor and BOC.\n\nThe metric timer can be set to either 1 or 2 minutes. For U6 and G4 meters one minute is sufficient, for E6 meters two minutes is recommended for accuracy. The timer can be set to an audible alert, vibrate, both or neither.\n\nA torch function is included with this app if your device has an LED flash."

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research?

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "One evening, after a very long week of shows we were sat in the office looking at the show times wishing the running times would work them selves out (we've all been there), it was at this moment this show timing app was created. Welcome to the future of show timing without multiple stop watches and reminder alarms. Now you can start your show with the press of one button and the app does the rest. With unlimited Acts and Intervals in any configuration that you like! , just set your show structure, tell it your interval duration(s) and away you go. \n\nShow StopWatch also handles separate in act timers and show stops, adjusting the running and playing times accordingly! Once you have completed a show you can then email the times with a simple button press or copy them your clipboard as well as storing them for later. \n\nThere is also the option to have pre show notifications for back stage calls and the same again in the interval so you don't have to spend all your time looking at the clock. The app will also run in the back ground of your phone if for what ever reason you need to use your phone for something else (certainly not facebook, for those long scenes with no cues) while its running. \n\nThis app was created by stage managers for stage managers, it is currently being used by a number of productions and companies including UK Tours, West End shows and Repertory Theatres. It will continue to be a working development so any thing you come across that you think ‘it would be great if’ please don't hesitate to get in contact! It became apparent while testing how tiny details make a difference to everyone so we have tried to incorporate them all, for example; the interval timer shows both time elapsed and remaining, and is in green until you start over running when it goes red (because how often do you go up on time), and the ability to access times so far, for those quiet moments where you are able to start the show report early!\n\nThis app has not been made to replace your note book, still write times down if you get a chance, its simply to try and make life easier at the end of the show! Have a play, get to know it and let us know how you get on!\n\nIf you want to get in contact email me at jackrlord@gmail.com"

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "\"Oblique Strategies\" is a concept developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks through lateral thinking. It consists of a deck of cards, each one containing a vague or ambiguous phrase that can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.\n\nThis app aims to translate the essence of the original cards deck into a digital experience, making it accessible to a wider audience. It contains the original edition, as well as the newer decks, presenting them in a sleek minimalist style inspired by the original design of the cards. The user interface is simple and straightforward, built to encourage creative or design thinking without distracting from the process. The home screen widget on iOS 14 allows reading a new quote every day without opening the application. The Apple Watch version can run independently without needing the app installed on your iPhone.\n\nWith VoiceOver, anyone with a visual impairment can have the Oblique Strategies phrase read to them. Long tap the screen to have the last sentence read to you again. Also, you can shake the iPhone for a new sentence."

We all have good intentions but we need a bit of encouragement here and there. Doing the laundry is an epic feat of stamina so why not get stamina points for it?!\n\nThe to-do list is fully-featured and supports repeating tasks, displays reminders for overdue events and allows time-critical events to be assigned to specific days, while more aspirational quests can be set to \"someday\" so you don't lose sight of your goals. And each task completed is destroyed by your avatar, so get your Undead Warrior to beat-up your laundry, or your Treeman to headbutt your overspilling inbox.\n\nThe app is supplied with 5 animated avatars which grow in characteristics that represent your own life. Will you be a Maiden of Juggled Priorities, or a King of Win? The lifestyle you lead will decide."

      "label": "TomatoFlex is a productivity app based on the pomodoro time management technique - focusing on simplicity.\n\nIt comes with a standalone Apple Watch, iPhone and iPad app, synchronised when used together.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 3 different Apple Watch complication types, supporting all watch faces\n- 5 different types of iOS widgets\n- Work/break settings from 1 minute to 90 minutes\n- Apple Watch alarm and actionable iOS notifications\n- Seamless synronisation of your session and statistics across all the supported devices\n- Smart statistics which automatically groups sets and detects breaks\n- Unlimited statistics history which you can export to csv\n- Hourly productive breakdown and daily focus time tracking\n- Stop, Pause and partial pomodoro completion\n- Skip break when you are in flow\n- Recents tracking for quick switch between intervals\n- Add or delete pomodoro completions if you forgot to start tracking\n- iCloud saving of statistics to never lose your history\n- iPad multitasking\n- Light and dark theme\n- Shortcuts integration\n\n\nMore details for black belt pomodoro ninjas:\n\nIt is flexible because it does not force you into intervals with second precision. It just notifies you about the interval end and you decide when do you want to continue with the next interval. This is more realistic in a real world scenario as you might need an extra minute or so to complete your current work before you want to go for a break. It is a similar experience as a traditional analog pomodoro timer. Our statistics module can figure out what counts as a set or break, so you still get the same insight and discipline for your focused work. \n\nIf you have any question don't hesitate to reach us at [company@talkingchickenfriend.com](mailto:company@talkingchickenfriend.com)\n\n\"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.\" - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)"

Place your mobile device along the incline of the stairs and register the displayed degrees by conveniently tapping the arrow button provided. This will transfer the value to the angle entry box, so no more awkward elevation measurements and spirit levels.\n\nWhen you have completed filling in the 4 entry boxes then tap on the \"Calculate\" button to show the results with a list of spindle positions and spacing widths adjusted for the slope. \n\nYou may need to tweak the regulation maximum spacing, defaulting at 98mm, to take into account turned spindles with tapering profiles. \n\nIt should be noted that the underlying algorithm works out best fit within a millimeter or so. Under certain circumstances you are invited to adjust the maximum regulation width slightly and recalculate to perhaps reduce by one the number of spindles. Bear in mind that the legal maximum is 100mm in the UK. or usually 4 inches in the USA ."

      "label": "First released in June 2010, CopyIt is the original and most feature rich grid drawing app available anywhere! See why so many artists, teachers and students are using CopyIt as an essential tool in their workflows.\n\nNEW USERS - PLEASE NOTE:\nDue to the large number of features in CopyIt, the toolbars are scrollable.  Try scrolling each toolbar to access all of the available buttons.\n\nUsed by artists such as Vincent Van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci, the grid drawing method has been brought to digital life with CopyIt. CopyIt assists you in copying, enlarging or reducing your chosen reference image using the grid drawing method. You do not even need to be artistic.\n\nThe grid drawing method has been used for centuries. It breaks images down into smaller work areas allowing you to focus on the actual lines and shapes within each square, rather than trying to draw the whole picture at once. You can't help but achieve with this method.\n\nUsing CopyIt as your reference object, it saves you from having to print your photos and ruin them by drawing grids over them, but unlike a real photo, it gives you the ability to zoom into the fine details.  With a pencil, you then draw up a grid with the same number of squares using a separate medium, such as paper or canvas. Working square by square, you CopyIt!\n\nIf you want to draw an image larger or smaller than the original, the pencil-drawn grid should be drawn larger or smaller than the original grid on the device with the same amount of squares.  All that matters is that the contents of each square are drawn to scale.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Comprehensive Help\n- Portrait or Landscape orientation\n- Universal App, compatible with iPad, iPhone and iPod touch\n- Fullscreen mode (hides toolbars)\n- Built-in Music player\n- Audible feedback (can be turned off)\n- Extra options in the Settings App\n- Set your Maximum Zoom level from x1 to x20\n- CopyIt can resist entering standby while in use\n- TubeMatch™ for approximating paint and pencil colours\n- Mosaic to average surrounding colours into coloured squares\n- Tonal Strip to help identify values\n- Media types (Imperial and Metric)\n\nGrid Options:\n- 6 Grid Types\n- Preset or custom Columns, Rows and Points grid sizing options\n- To maintain the grid visibility regardless of your photo, choose from 9 grid colors, Black (default), Gray, White, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange and Magenta\n- Grid transparency is adjustable in 5% increments \n- 5 different Grid Line thicknesses\n- Grid letters and numbers (now 8 different formats)\n- A center point in each grid square \n- Guidelines: 1/4 and 1/16 to help you copy your subject\n- Solid or Dashed Guidelines\n- Guideline colour can be set independently to Grid colour\n- SmartMove: Just touch a square once to zoom to that square\n- SmartMove: takes advantage of your maximum zoom setting, never zooming in more than that amount\n- Target mode highlights the current square and dims the rest, helping you to focus your attention\n\nFilters and Effects:\n- 12 Primary Filters\n- 6 Secondary Filters\n- Onion Skin Feature: Overlay your reference image above your work to quickly assess your accuracy\n- 12 different image aspects \n- Rotate the image in 90 degree increments\n- Vertical and Horizontal Flip image\n\nImport Options:\n- Cameras are supported - both front and back\n- Load Project\n- Load From Photo Album\n\nExport Options:\n- Save Project\n- Export Photo (AirDrop, email, message, print, export to Facebook, Twitter etc)\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to use CopyIt, a user guide is available within the App and on the Support website.\n\nYou can contact the developer on Facebook or Twitter.\nwww.facebook.com/CopyItTheGridDrawingMethod or @copyitforios\n\nThank you to all our users for their feedback and feature suggestions which have helped make CopyIt what it is today."

      "label": "Eisenhower is a time management solution based on the Eisenhower matrix, supporting you in prioritizing and getting tasks done by urgency and importance. It helps you organizing both your business and personal tasks altogether, reducing stress while increasing productivity at the same time.\n\nOther apps focus on collecting many lists and tasks, Eisenhower helps you to actually complete the ones that really matter—through providing a framework to filter incoming tasks and maximize the happy feeling of completion when finishing or delegating them.\n\n—————\nJoin many others and become more productive today!\n—————\n\nWhat our users are saying about Eisenhower:\n\n▶ \"Perfect for those with busy lifestyles or who just want to get things done.\"\n\n▶ \"Get this, now, not later. This is how Eisenhower ran a country, might be good for your productivity too.\"\n\n▶ \"Helps me to be productive - quick, easy, efficient.\"\n\n▶ \"This could be the next big thing in productivity apps.\"\n\n▶ \"I absolutely love this application and I find it to actually be hugely useful - having played with it the whole day today and populated it out with tasks I want to achieve to test the theory, I indeed finished each of the \"Do First\" tasks in order, and achieved Zero-Inbox. This is the most productive day I've had in months!\"\n\n—————\nFEATURES\n—————\n\n▶ Task Counter\nOn each to-do sheet, best manage no more than 8 tasks. Still, we have made room for unlimited tasks and notes whenever you might need it—and each sheet counts how many there are to tackle right now.\n\n▶ Focus Mode\nFor urgent and important tasks, you can use a special timer, helping you to focus on only one task for 30 minutes—or whatever duration you like best.\n\n▶ Schedule & Delegate\nUsing other task-related actions, you can directly place reminders in your calendar or send e-mails including the tasks to co-workers.\n\n▶ Cloud Sync\nOnce you have created your account, Eisenhower automatically syncs with the free web client on app.eisenhower.me—and vice versa, in real-time!\n\n—————\nMORE\n—————\n\nIf you are new to the Eisenhower matrix or just want to refresh your memory, check out our quick video tutorial here: bit.ly/eisenhower-matrix\n\nGet in Touch\nGot feedback for us?

Simply input when you completed the currency and how long it is valid for, and its expiry date is automatically calculated; or for irregular currencies you can manually input the expiry date instead, giving you maximum control. Your currencies list is colour-coded and can be sorted 'expiring soonest', 'completed recently' or 'alphabetically', making it simple for you to prioritise what's important.\n\nCurrency Genie also reminds you in advance of your currencies expiring, and again on the expiration date, ensuring you never forget to book that all important simulator trip again. There's no limit to what you can add; from medical and dental assessments, to instrument ratings and airworthiness certifications.\n\nCurrency Genie: The Flying Currencies Tracker."

However, she has never seen a QWERTY keyboard in her life. For her, typing on it is as painful as trying to write your name by fishing out all the needed letters from an alphabet soup. With this keyboard she now sends frequent text messages and typing has become much easier.\n\nThis success story motivated me to develop this fully compatible custom keyboard. It helps people that are not used to the QWERTY layout to type faster and easier. If you stumble across this app and know someone who could benefit from it, please spread the word :)\n\nThe keyboard does not require \"Full access\" like many other third-party keyboards and does not save any usage data."

      "label": "Unstuck is a simple tool to help you break through difficult interpersonal, management, substantive, and organizational challenges. Unstuck guides you through the process of peer coaching -- a proven approach to collaboratively solving problems.   This app supports that process by providing structure, suggesting helpful coaching questions, and guiding you toward new perspectives and insights that will help you overcome whatever challenges you're facing.\n\n*** What is peer coaching? ***\nPeer coaching is a widely used framework in organizations, schools, and workplaces, as a way to collaboratively find solutions when facing a difficult challenge.  In a two-person coaching session, one person is the learner -- the person seeking a fresh perspective on a challenge.  The other person is the coach -- someone who listens and asks probing, helpful questions.  \n\nUnstuck guides you through the three stages of peer coaching: \n1) The learner describes the \"what, where, when, and who\" of their challenge so that the coach understands the situation; \n2) The coach asks questions to help the learner talk through the problem and expand their thinking;\n3) Both the learner and the coach have an opportunity to reflect on what they've learned.\n\nUnstuck leads you through these stages by tracking the time, prompting you to move on to the next stage, and even offering questions to consider.  This allows you to focus on the coaching.\n\n*** Why use peer coaching? ***\n\nPeer coaching can help you see new approaches to difficult personal, workplace, or social challenges.  But peer coaching can help in other ways, too!  According to research in the Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, peer coaching can help heighten self-awareness, improve active listening skills, enhance interpersonal connections, and improve leadership skills.  This is why peer coaching is taught in leadership and management training programs around the world.\n\n*** How do I get started? ***\n\nIt's easy to get started.  All you need to do is find a trusted friend or colleague willing to be your coach. Their job is to help you think through the challenge by listening and asking thoughtful questions, not giving advice or telling you what to do. Customize your Unstuck session to fit your schedule. Whether you have an hour or only 10 minutes to talk with your coach, Unstuck will help you make the most of whatever time that you have.\n\n*** Can I use Unstuck on my own? ***\n\nYes! Unstuck is primarily designed to help two people do peer coaching together (in person or remotely).  But by using Unstuck's built-in question library, you can be your own coach and think through challenges on your own.\n\n*** Do I need special training? ***\n\nNo!  Unstuck makes it easy to begin peer coaching.  Neither the learner nor the coach needs any kind of special training or expertise -- just a willingness to listen and think. And if the coach gets stuck, Unstuck can suggest questions!"

There are also detailed status messages, such as a time calculation until the object is finished or the possibility to cancel a print. This is especially useful when you want to check at a glance that everything is okay during the printing process. The advantage is that you can intervene in time to create the object in perfect shape. Just enter the internal IP address of the device under the settings and you're ready to go. You can use the settings on your Dremel to set a local IP address or use the automatically assigned V4 IP address. You can find the IP address of your Dremel 3D40 or 3D45 in the settings. The status display contains information about progress, nozzle temperature, time, open or closed doors, platform temperature, chamber temperature, print file name and file type. In this new version, you can switch the temperature display between Celsius and Fahrenheit."

      "label": "Sketch 3D is a tool for designing 3D models from your fingertips.  You could download models from others, and could also share your great designs with other users by saving models in Public space.\n\nNew feature: Use True Depth Camera to capture face model.\n\nNew feature: Support using video as model texture.\nYou could use video clips from Photo Album, or from Internet URL (YouTube URL not supported), and then apply it onto a model as texture map.\n\nNew feature: Capture movie from the 3D scene.  \nNote! If your device could not capture movie, then, could try out a smaller output resolution (by tapping the control pane). However, arbitrary output size may stop capturing prematurely.\n\nNew feature: Design 3D model animation with skeleton structure.  \nYou could design a skeleton structure by placing bones in hierarchical relation.  Attach model to the skeleton, and then moving the bones to define different poses.  Each pose represented as a keyframe in the timeline view.  And animation sequence is produced by playing interpolation between the keyframes.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nFeatures:\n- Import 3D content directly from browser or email, either in .zip, .rar, .7z.\n- Support formats: Collada DAE, OBJ, 3DS, STL(for 3D printing), and others.\n- Import/export to iCloud drive, via iTune File Sharing, or to Public area via Apple CloudKit Service.\n- Supports AirDrop.\n- Support Quad faces.\n- Smooth surfaces using Subdivision.\n- Mirroring editing.\n- 2-fingers vertex movement, 3 or 4-fingers planar shape creation.\n- Versatile multi-touches drag-through-space gestures to support editing and changing viewing angle at the same time.\n- Flexible face strip drawing.\n- Stitching boundary faces.

      "label": "A study carried out by Worcester Bosch Group's technical support team found that the most common cause of a boiler installation problem was from incorrectly sized gas pipes. When fitting a new boiler, often the existing pipes should be replace for larger ones due to the increased output. Smaller pipes will mean the boiler is running at a lower power and can cause an increase in carbon monoxide levels.\n\nThe Gas Pipe Sizing Calculator is an extremely easy to use app that will help you to select the right size pipes for installations using copper (up to 108mm), steel (up to 300mm) and PE (up to 315mm) pipes of sections up to 250m (820ft) in length. \n\nTo carry out a calculation simply select the gas type, enter the appliance heat input, enter the pipe length, the number of high or low loss fittings (guidance is given in the app), select the type of pipe and then press the 'Calculate' button. \n\nThe results will show the total equivalent length, the minimum pipe diameter (metric) that should be used and the pressure drop for that section of pipe.\n\nFor multiple appliances each section should be calculated in turn and the kW inputs for the appliances in each section added together for each calculation.\n\nThe maximum pressure drop from each appliance to the meter should be no more than 1 mbar for natural gas or 2.5 mbar for butane or propane. Adding all drops together using the minimum pipe diameters may cause this to be exceeded. Where possible, the results will also calculate the drop if the next larger size pipe diameter is selected on a section, this should help to ensure the right sizes are used throughout the whole circuit.\n\nPlease note: This app is designed mainly for the UK so supports metric pipe sizes only."

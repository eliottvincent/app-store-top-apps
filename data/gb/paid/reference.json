      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

We will be making the recordings and the data collected on species identification freely available to be used for research and conservation.\n\nWarblr can recognise over 220 species of British bird, and works particularly well for garden and woodland species.

Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB.

      "label": "*** This mobile field guide includes all 492 bird species likely to be found on the islands of Trinidad & Tobago. This makes this app the one and only to date mobile bird guide to this region! The content is mainly derived from Bloomsbury's Helm Guide \"Birds of Trinidad and Tobago\". Covering 492 species with 1,200 superb illustrations and 972 songs and calls. All distinct plumages including all variations and subspecies are illustrated. ***\n\nThe app's content is mainly based on the second edition of \"Birds of Trinidad and Tobago\" by Martyn Kenefick, Robin Restall and Floyd Hayes. Comprehensive descriptions for each species were taken from the renowned two volume reference work \"Birds of Northern South America\" by Robin Restall, Clemencia Rodner, and Miguel Lentino. The app also contains some species which haven't been recorded on T&T so far but are likely to be spotted if known what to look out for (some swallows and swifts). All of these are illustrated too. The creation of apps from the books is a co-production between Bloomsbury Plc and Sunbird Images. \n\nWith over half a million downloads and over 100 apps published to date Sunbird Images became the true market leader in mobile field guides in recent years. \n\nSUNBIRD apps have been featured over 300 times by Apple in different countries, and appeared in many magazines, newspapers such as the Times, the Telegraph and described as \"incredibly useful\" by ITV's Seth Convey and \"lovely\" by Adam Vaughan of the Guardian.\n\nThis app is part of the Sunbird Images BLUE LABEL series. Our BLUE LABEL series are top notch digital field guides which provide the most comprehensive data available for a region or taxon. They stand for completeness including even the very rare species and vagrants which have only been recorded once in a region. Even the rare species are illustrated and described in detail featured with a full species account.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Includes all 492 bird species of Trinidad and Tobago \n- Select species of each country separately\n- 1,200 illustrations show all subspecies + geographic, age and sex variants\n- Most advanced Compare Mode of any bird app - compare up to 16 species images / songs / maps\n- 972 bird songs and calls\n- Sonograms of all songs + details where songs were recorded\n- Detailed distribution maps of Northern South America down to subspecies level\n- Introduction contains detailed hints and links on bird watching on the islands\n- Create sighting lists and sort by place, date, group, and name\n- Automatically plots all birds on a map via GPS (editable)\n- Make notes for each bird spotted\n- A simple id key makes species identification easy \n- Sort and display species: A–Z, 6 different languages, taxonomic listing\n\n\n*** Ornithomedia writes: \"Ergonomie agréable et claire\" ***\n\n\nChoose between 6 bird name languages: \nEnglish, Latin, Spanish, French, Dutch, German\n\nNarrow species down by foot colour, bill shape, tail length etc. leading to the bird searched for plus a choice of similar species. You can also look for fragments of a species name – the search for “finch“ shows all the species which include the word “finch“ in the species’ name.\n\n***A graphically well-designed layout – easy to use with large lettering.*** \n\nOnce downloaded no internet connection needed – just download the app and start birding! The app will be continuously developed further. All updates are free of charge. \n\nVisit our internet support site for more information www.sunbird.tv.

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

      "label": "The original and the best, WinterTreeId is an easy to use but comprehensive field guide to trees found growing in open countryside and natural woodland of the British Isles. The guide has been created by professional published ecologists, accept no cheap imitations!\n\nAll native British tree species are covered. Naturalised species are covered too. \n\nTreeId was one of BBC Countryfile's top 10 apps and described as \"incredibly useful\" by ITV's Seth Conway and \"a lovely app\" by Adam Vaughan of the Guardian. It was voted No. 5 in the Guardian Green Living top 10 apps and was given the  \"Best\" award by iPhone Apps Plus.\n\nHave you ever been on a walk in the countryside during the winter months  and wondered \"What tree is that?\". WinterTreeId is a great tool to help you  identify trees during the winter months when the tree may have no leaves, flowers or fruits to go on. Its great fun to use too. With WinterTreeId, identification can be enjoyed by the whole family, and can engage children with the natural world around them. For the tree enthusiast, there is comprehensive anatomical and ecological information, with high quality images of every species.\n\nWhen you have identified a tree, why not record your sighting  using our mapping screen. You can share your sighting with all other users too if you like. See how many species you can identify this winter!\n\nThere is a great quiz that really improves your id skills. Compete to be our highest scorer!\n\nThe app does not need an internet connection, all content is downloaded when the app is purchased.\n\nSUNBIRD IMAGES field guides are the only products on the market that use the KUSAM species identification methodology. This state of the art method is a modern taxonomic keying system designed specifically for use on mobile devices."

      "label": "Quick reference guide for rock hounds to identify and learn about the rocks, gems, and minerals that they are looking to collect. Designed for easy use and fast response without information overload.\n\nThis App gives you information and pictures of the most common types of samples collected, such as Garnets, Agates, Geodes. It is not cluttered with information about samples that rock hounds are not interested in. Who is looking for Allanite or Manganbabingtonite? \n\nFeatures of this App:\n   - View information and pictures of the most common collected rocks, gems, and minerals.\n\n   - Search by name and information to narrow your results to view.\n\n   - Add your own using pictures from your Photo Library. Enter name and description of your new addition and assign pictures from your Photo Library for the Icon and Pics pages. Once the pics are added from your Photo Library, they can be deleted, as the picture information is stored in the App.\n\n   - Tips section gives information about collecting as well as App specific information.\n\n   - Gallery section gives you the ability to showcase just the rocks you have. Organized by their pictures and sorted by their Name, Type, or Rating. Share them to others or save to your Photo Library.\n\n   - No internet connection needed. All data stored locally, so it is still usable in locations that may not be out of network range.\n\n    - No Ads or in-App purchases. Nothing else to buy.\n\nIf you have an iPhone, you may be interested in the app \"RockHound\", which contains GPS data of collection sites and what you will find there, along with this module for identification. The RockHound app will not work on the iPod Touch, since the GPS data is critical for its use."

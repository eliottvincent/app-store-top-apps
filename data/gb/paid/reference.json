      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

      "label": "The original and the best, accept no cheap imitations ! \nRecord a bird singing and use Automatic Recognition to help identify it. Unlike all other apps, no internet or mobile connection is needed.\n\n•   The Times Newspaper said the app \"Does what it says on the \n\ntin\" and were amazed that \"this astonishing piece of software \ncosts about the same as a cup of coffee\".\n\n•   \"In direct comparison Bird Song Id showed better results than Chirpomatic\". - naturschutz.ch - Swiss Birding Magazine \n\nCopied by a few, bettered by none, Bird Song Id is three years  \nahead of anyone else in this field !\n\n•   The Telegraph Newspaper said \"Bird Song Id is a good walk improved, and may even put a spring in your step\".\n\n•   over 1000 good ratings\n\nAutomatic Recognition takes place on the device, no connection to the internet or mobile network is needed.\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs good quality recordings to work. See the HELP below, or follow the Developer Website link to find out how to improve your recordings.\n\nAutomatic Recognition will help identify a good cross section of bird song in the British Isles, but you will need a good quality recording. Lots of blue and green peaks reaching to the top of the analysis graph is a good indication of a quality recording. Help and examples are included in the app to guide you.\n\nHow successful is it ? Our aim is to get the correct bird in the top three of those listed. In our testing of over 1,000 samples we found the success rate to be 85%.\n\nFollow the Developer Website link to see a demo of Automatic Recognition on YouTube\n\n--------------- HELP ----------------\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs a good quality recording of the bird.\n-------------\nOnly record when a single bird is singing, or when a single bird is dominant\n-------------\nThe analysis graph should have plenty of blue and green colors with few or no black peaks.\n-------------\nThe peaks on the graph should reach all the way to the top. Low peaks indicate poor quality and recognition is unlikely.\n-------------\nThe Audio Quality, shown at the top of the results screen, should be at least Good, and preferably Very Good or Excellent\n-------------\nThe highest score should be above 70% to be useful. Below this and the system is telling you it is not sure what the song is.\n-------------\nA difference between two birds of less than 10% is not that significant, so listen to the samples from both to help you further\n-------------\nSee the samples for how the analysis graph should look (to see the samples press the sample button at the top right of the help page)\n-------------\nMake sure it is very quiet apart from the bird song which should be nice and loud\n-------------\nBe as close to the bird as you can be without disturbing it\n-------------\nBe patient, dont expect miracles, the system works but needs good clear recordings\n-------------\nThe microphone is at the bottom of an iPhone, point the bottom of the phone towards the bird\n-------------\nRemove the case from your iPhone if you use one as this can dampen the microphone\n-------------\nRecord a single bird at a time\n-------------\nCapture at least two singing episodes if you can. \n-------------\nRecord for the full 30 seconds\n-------------\nAvoid windy conditions. Air moving over the microphone will mask the bird sounds\n-------------\nMake sure there is plenty of life in the battery. Your device will reduce power going to the microphone as the battery runs down\n-------------\nPlaying songs to the app from recorded material on the internet, other apps or CDs is unlikely to work as this material is digitally processed and edited (inter phase gaps are often shortened). They sound very different to recording birds for real on an iPhone or iPad in the natural environment. Its a bit like putting rocket fuel in a lawn mower.\n-------------"

Automatically note the current date, time, latitude, longitude and Grid Reference. The app includes iCloud syncing, so that if you have more than one device (iPhone, iPod or iPad) your sightings will automatically synchronise.\n\n\"I don't say this often, but you guys should charge more for this neat little piece of work! I almost feel guilty now, for the price!\" - AppStore review\n\nGreat features! This is the ONLY budget British bird app with the following features: \n• A photo-based BIRD FINDER based on appearance, habitat, location, date and more \n• Carefully selected photos of MALES, FEMALES and JUVENILES, to show the main features \n• Labelled photos of KEY FEATURES \n• A COMPARE IMAGES feature \n• A SONG or CALL for EVERY BIRD \n• A HISTORY feature to make it easy to go back to the last bird you looked at \n• Select the birds for the area WHERE YOU LIVE \n• European distribution maps for EVERY BIRD \n• A BACK-UP system so you can save your data \n• iCLOUD syncing to synchronise your sightings across your devices \n\nThe Pocket Birds app includes birds that are likely to be seen without making a special trip, plus well-known species.

The guide has been created by professional published ecologists, accept no cheap imitations!\n\nOne of BBC Countryfile's top 10 apps and one of the World Wildlife Fund's top 10 apps. Described as \"incredibly useful\" by ITV's Seth Conway and \"a lovely app\" by Adam Vaughan of the Guardian. It was voted No. 5 in the Guardian Green Living top 10 apps and was given the \"Best\" award by iPhone Apps Plus. Our app is the only tree identification app in the Woodland Trust top apps list.\n\nHave you ever been on a walk in the countryside and wondered \"What tree is that?\"? TreeId is a great tool to help you quickly and easily identify trees you find in the British countryside. It's great fun to use, too. With TreeId, identification can be enjoyed by the whole family, and can engage children with the natural world around them. For the tree enthusiast, there is comprehensive anatomical and ecological information, with high quality images of the leaf, flower, fruit etc. of every species.\n\nWhen you have identified a tree, why not take a photo and record it on our map. See how many species you can identify this year!\n\nThe app does not need an internet connection, all content is downloaded when the app is purchased.\n\nSUNBIRD IMAGES field guides are the only products on the market that use the KUSAM species identification methodology. This state of the art method is a modern taxonomic keying system designed specifically for use on mobile devices."

      "label": "Read the 99 Names of Allah on you're iPod, iPad and iPhone :)\n\n The 99 Names of Allah (Asma ul Husna), are the Names of God. Each representing a certain Attribute or Description of God. Allah(Swt) says in the Glorious Quran: \"He is Allah (God), the Creator, the Originator, The Fashioner, to Him belong the most beautiful names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth, do declare His praises and Glory. And He is the Exalted in Might, The Wise.\" [Quran 59:24]\n\n App Features:\n \n• Read the names in Arabic, English with Meanings\n • Read the English Translation of the Meaning of Quran in Description for each name.\n• Full Audio Controls: Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind and Forward\n • Auto-Scroll: Automatically scrolls and plays each name\n • Universal App Works with iPod, iPad and iPhone\n\nDownload Now and Memorize the 99 names of Allah Subhanahu Ta'ala today!\n\n   DISCLAIMER: It should be noted that the names of Allaah are not limited to a certain number. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the saheeh hadeeth (Ahmad 3704): “O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave… I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You.” What Allaah has preserved in the knowledge of the unseen with Him cannot be known and what is not known is unlimited.\n\nWith regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Allaah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one. Whoever learns them will enter Paradise,” this does not mean that He does not have any names apart from these, rather it means that whoever learns these ninety-nine of His names will enter Paradise. This is like when the Arabs say: “I have one hundred horses which I have prepared for struggle for the sake of Allaah,” which does not mean that the speaker has only these hundred horses, rather these hundred are prepared for this purpose. (Fatwa: https://islamqa.info/en/41003)\n \nIt also should be remembered that Quran was revealed in Arabic language. Translations are actually Interpretation of the Quran. No translation of the Quran can be hundred percent accurate, nor it can be used as a replacement of the original Quranic text in Arabic. If you come across any mistakes please report them to us by contacting us via: http://www.ImranQureshi.com. May Allah (Subhanahu Ta'ala) accept this service from all of us, please remember us in you're Dua's."

God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse.

A short description and helpful tips are given for each song or call, as well as a photo of each bird. Birds can be sorted by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to rarer species. Or sort by song style, so that you can compare birds that hoot and coo, or those with high pitched songs for example. You can also sort by name, habitat or bird group.\n\nAfter listening, try the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nThe slideshow section can be used as a way to relax, or switch the voiceover on and see if you can say the name of the bird before the voiceover. This is a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?! \n\nIncludes birds from Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Italy."

The common mushroom, dearly loved treasure in many kitchens. But once it's found, fundamental doubts replace the initial euphoria. What kind of mushroom is this actually? Is it edible, perhaps toxic, even hallucinogenic? A mushroom identification manual would be useful now - but who likes to crawl through the undergrowth with a bulky book?!\n\n\nNATURE MOBILE has developed an app for all smartphone users that helps with identifying and collecting mushrooms - Mushrooms PRO. With more than *300* species and over *2000* high-resolution images it doesn't have to hide in the thicket. For each mushroom there is a comprehensive description and a selection of images of different perspectives and life tilt. Not only occasional collectors will have their fun with the app - mycologists will enjoy it, too, as the content of the app has been compiled by Dr. GERHARDT, author of many mushroom books and scientific publications about mycology. Dr. GERHARDT has been a long term employee and consultant of Mycology at the Botanical Gardens and in the Botanical Museum of Berlin.\n\n\nSO HOW CAN A MUSHROOM BE IDENTIFIED?\n\nYou can choose from a variety of visual and other characteristic features and thus reduce the list of eligible mushroom species.\n\n\nYOUR PERSONAL TRAINER!\n\n* Learning* with a picture quiz. Polyporus Brumalis, Echinoderma Asperum or rather Armillaria Ostoyae? In case you don't know the right answer to a question, you still have 2 more mushroom lives to go. You can post your score in the high score board.\n\n\nBUT... THERE'S NO INTERNET CONNECTION IN THE WOODS!\n\nNo worries, you only require connectivity for the initial installation and for installing updates so you can always use new features.\n\n\nLANGUAGES\n\nThe complete app is available in German, English, French and Spanish. Species names are available in many other languages, try the LITE version.   \n\n\nSEARCH AND IDENTIFY SPECIES BY\n\n* APPEARANCE AND SCENT\n- size, color, hat, gills, stem, etc.\n* EDIBILITY AND TASTE\n- toxic, edible, allergen, etc.\n* FRUIT BODY TYPE\n- belly mushrooms, gilled mushrooms, truffle, etc.\n* HABITAT\n- deciduous or coniferous forest floor, etc.\n* FAMILY\n- Agaricaceae, Boletaceae, Clathraceae, etc.\n* MEDICINAL BENEFIT AND POISON\n- antibiotic, Psilocybin, Muscarin, etc.\n\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP IDENTIFICATION\n\n* sophisticated questions will guide you to the species you discovered\n* easy identification step by step\n* questions and content conceived by Dr. Gerhardt, member of the German Mycological Society\n\n\nTRAIN YOUR KNOWLEDGE with a QUIZ GAME\n\n* Guess species from pictures\n* Learn to distinguish the different species\n* Become an expert in mycology\n\n\nFollow NATURE MOBILE on Twitter https://twitter.com/NatureMobile, look for us on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/NatureMobile), or visit our website www.NatureMobile.org.\n\n\nSUBMIT YOUR PICTURES AND STORY\n\nDo you want your pictures available to all in the app?\nPlease visit www.NatureMobile.org website to submit pictures.

And we obtain 5mg/l.\n5_ We write the dissolution data. For example, in a 1000ml of distilled water we added 20 grams of KNO3.\n6_ The app calculates that we should add 48.91 ml of the dissolution to raise the concentration to the level wanted.\n\n** Remember that the KNO3 (for N) and the KH2PO4 (for P),both contain K. So the K test should be done after the N and P fertilisers are added to the aquarium.\n\nLanguage: English / Español\n\nContact:\ndbrancam@gmail.com"

      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

Automatically note the current date, time, latitude, longitude and Grid Reference. The app includes iCloud syncing, so that if you have more than one device (iPhone, iPod or iPad) your sightings will automatically synchronise.\n\n\"I don't say this often, but you guys should charge more for this neat little piece of work!

      "label": "Warblr is an app that automatically recognises birds by their song. The way in which it works is simple – make a recording with your iPhone, and Warblr will identify the species of bird/s that can be found in that recording, providing you with images and descriptions to help you learn more about our feathered friends.\n\nIn using Warblr, you will be contributing to a citizen science project, and hopefully one day helping to protect endangered species. We will be making the recordings and the data collected on species identification freely available to be used for research and conservation.\n\nWarblr can recognise over 220 species of British bird, and works particularly well for garden and woodland species. Our technology uses the latest techniques in machine learning, and is supported by Queen Mary University of London.\n\n**Please note – if you’re having any issues using Warblr please just drop us a line to hello@warblr.net**\n\nFind us on:\ntwitter.com/WarblrUK\nfacebook.com/Warblr"

For the tree enthusiast, there is comprehensive anatomical and ecological information, with high quality images of every species.\n\nWhen you have identified a tree, why not record your sighting  using our mapping screen.

Who is looking for Allanite or Manganbabingtonite? \n\nFeatures of this App:\n   - View information and pictures of the most common collected rocks, gems, and minerals.\n\n   - Search by name and information to narrow your results to view.\n\n   - Add your own using pictures from your Photo Library. Enter name and description of your new addition and assign pictures from your Photo Library for the Icon and Pics pages. Once the pics are added from your Photo Library, they can be deleted, as the picture information is stored in the App.\n\n   - Tips section gives information about collecting as well as App specific information.\n\n   - Gallery section gives you the ability to showcase just the rocks you have. Organized by their pictures and sorted by their Name, Type, or Rating. Share them to others or save to your Photo Library.\n\n   - No internet connection needed. All data stored locally, so it is still usable in locations that may not be out of network range.\n\n    - No Ads or in-App purchases. Nothing else to buy.\n\nIf you have an iPhone, you may be interested in the app \"RockHound\", which contains GPS data of collection sites and what you will find there, along with this module for identification. The RockHound app will not work on the iPod Touch, since the GPS data is critical for its use."

Instead of trying to cram hundreds of pages of information into a cluttered and messy interface, I designed Vimmy to be a quick and easy to use companion for the average Vi/Vim user. The colorful interface is intuitive and simple, and is divided into easy to navigate categories like \"Moving Around\", \"Entering Text\", \"Search and Replace\", etc. If you see something you'd like added, email me and I'd be happy to accommodate your request."

      "label": "Psaltirea Ortodoxa  (cunoscută și sub numele de Psalmii lui David sau Cartea Psalmilor) este o carte din Vechiul Testament care conține imnuri și poeme atribuite în mod tradițional profetului și regelui David, strămoș al Domnului Iisus Hristos. Practic fiecare aspect al rugăciunii către Dumnezeu (sau al slujbei lui Dumnezeu) – lauda, mulțumirea, pocăința, mijlocirea – este acoperit în Psaltire. \n\nPsaltirea este atât de predominantă în rugăciunea și slujirea ortodoxă încât Sfântul Ioan Gură de Aur a spus că oriunde s-ar uita în Biserică, găsește Psaltirea ca fiind „prima, ultima și centrală”.\n\n\nCatismele\n\nPsaltirea este împărțită în 20 de catisme. Fiecare catismă este la rândul ei împărțită în trei stări. Fiecare stare conținând de obicei 1–3 capitole. Excepție face Psalmul 118. Datorită lungimii sale acest capitol constituie întreaga Catismă a XVII-a.\n\nFiecare sfântă slujbă conține părți fixe din Psaltire care sunt citite sau cântate de fiecare dată când se oficiază aceste slujbe. În plus, anumite slujbe ale Ceasurilor conțin anumite citiri rânduite de catisme. Acestea se rotesc zilnic astfel încât în afara Postului Paștelui Psaltirea să fie citită în întregime într-o săptămână.\n\nÎn timpul Sfântului și Marelui Post, citirea catismelor este grăbită astfel încât Psaltirea să fie citită în întregime de două ori într-o săptămână. \n\nDumnezeu sa va aibe in pază, Amin!"

Works perfectly.”\n\n****\nDownloaded & used by thousands of seafarers in the USA, Great Britain, Australia, France, Canada, New Zealand & over 50 other countries\n****\n\nThis boating, sailing and marine app provides all skippers, sailors, boaters and fishermen with the essential quick reference knowledge they need to quickly recognise and interpret the buoys and the light markers and improve your overall boating skills and safety on the water, as specified by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) Systems A & B.\n\nWhether out on the water or on shore, in daylight, darkness or poor visibility, simply open the app and search the buoys, beacons, markers and lights in seconds to find the appropriate rule and definition.\n\n- No internet connection required.\n- Simple, easy to use navigation for quick reference.\n- Every IALA buoyage marker available at the touch of a finger.\n- Expertly drawn illustrations accompanied by clear, concise descriptions\n\nIf you are responsible for a vessel at sea, no matter how small or large, you must be able to recognise different types of navigation marks, day or night, and know what they mean.\n\nThis Buoys & Lights app will help improve your overall boating skills and safety on the water.\n\nBuoys & Lights is designed to help all recreational and professional seafarers learn and understand the world buoyage systems which are organised by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA).\n\nThere are two systems in use, IALA A and IALA B and they are both explained fully in this app.\nThere are 4 main sections in this boating safety app:\n\n1. Buoyage: A graphic reference guide with 70 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of buoy, their uses, appearance, permutations and light characteristics.\n\n2. Lights: A graphic reference guide with 12 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of light and their characteristics, used by beacons and lighthouses.\n\n3. IALA Rules: The International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) rules are reproduced in full.\n\n4. Test Yourself: A series of multiple choice questions with 35 graphic representations of buoys and lights helps you check your knowledge.\n\nWe've worked hard to uphold the highest standards of accuracy in this app and want you to enjoy this app in several ways:\n- As an easy reference and revision tool \n- As a powerful visual aide-memoire \n- As an accurate source of safety information tested by marine experts \n- As a way to constantly improve your knowledge and recall via the 'test yourself\" section \n- As a tool to assist you on sailing and boating courses\n\nFEEDBACK & ENDORSEMENT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL BOATING COMMUNITY that we've had is perhaps the best indicator of the value of our apps:\n\n\"I was so impressed with your Nav Lights app that I bought it and downloaded it immediately.\"\n\"I really like the ColRegs part of it and the way you have kept it completely in line with the IRPCS.\"\n\nOTHER APPS IN THIS SERIES:\n- ColRegs: Lights and Shapes provides in depth covers ColRegs Rules 20 to 31 \n\n- ColRegs: The Rules of the Road covers the \"Steering and Sailing Rules\" and \"Sound and Light Signals\" sections of the IRPCS\n\nIn use around the world!"

The common mushroom, dearly loved treasure in many kitchens. But once it's found, fundamental doubts replace the initial euphoria. What kind of mushroom is this actually? Is it edible, perhaps toxic, even hallucinogenic? A mushroom identification manual would be useful now - but who likes to crawl through the undergrowth with a bulky book?!\n\n\nNATURE MOBILE has developed an app for all smartphone users that helps with identifying and collecting mushrooms - Mushrooms PRO. With more than *300* species and over *2000* high-resolution images it doesn't have to hide in the thicket. For each mushroom there is a comprehensive description and a selection of images of different perspectives and life tilt. Not only occasional collectors will have their fun with the app - mycologists will enjoy it, too, as the content of the app has been compiled by Dr. GERHARDT, author of many mushroom books and scientific publications about mycology. Dr. GERHARDT has been a long term employee and consultant of Mycology at the Botanical Gardens and in the Botanical Museum of Berlin.\n\n\nSO HOW CAN A MUSHROOM BE IDENTIFIED?\n\nYou can choose from a variety of visual and other characteristic features and thus reduce the list of eligible mushroom species.\n\n\nYOUR PERSONAL TRAINER!\n\n* Learning* with a picture quiz. Polyporus Brumalis, Echinoderma Asperum or rather Armillaria Ostoyae? In case you don't know the right answer to a question, you still have 2 more mushroom lives to go. You can post your score in the high score board.\n\n\nBUT... THERE'S NO INTERNET CONNECTION IN THE WOODS!\n\nNo worries, you only require connectivity for the initial installation and for installing updates so you can always use new features.\n\n\nLANGUAGES\n\nThe complete app is available in German, English, French and Spanish. Species names are available in many other languages, try the LITE version.   \n\n\nSEARCH AND IDENTIFY SPECIES BY\n\n* APPEARANCE AND SCENT\n- size, color, hat, gills, stem, etc.\n* EDIBILITY AND TASTE\n- toxic, edible, allergen, etc.\n* FRUIT BODY TYPE\n- belly mushrooms, gilled mushrooms, truffle, etc.\n* HABITAT\n- deciduous or coniferous forest floor, etc.\n* FAMILY\n- Agaricaceae, Boletaceae, Clathraceae, etc.\n* MEDICINAL BENEFIT AND POISON\n- antibiotic, Psilocybin, Muscarin, etc.\n\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP IDENTIFICATION\n\n* sophisticated questions will guide you to the species you discovered\n* easy identification step by step\n* questions and content conceived by Dr. Gerhardt, member of the German Mycological Society\n\n\nTRAIN YOUR KNOWLEDGE with a QUIZ GAME\n\n* Guess species from pictures\n* Learn to distinguish the different species\n* Become an expert in mycology\n\n\nFollow NATURE MOBILE on Twitter https://twitter.com/NatureMobile, look for us on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/NatureMobile), or visit our website www.NatureMobile.org.\n\n\nSUBMIT YOUR PICTURES AND STORY\n\nDo you want your pictures available to all in the app?\nPlease visit www.NatureMobile.org website to submit pictures.

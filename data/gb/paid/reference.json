Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

      "label": "THE PREMIER IPAD ATLAS - with RETINA VECTOR MAPS\n\nThe World HD is unique in the app store because it includes both a complete set of country maps AND the largest world fact book.  These enable it to answer questions which Atlases and fact books cannot:  Atlases show you where countries are located, but have very little information about them; fact books tell you about each country, but their maps leave you guessing about where places are located.\n\n\n___________ HOW IT WORKS ___________\n\nThe interface is animated and interactive.  Touch a country on the world map and the Retina vector country map opens while the factbook slides onto the screen, each topic neatly organized as tiles along the edge of the map.  Touch a factbook tile and it zooms out to reveal detailed information about that topic.  Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the drop-down list and The World HD zooms in on it then opens the map and factbook.\n\nThe zoomable world map is not just the fastest way to select a country it also enables you to visualize and understand entire regions.  It is so intuitive and easy to explore that once you get started it's hard to stop!\n\n\n___________ FEATURES ___________\n\nRETINA VECTOR MAPS\n** Includes high-resolution Retina vector maps for EVERY COUNTRY built-in!  Unlike the other atlases, these maps remain in focus at all magnifications so you can easily see even the smallest detail.  These aren't the CIA maps found in the factbooks, they are used in printed atlases.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n** Contains geopolitical and demographic information on 300 countries and regions.\n\nNO INTERNET CONNECTION is required\n** Except for live Wikipedia content, all data and maps are built-in\n\nINNOVATIVE FACT BOOK PANEL\n** Presents each section of the fact book as tiles enabling you to quickly find what you need, while keeping the country map in view.\n\nHIGHLY ANIMATED INTERFACE\n** Responds to your touches and gestures so you can quickly find the information you are looking for.\n\nCIA WORLD FACTBOOK\n** This trusted source of current country information is built-in for every country, including sections on: introduction, geography, people, economy, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues.\n\nWIKIPEDIA\n** View the live, community-written Wikipedia content for each country, island, and remote region within the app.\n\nSHOWS YOU where countries are located\n** Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the country list and The World zooms to it on the world map and opens the Fact Book Panel\n\nDESIGNED FOR YOUR IPAD & IPHONE\n** Thoughtfully uses the whole screen to present maps and data"

      "label": "The essential guide to birds in Patagonia for eager birders or curious tourists! What makes this app unique is the step-by-step search function on the basis of what you see, helping to identify the bird you have just spotted. Each species is accompanied with a map of its distribution, a textual description, photographs and conservation status, together with order, family and Latin name. The Chilean and Argentinian names are given for each bird, and all the texts are in English, Spanish and Italian.\nAn ideal app for experts and simple tourists alike: birds in Patagonia are far less shy than in Europe or North America, so you can get much closer!\n\nDESCRIPTION\nOur aim has not been to produce a comprehensive, technical birdwatching field guide for the expert birdwatcher, but a selection of the most representative and fascinating birds of Patagonia.\nOur guide aims to be of interest and use to a broader and less expert public, as well as to the keen birdwatcher.\nThere are clear photographs of each species of bird, together with a distribution map and non-technical descriptive text.\nWith regard to seabirds, we have included only those that may be seen on or near the coast. In a guide intended for visitors to Patagonia, there seemed little point including pelagic birds that may be Argentinian or Chilean in the sense that they cross the waters of these countries, but are rarely or never actually seen in Patagonia itself.\n\nHOW TO USE THIS APP\nYou can choose to see the birds listed alphabetically or select them by name, family or order.\nA search facility helps you identify the bird you have spotted.\nSimply tap in the details you have noted about its appearance and behaviour and the app will show you the possible bird(s) matching those criteria, in order of probability.\nTap on the name to see a description of that bird and its conservation status.\nTap on the world symbol for a map of its range.\nTap on the thumbnail to show the photographs of the bird described.\nTapping on the habitat button on the top-level menu provides a description of the main habitats of Patagonia, together with photographs."

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

Have fun with fungi!\n\nThe app covers a wide range of fungi, from mushrooms and toadstools to bracket fungi, puffballs, and other strange wild fungi, with a range of photos and detailed information on appearance, habitat, edibility and more. It is British-made and is the only mushroom app using recognised English names (as specified by the British Mycological Society).\n\nA ‘Fungus Finder’ is included to identify mystery fungi. This feature has been carefully designed to require no specialist knowledge so even if you are a complete beginner, you will be able to put a name to your discovery. \n\nIcons indicate whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous, or to be avoided because it is unpleasant, but remember to check with an expert before eating any wild fungus.\n\nOnce identified, you can mark the fungus as seen, make notes about it, add your own photos, and automatically check the current date, time, latitude, longitude and Grid Reference. \n\nThe app includes iCloud syncing, so that if you have more than one device (iPhone, iPod or iPad) your sightings will automatically synchronise.\n\n\n\n========= About us =========\n\nWe have been making nature apps since the App Store started in 2008, and have a range of popular bird, bird song, and butterfly apps for all iOS devices - iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad & Apple Watch.

It is an invaluable resource written when American values and patriotism were based on Christian values.\n\nOf interest to poets and writers, The Noah Webster dictionary was used extensively by Emily Dickinson. We know that she made frequent and extensive use of Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language in writing her poems, paying attention not only to the definitions but also to Webster's etymologies and his illustrative quotations.\n\nBeing able to see how definitions have evolved today is fascinating, and a great resource when studying.\n\nYou can easily search or browse the entire dictionary and add favourites to revisit later.\n\nApp design by professional app developer NASDA Studios."

You can double tap on the labels to get more information about a particular feature.\n\nJupiter Atlas displays the approximate phase, axial tilt and central meridian of the selected moon from your chosen location and time, and renders these on the globe. You can switch to a 'Globe' mode that allows you to spin the moon around to see the whole globe. The feature database is searchable and can move the globe to a searched feature. The phase can be switched off to show the whole globe more clearly.\n\nThe moon's globe can be shown with north or south at the top or inverted to suit different telescope views.\n\nOver 680 named features across four moons are included. These moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.\n\nThe phase view shows the current view of Jupiter itself including the position of the Great Red Spot and the approximate axial tilt and central meridian. You can swipe left and right on the phase view to go backwards and forwards a day. When you turn the device to landscape mode a wider view is shown with the Galilean moons in their approximate positions for the time selected.\n\nDate, time and location can be changed.

Their importance was emphasized by the 17th century herbalists, as well as by contemporary practitioners.\n\nIn the latest version, a possibility to generate a notification when a particular hour starts was added. \n\nIf you want to learn more about the planetary hours, I've prepared for you a course, Planetary Hours: A Complete Guide (https://astroschool.lunarium.co.uk/p/planetary-hours-a-complete-guide)"

Works perfectly.”\n\n****\nDownloaded & used by thousands of seafarers in the USA, Great Britain, Australia, France, Canada, New Zealand & over 50 other countries\n****\n\nThis boating, sailing and marine app provides all skippers, sailors, boaters and fishermen with the essential quick reference knowledge they need to quickly recognise and interpret the buoys and the light markers and improve your overall boating skills and safety on the water, as specified by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) Systems A & B.\n\nWhether out on the water or on shore, in daylight, darkness or poor visibility, simply open the app and search the buoys, beacons, markers and lights in seconds to find the appropriate rule and definition.\n\n- No internet connection required.\n- Simple, easy to use navigation for quick reference.\n- Every IALA buoyage marker available at the touch of a finger.\n- Expertly drawn illustrations accompanied by clear, concise descriptions\n\nIf you are responsible for a vessel at sea, no matter how small or large, you must be able to recognise different types of navigation marks, day or night, and know what they mean.\n\nThis Buoys & Lights app will help improve your overall boating skills and safety on the water.\n\nBuoys & Lights is designed to help all recreational and professional seafarers learn and understand the world buoyage systems which are organised by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA).\n\nThere are two systems in use, IALA A and IALA B and they are both explained fully in this app.\nThere are 4 main sections in this boating safety app:\n\n1. Buoyage: A graphic reference guide with 70 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of buoy, their uses, appearance, permutations and light characteristics.\n\n2. Lights: A graphic reference guide with 12 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of light and their characteristics, used by beacons and lighthouses.\n\n3. IALA Rules: The International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) rules are reproduced in full.\n\n4. Test Yourself: A series of multiple choice questions with 35 graphic representations of buoys and lights helps you check your knowledge.\n\nWe've worked hard to uphold the highest standards of accuracy in this app and want you to enjoy this app in several ways:\n- As an easy reference and revision tool \n- As a powerful visual aide-memoire \n- As an accurate source of safety information tested by marine experts \n- As a way to constantly improve your knowledge and recall via the 'test yourself\" section \n- As a tool to assist you on sailing and boating courses\n\nFEEDBACK & ENDORSEMENT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL BOATING COMMUNITY that we've had is perhaps the best indicator of the value of our apps:\n\n\"I was so impressed with your Nav Lights app that I bought it and downloaded it immediately.\"\n\"I really like the ColRegs part of it and the way you have kept it completely in line with the IRPCS.\"\n\nOTHER APPS IN THIS SERIES:\n- ColRegs: Lights and Shapes provides in depth covers ColRegs Rules 20 to 31 \n\n- ColRegs: The Rules of the Road covers the \"Steering and Sailing Rules\" and \"Sound and Light Signals\" sections of the IRPCS\n\nIn use around the world!"

With this app for iPhone and iPad, you can now recolour the objects in your photos with any RAL colour – quickly and easily.\nIn only three steps, anything can be recoloured with RAL iCOLOURS:\n\n1.Take a photo with your iPhone.\n2.Select one of 2,328 RAL colours.\n3.Recolour the object in the photo.\n\nRAL iCOLOURS is as useful as it is inspiring. Painters, architects, graphic designers and Web designers can now make it easier for their customers to make colour decisions. With the RAL Colours app, you can quickly give them a picture of your colour concept. You can present colour designs to your customers on site and display alternatives directly. And you can save your colour selection by project name and send photos of recoloured objects via email.\n\nThe app’s colour palette includes the RAL CLASSIC and RAL EFFECT colour collections and all of the colours in the RAL DESIGN System – all 2,328 RAL colours. The corresponding L*a*b*, sRGB, CMYK and LRV values are listed for each colour. And RAL iCOLOURS is also compatible with COLORCATCH NANO, the Colorix colorimeter. This device incorporates a revolutionary new technology to accurately measure the color of smooth, structured or patterned surfaces to determine the corresponding color of the preselected swatch. NANO reads and measures 50'000 pixels separately. During reading it eliminates automatically all non-dominant colors such as shade effects and dirty surfaces.\n\nFor better understanding of the functions and use of the App, please watch the demo on the video first.\nLink to video: https://www.ral-farben.de/iphone-app-icolours.html?&L=1\n\nThe colour values enable the user to make a visual choice of RAL colours. Only the primary standards of RAL CLASSIC, RAL DESIGN and RAL EFFECT shall be used for the preparation and control of RAL colours.\n\nRAL is a registered trade mark of RAL gGmbH. The presentation of the RAL colours is based on a licence granted by RAL gGmbH.

Setting the highest standards of reliability and readability, the NIV is ideal for personal reading, public teaching and group study. \nRoyalties from all sales of the NIV help Biblica in their work of translating and distributing Bibles around the world.\n\nThis Anglicised NIV Bible in One Year app has been developed in the UK by Aimer Media in collaboration with Hodder & Stoughton. Due to the terms of Hodder’s NIV license, the app cannot be purchased in the USA or Canada.

      "label": "A great resource for those who want to go back and forth between Maya and Christian Calendar dates.  No internet connection needed, so it can be in your pocket as you travel through Maya ruins and use it to calculate the Gregorian calendar dates from Maya long counts on monuments.\n\nMaya Calendar gives you the Maya calendar date for today or any date in history – past, present, and future.  Convert dates back and forth between the Maya and Gregorian calendars, learn about the various Maya cycles of time, and gain a better understanding of why December 21, 2012 A.D. is an important Maya date.\n\nIn addition, this app can calculate your birthday in the Maya sacred calendar and learn what it says about your personality traits and destiny.\n\nMaya Calendar offers these great features:\n\n– The Home Page displays the current day in the Maya Calendar, both in hieroglyphs and in modern text formats.\n\n– “This Day in Maya History” cites a major event in Maya history for almost every day of the year.\n\n–  The “Maya Calendars” section provides a detailed explanation of each of the major Maya calendrical cycles, a discussion of the calendar correlation debate, and the thinking behind the possible end date of 2012 A.D.\n\n– The “Calculator” allows you to convert any Gregorian date into its Maya calendar equivalent.\n\n– The “Long Count” feature allows you to convert any Maya Long Count date into its Gregorian calendar equivalent. \n\n– The “Birthdays” feature allows you to calculate and store the Maya birthdays of everyone you know. Once calculated, the app provides a host of information about that individual: personality traits; animal, color, and directional associations; and events in Maya history that occurred on the same date as their birth.\n\n– The “Known Birthdays” feature lists and saves the names of everyone whose Maya birthday you have recorded and notifies you when their birthday comes around.\n\n– “What to Do Today” lists the activities that modern Maya calendar priests recommend for any given day.\n\nMaya Calendar, created by Dr. Ed Barnhart, is an invaluable tool for students investigating Maya inscriptions, and for anyone fascinated with the workings of the Maya calendar."

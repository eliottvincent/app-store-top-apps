      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

A short description and helpful tips are given for each song or call, as well as a photo of each bird. Birds can be sorted by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to rarer species. Or sort by song style, so that you can compare birds that hoot and coo, or those with high pitched songs for example. You can also sort by name, habitat or bird group.\n\nAfter listening, try the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nThe slideshow section can be used as a way to relax, or switch the voiceover on and see if you can say the name of the bird before the voiceover. This is a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?! \n\nIncludes birds from Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Italy."

      "label": "The original and the best, accept no cheap imitations ! \nRecord a bird singing and use Automatic Recognition to help identify it. Unlike all other apps, no internet or mobile connection is needed.\n\n•   The Times Newspaper said the app \"Does what it says on the \n\ntin\" and were amazed that \"this astonishing piece of software \ncosts about the same as a cup of coffee\".\n\n•   \"In direct comparison Bird Song Id showed better results than Chirpomatic\". - naturschutz.ch - Swiss Birding Magazine \n\nCopied by a few, bettered by none, Bird Song Id is three years  \nahead of anyone else in this field !\n\n•   The Telegraph Newspaper said \"Bird Song Id is a good walk improved, and may even put a spring in your step\".\n\n•   over 1000 good ratings\n\nAutomatic Recognition takes place on the device, no connection to the internet or mobile network is needed.\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs good quality recordings to work. See the HELP below, or follow the Developer Website link to find out how to improve your recordings.\n\nAutomatic Recognition will help identify a good cross section of bird song in the British Isles, but you will need a good quality recording. Lots of blue and green peaks reaching to the top of the analysis graph is a good indication of a quality recording. Help and examples are included in the app to guide you.\n\nHow successful is it ? Our aim is to get the correct bird in the top three of those listed. In our testing of over 1,000 samples we found the success rate to be 85%.\n\nFollow the Developer Website link to see a demo of Automatic Recognition on YouTube\n\n--------------- HELP ----------------\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs a good quality recording of the bird.\n-------------\nOnly record when a single bird is singing, or when a single bird is dominant\n-------------\nThe analysis graph should have plenty of blue and green colors with few or no black peaks.\n-------------\nThe peaks on the graph should reach all the way to the top. Low peaks indicate poor quality and recognition is unlikely.\n-------------\nThe Audio Quality, shown at the top of the results screen, should be at least Good, and preferably Very Good or Excellent\n-------------\nThe highest score should be above 70% to be useful. Below this and the system is telling you it is not sure what the song is.\n-------------\nA difference between two birds of less than 10% is not that significant, so listen to the samples from both to help you further\n-------------\nSee the samples for how the analysis graph should look (to see the samples press the sample button at the top right of the help page)\n-------------\nMake sure it is very quiet apart from the bird song which should be nice and loud\n-------------\nBe as close to the bird as you can be without disturbing it\n-------------\nBe patient, dont expect miracles, the system works but needs good clear recordings\n-------------\nThe microphone is at the bottom of an iPhone, point the bottom of the phone towards the bird\n-------------\nRemove the case from your iPhone if you use one as this can dampen the microphone\n-------------\nRecord a single bird at a time\n-------------\nCapture at least two singing episodes if you can. \n-------------\nRecord for the full 30 seconds\n-------------\nAvoid windy conditions. Air moving over the microphone will mask the bird sounds\n-------------\nMake sure there is plenty of life in the battery. Your device will reduce power going to the microphone as the battery runs down\n-------------\nPlaying songs to the app from recorded material on the internet, other apps or CDs is unlikely to work as this material is digitally processed and edited (inter phase gaps are often shortened). They sound very different to recording birds for real on an iPhone or iPad in the natural environment. Its a bit like putting rocket fuel in a lawn mower.\n-------------"

Probably the most advanced and complete portrait of London ever produced, it offers an indispensable reference to the 2000-year history of the world’s most complex city.  It boasts over 6000 articles on the capital’s museums, statues, buildings, streets, trades, people, parks, rivers and more.  Over 2000 rare prints and photographs.  Thirty-five video documentaries and clips from the archives of the Pathé movie library. \n\nHistoric panoramas of the city from the 17th Century to the 19th Century - all viewable as high-definition zoomable images, plus 70 gyro-controlled 360º views of the capital’s grandest sites.  There are wonderfully detailed spinable artefacts from the Museum of London.  It has audio tours to the haunts and hideaways of robbers and royalty from London’s official Blue Badge guides, and a unique history by tube stop section to let you know what’s above ground when your under it.  Linking everything is a synchronised time-line to help navigate with unprecedented ease through every aspect of London’s deep and amazing history."

It is based on the 2010 commemorative edition of Newman’s Birds of Southern Africa, one of the most popular birding guides in the region since its initial publication in 1983. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFREE VERSION:\nTry before you buy – there is a free lite version with full app functionality, limited to 60 species, so that you can see how it works before purchasing this app. Search for Newman's Birds of Southern Africa LITE.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING THE LIFE LIST: \nThis app includes a cloud-based life list that stores your sightings online. You need to log in to the life list while you have internet connectivity, but once logged in, you can add sightings when you don’t have an internet connection. When you next connect to the internet, the life list will sync, and your new entries should be added to your list. The life list will sync to all your devices that have the app installed and where you are logged in with the same details."

The first pre-production aircraft, built for flight testing, the BAC/Aerospatiale Concorde 101 G-AXDN is part of the British Airliner Collection owned and preserved by the Duxford Aviation Society (DAS).\nPerfect for plane enthusiasts or those simply curious, explore high quality 360° images inside the whole length of the aircraft, including an exclusive and highly detailed view inside of the cockpit which is not usually open to the public, watch informative videos, navigate detailed instrument information and explore systems used on-board such as the Ice Station used to monitor ice build up on the outside of the plane. Highlights include videos of the nose being lowered, how the observers station was used by the engineers plus 101's final landing at Duxford in 1977.\nOnce downloaded, no internet connection is required to run the app or play the videos contained within. Download it today to experience an exciting insight into an aviation icon, a historical marvel of the modern age. Explore the technical innovation that enabled airline passengers to enjoy supersonic flights from 1976 until Concorde's eventual retirement in 2003. 101 is the British pre-production version of Concorde and the third Concorde built, with the interior of the aircraft fitted out with various testing equipment and instruments rather than the commercial seating layout.\nIf you wish to discover more, you can visit the BAC/Aerospatiale Concorde 101 G-AXDN which is normally open to the public 7 days a week between 10am - 3pm on normal museum opening days, and is positioned inside the AirSpace building at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford."

      "label": "Warblr is an app that automatically recognises birds by their song. The way in which it works is simple – make a recording with your iPhone, and Warblr will identify the species of bird/s that can be found in that recording, providing you with images and descriptions to help you learn more about our feathered friends.\n\nIn using Warblr, you will be contributing to a citizen science project, and hopefully one day helping to protect endangered species. We will be making the recordings and the data collected on species identification freely available to be used for research and conservation.\n\nWarblr can recognise over 220 species of British bird, and works particularly well for garden and woodland species. Our technology uses the latest techniques in machine learning, and is supported by Queen Mary University of London.\n\n**Please note – if you’re having any issues using Warblr please just drop us a line to hello@warblr.net**\n\nFind us on:\ntwitter.com/WarblrUK\nfacebook.com/Warblr"

No skill or knowledge of birds required.\n    • The app includes a reference section with bird sounds, descriptions of the sounds, and photos\n    • Share your recordings with friends using WhatsApp, Messages, Airdrop or Email\n    • ChirpOMatic respects your privacy. You don’t need an account, and your recordings are for you alone. We only hear your recordings if you choose to send them to us\n    • We listen to the recordings that are sent to us and the best ones are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird sound research\n    • If you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later\n    • Thanks to ‘bird-safe’ mode, ChirpOMatic is the only bird app that can be used anywhere at any time without risk of disturbing nesting birds\n\n\nHOW TO USE CHIRPOMATIC\n    • When you hear a bird, hold up your phone and tap the red button to start recording\n    • Record for up to 10 seconds, then wait a few moments for the result\n    • You will be shown details of the bird that was singing\n    • Compare your recording with the reference samples and description to check the identification\n    • If you don't have a data connection, then the sound is saved for analysis later\n\n\"Chirp-o-magic!

Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB.

It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

Whether you are refreshing your knowledge for recurrent training or studying hard for the initial Type Rating Exam, this app will complement your study program to ensure that your level of technical knowledge is as high as possible.\n\nWritten by an experienced Training Captain with thousands of hours on the 757 and 767, B757 / 767 Exam Questions includes a database of over 350 questions.  Each question is of a similar style and layout to the type of question you can expect to see on a Type Rating Exam.  Each question has a choice of three answers, and any questions that are answered incorrectly are automatically transferred to a \"review\" bank of questions which can be re-tested at your convenience.  A brief explanation accompanies most questions, where appropriate, to assist you in your understanding of the accompanying system.   Both metric and imperial measurements are included to ensure that this app is relevant to all 757 / 767 pilots no matter where in the world you happen to be.  \n\nQuestions can be attempted either on an individual system basis, or all at once.  Your score is tallied and presented to you at the end, so you will have a good idea of how effective your study program is."

      "label": "In The Birds of Brazil all species of birds regularly found in Brazil (>1,700) are described, and their approximate size given in inches and tenths of inches.\n\nA brief account of each family is given in the list of families. The range of each species is described in detail (instead of range maps). In addition to the birds‘ geographical ranges, the altitudinal zones which they inhabit are given. The zones and their limits are:\n\n• Tropical Zone:\n  sea level to 4500–5000 ft (1,400 to 1,500 m)\n  \n• Subtropical Zone:\n  4500–5000 to 7500–8500 ft (1,400–1,500 m to 2,300–2,600 m)\n  \n• Temperate Zone:\n  7500–8500 to 9500–11,500 ft (2,300–2,600 m to 2,900–3,500 m)\n  \n• Páramo or Puna Zone:\n  9500–11,500 ft (2,900–3,500 m) to snow line \n\nThe current app version contains the descriptions and images of 1,700+ bird species found in Brazil. Moreover, an ornithological dictionary (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese) and detailed illustrations and drawings of bird anatomy are included.\n\nThe app features a modern, intuitive graphical user interface with functions for searching the birds‘ names and in the full text, switching the sorting language for the listings and sort by English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or the scientific (Latin) notation. In addition to the bird descriptions, the name of the birds in many languages can be displayed.\n\nAnother clever feature is the Field Note Editor, which allows you to record your bird sightings with predefined locations settings (which can be overwritten by the user) and many other commonly recorded data items.\n\nApart from using the optional backup and restore functions for Field Notes and Favorites, the app runs completely offline and there is no need for an internet connection during usage in the field.\n\nAs with The Birds of South America, which contains more than 3,000 birds found on the entire continent, also The Birds of Brazil runs on any iOS device and can exchange Field Notes and Favorites list between identical app versions on two or more devices via Bluetooth."

God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

The guide has been created by professional published ecologists, accept no cheap imitations!\n\nAll native British tree species are covered. Naturalised species are covered too. \n\nTreeId was one of BBC Countryfile's top 10 apps and described as \"incredibly useful\" by ITV's Seth Conway and \"a lovely app\" by Adam Vaughan of the Guardian. It was voted No. 5 in the Guardian Green Living top 10 apps and was given the  \"Best\" award by iPhone Apps Plus.\n\nHave you ever been on a walk in the countryside during the winter months  and wondered \"What tree is that?\". WinterTreeId is a great tool to help you  identify trees during the winter months when the tree may have no leaves, flowers or fruits to go on. Its great fun to use too. With WinterTreeId, identification can be enjoyed by the whole family, and can engage children with the natural world around them. For the tree enthusiast, there is comprehensive anatomical and ecological information, with high quality images of every species.\n\nWhen you have identified a tree, why not record your sighting  using our mapping screen. You can share your sighting with all other users too if you like. See how many species you can identify this winter!\n\nThere is a great quiz that really improves your id skills. Compete to be our highest scorer!\n\nThe app does not need an internet connection, all content is downloaded when the app is purchased.\n\nSUNBIRD IMAGES field guides are the only products on the market that use the KUSAM species identification methodology. This state of the art method is a modern taxonomic keying system designed specifically for use on mobile devices."

Perform an automatic calculation where the circuit is sized automatically or enter fixed sizes to run a calculation check on an existing design. Created for electrical engineers, electricians and designers. Suitable for Industrial, Commercial or Domestic Low Voltage Circuits.\n\nSimple, fast and reliable. 17th edition cable sizer performs cable Calculation for AC circuits in line with British Standard 7671:2008(2011) IEE Wiring regulations, without having to lookup the relevant tables.\n\nSimply enter the circuit parameters, hit calculate, and 17th edition cable sizer does the work for you by selecting the correct cable based on current carrying capacity, earth loop impedance and voltage drop. If you want to change a parameter, go back and modify it, then re-calculate to see the difference.\n\nAlternatively set the cable size and number of conductors in parallel and perform a calculation to check an existing design.\n\nResults are presented in a simple format with all rating factors given, which can then be sent by email.\nAll rating factors are considered, all installation methods available, power factor and conductor operating temperatures are incorporated into the calculation. Parallel cables are supported automatically if current exceeds maximum available for cable type.\n\nR1+R2, Zs and Fault currents are calculated and displayed. Automatic checks of Zs are performed for MCB's, RCBO's and BS3036 fuses.\n\nThe adiabatic calculation is also performed for applicable cable types with the ability to choose either armouring or separate CPC type. This provides circuit disconnection times based on the minimum fault current for BS88, BS1361 and BS3036 fuses.\n\nTypical external earth loop impedances can be used based on public supply type or transformer size.\n\nThe following cables are supported (in every available size):\n\nBS6724 Single Core and Multicore Armoured XLPE Copper/Aluminium\nBS5467 Single Core and Multicore Armoured PVC Copper/Aluminium\nFlat Twin and earth XLPE\nFlat Twin and earth PVC\n6491B Single core XLPE Copper/Aluminium\n6491X Single core PVC Copper/Aluminium\n\nThe following protective devices can be used:\n\nBS EN 60898 MCB Types B, C and D\nBS EN 60947-2 MCCB\nBS EN 61009-1 RCBO 30mA\nBS 88 HRC Fuses\nBS 3036 Rewireable Fuse\nBS 1361 Cartridge Fuse\n\nAll the data is stored locally on the phone so no Internet connection is ever required.\n\nIf you like this app, please rate it. Also if you find any issues or have any suggestions for new features, please get in touch.\n\nAlso see our other free app, Cable Installer, for cable, cleats and gland sizes."

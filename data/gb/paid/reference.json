Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

      "label": "The Lost Person Behavior App is based upon the Search and Rescue (SAR) international gold standard reference tool on where to look for lost and missing persons. Every Public Safety Official needs to know where the missing person might be, what to ask, where to look, and what to do when minutes matter. The app was built around the field needs of Public Safety Officials.  No matter how remote the location, the app continues to function since no network connection is required, once installed.\n\nThis life-saving information is customized for 41 different subject categories. The categories are organized into a hierarchy of groups including external factors (abductions, aircraft), water incidents (boats and persons in the water), wheeled incidents (ATV, mountain bikes, vehicles, etc.), mental states (autism, dementia, despondent, intellectual disability, mental illness, substance intoxication), children (in five different age groups), and eighteen outdoor activities (hiker, hunter, climber, gatherer, skier, etc.).\n\nThe app guides the user in selecting the correct subject category by several means. The subject category wizard allows the user to select potential scenarios and then will suggest the best match for the subject category.  For example, if a child was riding his bicycle and was then known to be abducted, the user could select Child, Wheel/Motorized, and Abduction; the wizard would suggest using the abduction category. Alternately, the user can go straight to a subject category by using favorites, an alphabetical list, or the hierarchy list. Once the subject category is selected, the Lost Person Behavior App provides the user with: \n•\tbehavioral profiles\n•\ttactical briefings\n•\tspecific investigative questions\n•\tspatial and survival statistics\n•\tsuggestions for initial tasks (reflex tasking).\n\nThe all-new tactical briefings distill the statistics and profiles to the key points that every field searcher must know. The more extensive profile, full statistics, and suggested initial tasks assist even the seasoned search planner. The highly detailed questions for the investigation resulted from decades of SAR experience and thousands of missions.\n\nThe app even allows you to email a checklist of these critical tasks and interview questions so that you may print them out.  The email could also be used for providing remote support or documenting tasks that have been completed.\n\nDetermining where to look is one of the major functions of the search statistics, which are now provided in a graphical and tabular format.  The statistics from thousands of SAR missions allow the search planner to see where similar previous search subjects were found. The SAR statistics include:\n•\tDistance from the Initial Planning Point\n•\tElevation model (likelihood of going up, down, or staying at the same elevation)\n•\tMobility model (how long will the subject keep moving)\n•\tDispersion angle (given a direction of travel, how well does that predict subject’s location)\n•\tTrack Offset model (how far away from a feature such as a road or trail is subject found)\n•\tFind location (at what type of geographic feature was the subject found)\n•\tScenario (what caused the subject to become missing)\n•\tSurvivability overall (what is the overall chance of finding the subject alive or injured)\n•\tSurvivability rate (how does survivability rate change in 24-hour increments).\n\nThe Lost Person Behavior App can be easily customized to only show the statistical information you actually need. The user can customize for ecoregion, terrain, and urban incidents. The user can view the data in both metric and English units. Several additional helpful tools are built into the app. Contextual help is provided on every page with additional information boxes, which explain every element of the app on the page you need.  The information page provides information about the bike wheel model used to describe initial tactical deployment (reflex tasking), a glossary, help, and contact information."

It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

We will be making the recordings and the data collected on species identification freely available to be used for research and conservation.\n\nWarblr can recognise over 220 species of British bird, and works particularly well for garden and woodland species.

      "label": "The original and the best, accept no cheap imitations ! \nRecord a bird singing and use Automatic Recognition to help identify it. Unlike all other apps, no internet or mobile connection is needed.\n\n•   The Times Newspaper said the app \"Does what it says on the \n\ntin\" and were amazed that \"this astonishing piece of software \ncosts about the same as a cup of coffee\".\n\n•   \"In direct comparison Bird Song Id showed better results than Chirpomatic\". - naturschutz.ch - Swiss Birding Magazine \n\nCopied by a few, bettered by none, Bird Song Id is three years  \nahead of anyone else in this field !\n\n•   The Telegraph Newspaper said \"Bird Song Id is a good walk improved, and may even put a spring in your step\".\n\n•   over 1000 good ratings\n\nAutomatic Recognition takes place on the device, no connection to the internet or mobile network is needed.\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs good quality recordings to work. See the HELP below, or follow the Developer Website link to find out how to improve your recordings.\n\nAutomatic Recognition will help identify a good cross section of bird song in the British Isles, but you will need a good quality recording. Lots of blue and green peaks reaching to the top of the analysis graph is a good indication of a quality recording. Help and examples are included in the app to guide you.\n\nHow successful is it ? Our aim is to get the correct bird in the top three of those listed. In our testing of over 1,000 samples we found the success rate to be 85%.\n\nFollow the Developer Website link to see a demo of Automatic Recognition on YouTube\n\n--------------- HELP ----------------\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs a good quality recording of the bird.\n-------------\nOnly record when a single bird is singing, or when a single bird is dominant\n-------------\nThe analysis graph should have plenty of blue and green colors with few or no black peaks.\n-------------\nThe peaks on the graph should reach all the way to the top. Low peaks indicate poor quality and recognition is unlikely.\n-------------\nThe Audio Quality, shown at the top of the results screen, should be at least Good, and preferably Very Good or Excellent\n-------------\nThe highest score should be above 70% to be useful. Below this and the system is telling you it is not sure what the song is.\n-------------\nA difference between two birds of less than 10% is not that significant, so listen to the samples from both to help you further\n-------------\nSee the samples for how the analysis graph should look (to see the samples press the sample button at the top right of the help page)\n-------------\nMake sure it is very quiet apart from the bird song which should be nice and loud\n-------------\nBe as close to the bird as you can be without disturbing it\n-------------\nBe patient, dont expect miracles, the system works but needs good clear recordings\n-------------\nThe microphone is at the bottom of an iPhone, point the bottom of the phone towards the bird\n-------------\nRemove the case from your iPhone if you use one as this can dampen the microphone\n-------------\nRecord a single bird at a time\n-------------\nCapture at least two singing episodes if you can. \n-------------\nRecord for the full 30 seconds\n-------------\nAvoid windy conditions. Air moving over the microphone will mask the bird sounds\n-------------\nMake sure there is plenty of life in the battery. Your device will reduce power going to the microphone as the battery runs down\n-------------\nPlaying songs to the app from recorded material on the internet, other apps or CDs is unlikely to work as this material is digitally processed and edited (inter phase gaps are often shortened). They sound very different to recording birds for real on an iPhone or iPad in the natural environment. Its a bit like putting rocket fuel in a lawn mower.\n-------------"

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

      "label": "There has never been an easier way to read the Bible in one year. Now, with the NIV Bible in One Year app from Hodder & Stoughton, you can both read it and listen to it on the move via your iOS device. \n\nThe NIV Audio Bible in One Year app includes the full text of the NIV Bible (British Text) and the award-winning audio narration by British actor, David Suchet. The Bible text is arranged into 365 manageable daily readings. Each day includes portions from the Psalms or Proverbs, and New and Old Testaments. \n\nThe app also includes a journalling feature in which you can make notes next to the text as you study and bookmark your favourite passages for easy reference. The app also allows you to share notes and Bible verses with friends and family or yourself by SMS (text), email, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nINSTALL NOTE: The price of this app includes the full 80 hours of audio for the NIV Bible read by David Suchet (which amounts to 1.3GB) but it does not automatically download when you purchase the app. Users can download each month’s audio content from within the app to suit their storage limitations. \n\nLISTEN TO THE BIBLE IN ONE YEAR\n- Listen to British actor David Suchet read his award-winning recording as you read the Bible in One Year or while multitasking.\n- Download all the audio at once, or one month at a time, depending on the space available on your device.\n- Follow the verses as they are narrated by selecting ‘Highlight verse with audio’. \n- Turn off the audio capability entirely if you wish to use the app for reading only. \n- Use the Sleep Timer to play the audio for a set number of minutes. \n- The NIV Audio Bible read by David Suchet won 'Bible of the Year' at the 2015 Christian Resources Together Awards.\n\nREAD THE NIV BIBLE IN ONE YEAR EVERYWHERE \n- The NIV Bible in One Year app is available on all iOS devices. \n- The app will automatically open on today’s reading. \n- Switch off ‘Always show today’s reading’ in the Settings menu. \n- Simple navigation: select any day of the year via ‘Find a Day’ in the main menu, or the scroller menu at the top of the screen. \n- Clear, readable layout: the Bible text matches the printed NIV 2011 Bibles. \n- Full Bible text included so no need for a network connection to use any of the app features. \n- Full-text keyword search allows you to find all entries for a particular word in the Bible. \n- Turn off toolbars to give you an uninterrupted reading experience. \n- Adjust text size and brightness to make reading more comfortable. \n\nJOURNALLING\n- Make notes next to the text as you study the Bible in One Year. \n- Bookmark your favourite passages for easy reference. \n- Notes and Bookmarks tabs list of all your entries so you can quickly jump to the one you want. \n- Share notes and verses with friends and family or yourself by SMS (text), email, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nNEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION\nWith over 400 million Bibles in print, the New International Version is the world’s most popular Bible in modern English. Setting the highest standards of reliability and readability, the NIV is ideal for personal reading, public teaching and group study. \nRoyalties from all sales of the NIV help Biblica in their work of translating and distributing Bibles around the world.\n\nThis Anglicised NIV Bible in One Year app has been developed in the UK by Aimer Media in collaboration with Hodder & Stoughton. Due to the terms of Hodder’s NIV license, the app cannot be purchased in the USA or Canada. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nDAVID SUCHET\nDavid Suchet CBE is an acclaimed British actor. He has enjoyed great success with the RSC and in London's West End. He is best known in television for his portrayal of Agatha Christie's detective Hercule Poirot. He is also a practising Anglican.

Identification can be enjoyed by the whole family.\n\nMushroom Id has been created by professional published ecologists, and uses images selected with the specific aim of aiding identification. Anatomical, ecological and taxonomic information is also included.\n\nMushroom Id can be used to keep a log of your fungi sightings making it easy to build a record of all the species you've seen. \n\nSUNBIRD apps appear in Countryfile's top 10, and have been described as \"incredibly useful\" by ITV's Seth Conway and \"lovely\" by Adam Vaughan of the Guardian.\n\nSUNBIRD field guides are the only products on the market that use the KUSAM species identification methodology. This state of the art method is a modern taxonomic keying system designed specifically for use on mobile devices.\n\nThe app does not need an internet connection, all content is downloaded when the app is purchased. We will be adding new species regularly. Don't forget to keep your app up to date.\n\nWe use the term 'Mushroom' to mean any type of fungi. Traditionally the term has been used only for Field Mushrooms by some, gilled fungi by others. There is no scientific limitation on the term and we have used it in this app for all types of fungi.\n\nThe app is intended for the general interest user with a love of the natural world. The app is not intended for use when foraging for wild foods and we strongly recommend you do not handle or eat wild mushrooms, many are extremely poisonous and easily misidentified. \n\nSunbird Images also develop apps for other companies see our website for details:\nhttp://sunbird.tv/de/sunbird-apps-ebooks/"

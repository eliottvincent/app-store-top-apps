      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

No skill or knowledge of birds required.\n    • The app includes a reference section with bird sounds, descriptions of the sounds, and photos\n    • Share your recordings with friends using WhatsApp, Messages, Airdrop or Email\n    • ChirpOMatic respects your privacy. You don’t need an account, and your recordings are for you alone. We only hear your recordings if you choose to send them to us\n    • We listen to the recordings that are sent to us and the best ones are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird sound research\n    • If you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later\n    • Thanks to ‘bird-safe’ mode, ChirpOMatic is the only bird app that can be used anywhere at any time without risk of disturbing nesting birds\n\n\nHOW TO USE CHIRPOMATIC\n    • When you hear a bird, hold up your phone and tap the red button to start recording\n    • Record for up to 10 seconds, then wait a few moments for the result\n    • You will be shown details of the bird that was singing\n    • Compare your recording with the reference samples and description to check the identification\n    • If you don't have a data connection, then the sound is saved for analysis later\n\n\"Chirp-o-magic!

A short description and helpful tips are given for each song or call, as well as a photo of each bird. Birds can be sorted by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to rarer species. Or sort by song style, so that you can compare birds that hoot and coo, or those with high pitched songs for example. You can also sort by name, habitat or bird group.\n\nAfter listening, try the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nThe slideshow section can be used as a way to relax, or switch the voiceover on and see if you can say the name of the bird before the voiceover. This is a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?! \n\nIncludes birds from Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Italy."

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

Those difficult words are finally given clarity with only a tap. What is the Strong's Concordance? The words in the Bible are numbered. Those numbers (Strong numbers) are tied to definitions (lexicons) from the original languages of the Bible. Sounds technical? Touch Bible makes this so easy:\n1. While you read the bible you'll see that most words are buttons.\n2. Tap on a word and you'll get so much information about the word. If you need to look up a word simply search for it (or it's number) and tap the link in the Bible reader.\n\nWhat resources are included in the Concordance?\n- Instant definitions include information from combined resources:\n+ \"Strong's Lexicons\" (Greek and Hebrew)\n+ \"Brown, Driver, Briggs Lexicon\" (BDB)\n+ \"Theological Word Book of the O.T.\" \n+ \"Thayer's and Smith's Bible Dictionary\"\n+ \"Kittel\"\n\n** List of Benefits **\n- Attach Images to your own notes (church bulletins, etc.).\n- Search for words or Strong numbers!\n- Study Articles - learn more with thousands of articles\n- Universal - works on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.\n- Dial a Verse : Touch Bible's way of looking up scripture FAST (See Screenshots)\n- Shake a Verse : Like flipping through the pages of a book to find a page to read.

Works perfectly.”\n\n****\nDownloaded & used by thousands of seafarers in the USA, Great Britain, Australia, France, Canada, New Zealand & over 50 other countries\n****\n\nThis boating, sailing and marine app provides all skippers, sailors, boaters and fishermen with the essential quick reference knowledge they need to quickly recognise and interpret the buoys and the light markers and improve your overall boating skills and safety on the water, as specified by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) Systems A & B.\n\nWhether out on the water or on shore, in daylight, darkness or poor visibility, simply open the app and search the buoys, beacons, markers and lights in seconds to find the appropriate rule and definition.\n\n- No internet connection required.\n- Simple, easy to use navigation for quick reference.\n- Every IALA buoyage marker available at the touch of a finger.\n- Expertly drawn illustrations accompanied by clear, concise descriptions\n\nIf you are responsible for a vessel at sea, no matter how small or large, you must be able to recognise different types of navigation marks, day or night, and know what they mean.\n\nThis Buoys & Lights app will help improve your overall boating skills and safety on the water.\n\nBuoys & Lights is designed to help all recreational and professional seafarers learn and understand the world buoyage systems which are organised by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA).\n\nThere are two systems in use, IALA A and IALA B and they are both explained fully in this app.\nThere are 4 main sections in this boating safety app:\n\n1. Buoyage: A graphic reference guide with 70 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of buoy, their uses, appearance, permutations and light characteristics.\n\n2. Lights: A graphic reference guide with 12 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of light and their characteristics, used by beacons and lighthouses.\n\n3. IALA Rules: The International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) rules are reproduced in full.\n\n4. Test Yourself: A series of multiple choice questions with 35 graphic representations of buoys and lights helps you check your knowledge.\n\nWe've worked hard to uphold the highest standards of accuracy in this app and want you to enjoy this app in several ways:\n- As an easy reference and revision tool \n- As a powerful visual aide-memoire \n- As an accurate source of safety information tested by marine experts \n- As a way to constantly improve your knowledge and recall via the 'test yourself\" section \n- As a tool to assist you on sailing and boating courses\n\nFEEDBACK & ENDORSEMENT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL BOATING COMMUNITY that we've had is perhaps the best indicator of the value of our apps:\n\n\"I was so impressed with your Nav Lights app that I bought it and downloaded it immediately.\"\n\"I really like the ColRegs part of it and the way you have kept it completely in line with the IRPCS.\"\n\nOTHER APPS IN THIS SERIES:\n- ColRegs: Lights and Shapes provides in depth covers ColRegs Rules 20 to 31 \n\n- ColRegs: The Rules of the Road covers the \"Steering and Sailing Rules\" and \"Sound and Light Signals\" sections of the IRPCS\n\nIn use around the world!"

      "label": "There’s something about knowing what creatures sniffed your tent in the night or walked along the path ahead of you. And yet, so often those signs are a mystery to us.\n\nWell they needn’t be. iTrack Southern Africa is an easy-to-use digital field guide that takes our communal knowledge of Southern African mammal tracks to another level altogether. It is accessible enough for those outdoor enthusiasts with nothing more than a casual interest in the footprints they come across and yet contains enough accurate and quantifiable information to be a powerful tool for hunters, researchers and expert trackers.\n\nIt breaks new ground in documenting the commonly used gait patterns of many Southern African mammals and makes use of over 2000 measurements to bring users never before published detail on track dimensions.\n\nSome of the key features of this app include:\n• Track and sign information for 61 Southern African mammal species (this number will continue to be added to in future updates).\n• Over 650 high quality track, sign, and animal photos with captions that point out key identification features.\n• Scale bars with precise measurements next to many track and sign photos.\n• Hoof, paw or foot photographs for a number species.\n• Photographs of commonly used gait patterns.\n• Detailed descriptions for both front and hind tracks.\n• Accurate track measurements for a number of track dimensions including, for certain species, claws lengths and intermediate pad widths.\n• Detailed dung, gait, and similar species descriptions.\n• A beautiful, easy to use interface.\n• The ability to zoom, pinch, and swipe between photos.\n• Wikipedia pages for each species - stored in the app to allow viewing with no internet connection.\n• Information sections including how to measure tracks, basic track anatomy, gait patterns and trailing animals, including a novel section on the psychology behind tracking and how to focus your thinking to maximize your chances of successfully tracking down an animal.\n\niTrack Southern Africa, goes far beyond what a traditional field guide can offer with a powerful search tool developed by Jonah to simplify track identification in the field. It makes use of basic track features, length and width measurements and your locality to narrow down the options. If you’re not sure what criteria to choose, just leave it out and the tool will still provide you with a list of possibilities based on the information you have given it. \n\nSearch by the following criteria:\n• Common/Latin name\n• Track size\n• The number of toes\n• Toe shape\n• Presence or absence of claws\n• Mammal group\n• Location by Southern African country\n\niTrack Southern Africa is a collaborative effort between Dave Hood, a South African Field Guide and Naturalist with a passion for tracking who provided the bulk of the content and Jonah Evans – a wildlife biologist, the Texan State Mammologist and a CyberTracker track and sign specialist and evaluator. Jonah is also the producer of iTrack Wildlife – the definitive North American digital mammal track guide. The app uses Louis Liebenberg’s drawings which are considered to be the most accurate depictions of Southern African animal tracks. \n\nSpecies List:\n\nAardvark\nAardwolf\nAfrican (Cape) Buffalo\nAfrican Civet\nAfrican (Cape) Clawless Otter\nAfrican (Bush) Elephant\nAfrican Wild Cat\nAfrican Wild Dog\nBat-eared Fox\nBlack Rhino\nBlack Wildebeest\nBlack-backed Jackal\nBlesbok\nBlue Wildebeest\nBontebok\nBushbuck\nCape Ground Squirrel\nCape Grysbok\nChacma Baboon\nCheetah\nCommon Duiker\nCommon Waterbuck\nDomestic Cat\nDomestic Cow\nDomestic Dog\nDomestic Sheep\nEland\nGemsbok\nGenets\nGiraffe\nGreater Kudu\nHares\nHippopotamus\nHoney Badger\nHorse\nImpala\nLeopard\nLion\nMountain Reedbuck\nNyala\nOribi\nPorcupine\nRed Hartebeest\nRed Lechwe\nRock Hyrax\nSable Antelope\nSouthern African Hedgehog\nSouthern Reedbuck\nSpotted Hyaena\nSpringbok\nSpringhare\nSteenbok\nStriped Polecat\nSuricate\nTsessebe\nVervet Monkey\nWarthog\nWater (Marsh) Mongoose\nWhite Rhinoceros\nYellow Mongoose\nZebras"

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB. This Application WILL ONLY work on an iPhone or iPod Touch running iOS V7.1 or higher NOT A NORMAL IPOD CLASSIC/NANO and the download is about 320MB."

      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

This not only avoids that, but also calculates the effects of the enchantments based on your stats. Combined with the author's Alchemy app, these are everything you need to make truly epic equipment.\"\n\n\"Phenomenally helpful app!\"\n\n\"...it's super great. Don't think, don't ponder, just buy it because you will not be disappointed.\"\n\n\"The checklist for known enchantments is especially nice for scatterbrained folk like myself.\"\n\n\"Either for the casual player who needs some help or for the min/maxer that has to eke that last percentage out if their equipment\"\n\n\"Fantastic\"\n\n\"Exactly the kind of organized information you need to get the most out of your enchanting experiments.\"\n\n\"The ability to instantly find out if I should disenchant right away or wait until I can craft a stronger version\"\n\n---\n\nLike its predecessor, the Skyrim Alchemist Guide, this guide will undoubtedly see many updates in response to feedback and requests from the users. \n\nSo get it, try it, and let me know what you think.\n(there is a button to \"Email the Author\" from within the app)\n\n---\n\nUPDATE #1\n\n- many improvements have been implemented including: \n* saving multiple outfits.\n* previewing the strength of enchantments during selection.\n* iPad support.\n* other misc improvements.\n\n---\n\nUPDATE #2\n\n-added Notched Pickaxe \n-added Fiery Soul Trap \n-renamed \"Light Damage\" to \"Silent Moons Enchant\" \n-added Soul Gem Size Reference for all creatures \n-fixed description of Fortify Magic \n-fixed Resist Shock on gloves \n\n---\n\nUPDATE #3\n\nVampire Edition: added vampire-specific help for vampire characters.

      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

With the aid of it, you can easily find out, which tones will create the most advantageous composition. Using such schemes you can readily combine from 2 to 4 colors in solving a variety of problems connected with pictorial art, photography and even interior decoration. \nThis application will let you work wisely and efficiently with the color palette using six different schemes. Based on the contrasts or, on the contrary, on the law of assimilation, they let you introduce harmony into any artistic solutions, choose the necessary color and detach the predominant hue."

It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

      "label": "They grow in large numbers in forests and fields. Millions of them are hiding in the protective thicket and many withstand an eager collector. The common mushroom, dearly loved treasure in many kitchens. But once it's found, fundamental doubts replace the initial euphoria. What kind of mushroom is this actually? Is it edible, perhaps toxic, even hallucinogenic? A mushroom identification manual would be useful now - but who likes to crawl through the undergrowth with a bulky book?!\n\n\nNATURE MOBILE has developed an app for all smartphone users that helps with identifying and collecting mushrooms - Mushrooms PRO. With more than *300* species and over *2000* high-resolution images it doesn't have to hide in the thicket. For each mushroom there is a comprehensive description and a selection of images of different perspectives and life tilt. Not only occasional collectors will have their fun with the app - mycologists will enjoy it, too, as the content of the app has been compiled by Dr. GERHARDT, author of many mushroom books and scientific publications about mycology. Dr. GERHARDT has been a long term employee and consultant of Mycology at the Botanical Gardens and in the Botanical Museum of Berlin.\n\n\nSO HOW CAN A MUSHROOM BE IDENTIFIED?\n\nYou can choose from a variety of visual and other characteristic features and thus reduce the list of eligible mushroom species.\n\n\nYOUR PERSONAL TRAINER!\n\n* Learning* with a picture quiz. Polyporus Brumalis, Echinoderma Asperum or rather Armillaria Ostoyae? In case you don't know the right answer to a question, you still have 2 more mushroom lives to go. You can post your score in the high score board.\n\n\nBUT... THERE'S NO INTERNET CONNECTION IN THE WOODS!\n\nNo worries, you only require connectivity for the initial installation and for installing updates so you can always use new features.\n\n\nLANGUAGES\n\nThe complete app is available in German, English, French and Spanish. Species names are available in many other languages, try the LITE version.   \n\n\nSEARCH AND IDENTIFY SPECIES BY\n\n* APPEARANCE AND SCENT\n- size, color, hat, gills, stem, etc.\n* EDIBILITY AND TASTE\n- toxic, edible, allergen, etc.\n* FRUIT BODY TYPE\n- belly mushrooms, gilled mushrooms, truffle, etc.\n* HABITAT\n- deciduous or coniferous forest floor, etc.\n* FAMILY\n- Agaricaceae, Boletaceae, Clathraceae, etc.\n* MEDICINAL BENEFIT AND POISON\n- antibiotic, Psilocybin, Muscarin, etc.\n\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP IDENTIFICATION\n\n* sophisticated questions will guide you to the species you discovered\n* easy identification step by step\n* questions and content conceived by Dr. Gerhardt, member of the German Mycological Society\n\n\nTRAIN YOUR KNOWLEDGE with a QUIZ GAME\n\n* Guess species from pictures\n* Learn to distinguish the different species\n* Become an expert in mycology\n\n\nFollow NATURE MOBILE on Twitter https://twitter.com/NatureMobile, look for us on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/NatureMobile), or visit our website www.NatureMobile.org.\n\n\nSUBMIT YOUR PICTURES AND STORY\n\nDo you want your pictures available to all in the app?\nPlease visit www.NatureMobile.org website to submit pictures.

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Plus goes beyond most basic astronomy apps by providing you with a full-featured space simulator with telescope control and Augmented Reality (AR) mode.\n\nNote that there is no discount upgrade path from SkySafari 6 Plus to SkySafari 6 Pro. Choose carefully!\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We got you covered and release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. Rewritten from the ground up, SkySafari 6 Plus will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog.\n\n4) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations.\n\n5) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n6) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n7) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n8) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n9) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Plus before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Plus will find stars, constellations, planets, and more!\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Learn the history, mythology, and science of astronomy! Browse over 1500 object descriptions and astronomical images. Explore NASA space missions! Stay up-to-date with SkyWeek for all major sky events every day!\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision  – Preserve your eyesight after dark.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Time Flow – Follow the motion of sky objects as days, months, and years are compressed into a few seconds.\n\n• Advanced Search – Find objects using properties other than their name.\n\n• Support for Apple Watch!\n\n• Tonight at a Glance: the Sun, Moon, Planets, ISS, and Iridium flares in one handy view!\n\n• Notifications when the ISS will pass overhead, when Iridium satellites flare, and more!\n\n• Much more!\n\nFor even more features, and a gigantic database aimed at the most dedicated amateur or professional astronomer, check out SkySafari 6 Pro!"

      "label": "There has never been an easier way to read the Bible in one year. Now, with the NIV Bible in One Year app from Hodder & Stoughton, you can both read it and listen to it on the move via your iOS device. \n\nThe NIV Audio Bible in One Year app includes the full text of the NIV Bible (British Text) and the award-winning audio narration by British actor, David Suchet. The Bible text is arranged into 365 manageable daily readings. Each day includes portions from the Psalms or Proverbs, and New and Old Testaments. \n\nThe app also includes a journalling feature in which you can make notes next to the text as you study and bookmark your favourite passages for easy reference. The app also allows you to share notes and Bible verses with friends and family or yourself by SMS (text), email, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nINSTALL NOTE: The price of this app includes the full 80 hours of audio for the NIV Bible read by David Suchet (which amounts to 1.3GB) but it does not automatically download when you purchase the app. Users can download each month’s audio content from within the app to suit their storage limitations. \n\nLISTEN TO THE BIBLE IN ONE YEAR\n- Listen to British actor David Suchet read his award-winning recording as you read the Bible in One Year or while multitasking.\n- Download all the audio at once, or one month at a time, depending on the space available on your device.\n- Follow the verses as they are narrated by selecting ‘Highlight verse with audio’. \n- Turn off the audio capability entirely if you wish to use the app for reading only. \n- Use the Sleep Timer to play the audio for a set number of minutes. \n- The NIV Audio Bible read by David Suchet won 'Bible of the Year' at the 2015 Christian Resources Together Awards.\n\nREAD THE NIV BIBLE IN ONE YEAR EVERYWHERE \n- The NIV Bible in One Year app is available on all iOS devices. \n- The app will automatically open on today’s reading. \n- Switch off ‘Always show today’s reading’ in the Settings menu. \n- Simple navigation: select any day of the year via ‘Find a Day’ in the main menu, or the scroller menu at the top of the screen. \n- Clear, readable layout: the Bible text matches the printed NIV 2011 Bibles. \n- Full Bible text included so no need for a network connection to use any of the app features. \n- Full-text keyword search allows you to find all entries for a particular word in the Bible. \n- Turn off toolbars to give you an uninterrupted reading experience. \n- Adjust text size and brightness to make reading more comfortable. \n\nJOURNALLING\n- Make notes next to the text as you study the Bible in One Year. \n- Bookmark your favourite passages for easy reference. \n- Notes and Bookmarks tabs list of all your entries so you can quickly jump to the one you want. \n- Share notes and verses with friends and family or yourself by SMS (text), email, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nNEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION\nWith over 400 million Bibles in print, the New International Version is the world’s most popular Bible in modern English. Setting the highest standards of reliability and readability, the NIV is ideal for personal reading, public teaching and group study. \nRoyalties from all sales of the NIV help Biblica in their work of translating and distributing Bibles around the world.\n\nThis Anglicised NIV Bible in One Year app has been developed in the UK by Aimer Media in collaboration with Hodder & Stoughton. Due to the terms of Hodder’s NIV license, the app cannot be purchased in the USA or Canada. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nDAVID SUCHET\nDavid Suchet CBE is an acclaimed British actor. He has enjoyed great success with the RSC and in London's West End. He is best known in television for his portrayal of Agatha Christie's detective Hercule Poirot. He is also a practising Anglican.

Whether you are refreshing your knowledge for recurrent training or studying hard for the initial Type Rating Exam, this app will complement your study program to ensure that your level of technical knowledge is as high as possible.\n\nWritten by an experienced Training Captain with thousands of hours on the 757 and 767, B757 / 767 Exam Questions includes a database of over 350 questions.  Each question is of a similar style and layout to the type of question you can expect to see on a Type Rating Exam.  Each question has a choice of three answers, and any questions that are answered incorrectly are automatically transferred to a \"review\" bank of questions which can be re-tested at your convenience.  A brief explanation accompanies most questions, where appropriate, to assist you in your understanding of the accompanying system.   Both metric and imperial measurements are included to ensure that this app is relevant to all 757 / 767 pilots no matter where in the world you happen to be.  \n\nQuestions can be attempted either on an individual system basis, or all at once.  Your score is tallied and presented to you at the end, so you will have a good idea of how effective your study program is."

This is the first project of this kind in the world.\n\nThe highest level of professionalism and functionality has been documented by two tests of computer dictionaries performed up to date. In both of them Leksyka won the competition, and was granted the highest appreciation.\n\nCATEGORIES, e.g. medicine, law, technology, economy, dentistry, anatomy, biology, chemistry, botany, zoology and many, many more!\n\nHere’s why you should use iLeksyka:\n- over 160,000 main entries and more than 220,000 translations,\n- high-quality pronounciation recordings by a native speaker,\n- conjugation of irregular verbs,\n- synonyms and similar entries,\n- over 50 specialty fields developed by specialists: physicians, lawyers, engineers, etc.,\n- frequent updates allow enriching the database – new entries are added daily,\n- specialist entries are briefly explained,\n- included acronyms,\n- prompt search for entries while you type,\n- bookmarks allowing collecting favorite or especially difficult entries,\n- no need to connect to the Internet,\n- active links to other entries,\n- quiz allowing learning new words and expressions selected by the user."

The way in which it works is simple – make a recording with your iPhone, and Warblr will identify the species of bird/s that can be found in that recording, providing you with images and descriptions to help you learn more about our feathered friends.\n\nIn using Warblr, you will be contributing to a citizen science project, and hopefully one day helping to protect endangered species. We will be making the recordings and the data collected on species identification freely available to be used for research and conservation.\n\nWarblr can recognise over 220 species of British bird, and works particularly well for garden and woodland species. Our technology uses the latest techniques in machine learning, and is supported by Queen Mary University of London.\n\n**Please note – if you’re having any issues using Warblr please just drop us a line to hello@warblr.net**\n\nFind us on:\ntwitter.com/WarblrUK\nfacebook.com/Warblr"

Identification can be enjoyed by the whole family.\n\nMushroom Id has been created by professional published ecologists, and uses images selected with the specific aim of aiding identification. Anatomical, ecological and taxonomic information is also included.\n\nMushroom Id can be used to keep a log of your fungi sightings making it easy to build a record of all the species you've seen. \n\nSUNBIRD apps appear in Countryfile's top 10, and have been described as \"incredibly useful\" by ITV's Seth Conway and \"lovely\" by Adam Vaughan of the Guardian.\n\nSUNBIRD field guides are the only products on the market that use the KUSAM species identification methodology. This state of the art method is a modern taxonomic keying system designed specifically for use on mobile devices.\n\nThe app does not need an internet connection, all content is downloaded when the app is purchased. We will be adding new species regularly. Don't forget to keep your app up to date.\n\nWe use the term 'Mushroom' to mean any type of fungi. Traditionally the term has been used only for Field Mushrooms by some, gilled fungi by others. There is no scientific limitation on the term and we have used it in this app for all types of fungi.\n\nThe app is intended for the general interest user with a love of the natural world. The app is not intended for use when foraging for wild foods and we strongly recommend you do not handle or eat wild mushrooms, many are extremely poisonous and easily misidentified. \n\nSunbird Images also develop apps for other companies see our website for details:\nhttp://sunbird.tv/de/sunbird-apps-ebooks/"

Works perfectly.”\n\n****\nDownloaded & used by thousands of seafarers in the USA, Great Britain, Australia, France, Canada, New Zealand & over 50 other countries\n****\n\nThis boating, sailing and marine app provides all skippers, sailors, boaters and fishermen with the essential quick reference knowledge they need to quickly recognise and interpret the buoys and the light markers and improve your overall boating skills and safety on the water, as specified by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) Systems A & B.\n\nWhether out on the water or on shore, in daylight, darkness or poor visibility, simply open the app and search the buoys, beacons, markers and lights in seconds to find the appropriate rule and definition.\n\n- No internet connection required.\n- Simple, easy to use navigation for quick reference.\n- Every IALA buoyage marker available at the touch of a finger.\n- Expertly drawn illustrations accompanied by clear, concise descriptions\n\nIf you are responsible for a vessel at sea, no matter how small or large, you must be able to recognise different types of navigation marks, day or night, and know what they mean.\n\nThis Buoys & Lights app will help improve your overall boating skills and safety on the water.\n\nBuoys & Lights is designed to help all recreational and professional seafarers learn and understand the world buoyage systems which are organised by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA).\n\nThere are two systems in use, IALA A and IALA B and they are both explained fully in this app.\nThere are 4 main sections in this boating safety app:\n\n1. Buoyage: A graphic reference guide with 70 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of buoy, their uses, appearance, permutations and light characteristics.\n\n2. Lights: A graphic reference guide with 12 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of light and their characteristics, used by beacons and lighthouses.\n\n3. IALA Rules: The International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) rules are reproduced in full.\n\n4. Test Yourself: A series of multiple choice questions with 35 graphic representations of buoys and lights helps you check your knowledge.\n\nWe've worked hard to uphold the highest standards of accuracy in this app and want you to enjoy this app in several ways:\n- As an easy reference and revision tool \n- As a powerful visual aide-memoire \n- As an accurate source of safety information tested by marine experts \n- As a way to constantly improve your knowledge and recall via the 'test yourself\" section \n- As a tool to assist you on sailing and boating courses\n\nFEEDBACK & ENDORSEMENT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL BOATING COMMUNITY that we've had is perhaps the best indicator of the value of our apps:\n\n\"I was so impressed with your Nav Lights app that I bought it and downloaded it immediately.\"\n\"I really like the ColRegs part of it and the way you have kept it completely in line with the IRPCS.\"\n\nOTHER APPS IN THIS SERIES:\n- ColRegs: Lights and Shapes provides in depth covers ColRegs Rules 20 to 31 \n\n- ColRegs: The Rules of the Road covers the \"Steering and Sailing Rules\" and \"Sound and Light Signals\" sections of the IRPCS\n\nIn use around the world!"

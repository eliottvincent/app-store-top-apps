      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

This translation includes explanatory footnotes marking variant readings from the Old Syriac, Eastern text, and other Peshitta manuscripts. Other footnotes provide cultural understanding and a system of abbreviations that mark idioms and figures of speech so that they are easily recognizable. The translation is as literal as possible, but with readable English, giving the flavor and rhythm of Eastern language. Aramaic is the language of the first century and the Peshitta is the earliest complete manuscript of the New Testament.\nAbout the Author:\nJanet Magiera has been studying the Peshitta for over 32 years and has developed an entire database of the New Testament from the Aramaic, which produced an interlinear, concordance, parallel translations, and lexicon, as well as the Light of the Word Ministry translation. Her database is currently published with BibleWorks software and soon to be in Bible GT. Mrs. Magiera is an ordained minister and has been teaching Bible studies and classes throughout the country.

      "label": "The original and the best, accept no cheap imitations ! \nRecord a bird singing and use Automatic Recognition to help identify it. Unlike all other apps, no internet or mobile connection is needed.\n\n•   The Times Newspaper said the app \"Does what it says on the \n\ntin\" and were amazed that \"this astonishing piece of software \ncosts about the same as a cup of coffee\".\n\n•   \"In direct comparison Bird Song Id showed better results than Chirpomatic\". - naturschutz.ch - Swiss Birding Magazine \n\nCopied by a few, bettered by none, Bird Song Id is three years  \nahead of anyone else in this field !\n\n•   The Telegraph Newspaper said \"Bird Song Id is a good walk improved, and may even put a spring in your step\".\n\n•   over 1000 good ratings\n\nAutomatic Recognition takes place on the device, no connection to the internet or mobile network is needed.\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs good quality recordings to work. See the HELP below, or follow the Developer Website link to find out how to improve your recordings.\n\nAutomatic Recognition will help identify a good cross section of bird song in the British Isles, but you will need a good quality recording. Lots of blue and green peaks reaching to the top of the analysis graph is a good indication of a quality recording. Help and examples are included in the app to guide you.\n\nHow successful is it ? Our aim is to get the correct bird in the top three of those listed. In our testing of over 1,000 samples we found the success rate to be 85%.\n\nFollow the Developer Website link to see a demo of Automatic Recognition on YouTube\n\n--------------- HELP ----------------\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs a good quality recording of the bird.\n-------------\nOnly record when a single bird is singing, or when a single bird is dominant\n-------------\nThe analysis graph should have plenty of blue and green colors with few or no black peaks.\n-------------\nThe peaks on the graph should reach all the way to the top. Low peaks indicate poor quality and recognition is unlikely.\n-------------\nThe Audio Quality, shown at the top of the results screen, should be at least Good, and preferably Very Good or Excellent\n-------------\nThe highest score should be above 70% to be useful. Below this and the system is telling you it is not sure what the song is.\n-------------\nA difference between two birds of less than 10% is not that significant, so listen to the samples from both to help you further\n-------------\nSee the samples for how the analysis graph should look (to see the samples press the sample button at the top right of the help page)\n-------------\nMake sure it is very quiet apart from the bird song which should be nice and loud\n-------------\nBe as close to the bird as you can be without disturbing it\n-------------\nBe patient, dont expect miracles, the system works but needs good clear recordings\n-------------\nThe microphone is at the bottom of an iPhone, point the bottom of the phone towards the bird\n-------------\nRemove the case from your iPhone if you use one as this can dampen the microphone\n-------------\nRecord a single bird at a time\n-------------\nCapture at least two singing episodes if you can. \n-------------\nRecord for the full 30 seconds\n-------------\nAvoid windy conditions. Air moving over the microphone will mask the bird sounds\n-------------\nMake sure there is plenty of life in the battery. Your device will reduce power going to the microphone as the battery runs down\n-------------\nPlaying songs to the app from recorded material on the internet, other apps or CDs is unlikely to work as this material is digitally processed and edited (inter phase gaps are often shortened). They sound very different to recording birds for real on an iPhone or iPad in the natural environment. Its a bit like putting rocket fuel in a lawn mower.\n-------------"

      "label": "Strong's Concordance, is a concordance of the King James Bible (KJV) that was constructed under the direction of Dr. James Strong (1822–1894) and first published in 1890.\n\nA concordance lets the reader directly compare how the same word may be used else where in the Bible. In this way the Strong's Concordance provides an independent check against translations, and offers an opportunity for greater, and more technically accurate understanding of the Bible text.\n\nWant to see it in action before you buy? Try Strong's Concordance Lite which provides a 100% functional demo of Matthew and Genesis.\n\nThis program does not require internet access, everything you need is all stored on the iDevice.\n\nFeatures:\n* Search for English words, and lookup Greek/Hebrew dictionaries.\n* Proper concordance, listing how the word was translated in other bible verses.\n* Full King James Text is included\n* Click on any blue word for concordance text.\n* Night mode for those that like to read at night (White on black)\n* iPad support\n\nPlease note: This version is not an \"exhaustive\" concordance, and does skip smaller words such as \"and, or, the, a\" as well as some other words. Though we think you'll find it has most (if not all) the words you'll ever need.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for improvement in future versions. Send comments and suggestions to strongs at orionsys.org."

      "label": "There has never been an easier way to read the Bible in one year.

The Bible text is arranged into 365 manageable daily readings. Each day includes portions from the Psalms or Proverbs, and New and Old Testaments. \n\nThe app also includes a journalling feature in which you can make notes next to the text as you study and bookmark your favourite passages for easy reference. The app also allows you to share notes and Bible verses with friends and family or yourself by SMS (text), email, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nINSTALL NOTE: The price of this app includes the full 80 hours of audio for the NIV Bible read by David Suchet (which amounts to 1.3GB) but it does not automatically download when you purchase the app. Users can download each month’s audio content from within the app to suit their storage limitations. \n\nLISTEN TO THE BIBLE IN ONE YEAR\n- Listen to British actor David Suchet read his award-winning recording as you read the Bible in One Year or while multitasking.\n- Download all the audio at once, or one month at a time, depending on the space available on your device.\n- Follow the verses as they are narrated by selecting ‘Highlight verse with audio’. \n- Turn off the audio capability entirely if you wish to use the app for reading only. \n- Use the Sleep Timer to play the audio for a set number of minutes. \n- The NIV Audio Bible read by David Suchet won 'Bible of the Year' at the 2015 Christian Resources Together Awards.\n\nREAD THE NIV BIBLE IN ONE YEAR EVERYWHERE \n- The NIV Bible in One Year app is available on all iOS devices. \n- The app will automatically open on today’s reading. \n- Switch off ‘Always show today’s reading’ in the Settings menu. \n- Simple navigation: select any day of the year via ‘Find a Day’ in the main menu, or the scroller menu at the top of the screen. \n- Clear, readable layout: the Bible text matches the printed NIV 2011 Bibles. \n- Full Bible text included so no need for a network connection to use any of the app features. \n- Full-text keyword search allows you to find all entries for a particular word in the Bible. \n- Turn off toolbars to give you an uninterrupted reading experience. \n- Adjust text size and brightness to make reading more comfortable. \n\nJOURNALLING\n- Make notes next to the text as you study the Bible in One Year. \n- Bookmark your favourite passages for easy reference. \n- Notes and Bookmarks tabs list of all your entries so you can quickly jump to the one you want. \n- Share notes and verses with friends and family or yourself by SMS (text), email, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nNEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION\nWith over 400 million Bibles in print, the New International Version is the world’s most popular Bible in modern English. Setting the highest standards of reliability and readability, the NIV is ideal for personal reading, public teaching and group study. \nRoyalties from all sales of the NIV help Biblica in their work of translating and distributing Bibles around the world.\n\nThis Anglicised NIV Bible in One Year app has been developed in the UK by Aimer Media in collaboration with Hodder & Stoughton. Due to the terms of Hodder’s NIV license, the app cannot be purchased in the USA or Canada. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nDAVID SUCHET\nDavid Suchet CBE is an acclaimed British actor. He has enjoyed great success with the RSC and in London's West End.

Our app is the only tree identification app in the Woodland Trust top apps list.\n\nHave you ever been on a walk in the countryside and wondered \"What tree is that?\"? TreeId is a great tool to help you quickly and easily identify trees you find in the British countryside. It's great fun to use, too. With TreeId, identification can be enjoyed by the whole family, and can engage children with the natural world around them. For the tree enthusiast, there is comprehensive anatomical and ecological information, with high quality images of the leaf, flower, fruit etc. of every species.\n\nWhen you have identified a tree, why not take a photo and record it on our map. See how many species you can identify this year!\n\nThe app does not need an internet connection, all content is downloaded when the app is purchased.\n\nSUNBIRD IMAGES field guides are the only products on the market that use the KUSAM species identification methodology.

A short description and helpful tips are given for each song or call, as well as a photo of each bird. Birds can be sorted by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to rarer species. Or sort by song style, so that you can compare birds that hoot and coo, or those with high pitched songs for example. You can also sort by name, habitat or bird group.\n\nAfter listening, try the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nThe slideshow section can be used as a way to relax, or switch the voiceover on and see if you can say the name of the bird before the voiceover. This is a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?! \n\nIncludes birds from Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Italy."

The fingers of the participants are placed on the planchette that is moved by the spirits about the board to spell out messages.

      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and 'App of the Day'.\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use Automatic Recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can be used without the risk of disturbing nesting birds. \n\nAlthough the technology behind ChirpOMatic is complex, we have used our expertise in app development to make the app easy to use for everyone. You don't need to read a complicated manual, trim sound files, or understand sonograms to use ChirpOMatic. It works rather like Shazam® or SoundHound® do for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and record for 10 seconds. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification.

      "label": "*** This app describes in detail all the 513 bird species which have been recorded in Scotland, with 1,834 premium photographs and more than 892 bird songs. You can map birds with GPS, make your own lists and browse the species in 5 search modes *** \n\nThis exceptional app includes all species which have been listed by the British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee (BOURC). It has been developed by passionate field ornithologists and published ecologists.\n\nA simple identification key narrows the species down (e.g. by foot colour, bill shape, length of tail etc.) leading to the bird searched for and a choice of similar species. You can also look for fragments of a species name through a search screen – the search for “finch“, for example, shows all the species which include the word „finch“ in the species’ name.\n\nDespite the abundance of species provided: in order to precisely identify a bird no previous knowledge or ornithological expert skills are required.\n\nOf decisive help here are the qualitatively high-class large-scale images which show all bird species in their natural environment and, amongst others, originate from renowned photographers of the wildlife agency SUNBIRD IMAGES. The pictures have been chosen from thousands in order to allow the most reliable identification of the birds. The choice of photos is essential for identification: Bird pictures which only show the bird from front, which is the case for many of the sloppily developed apps on the market today, are of little use for birders. \n\nThis app provides extensive texts and data for each bird species with information to:\n\nDescription, ecology, population size, frequency, habitat and much more. In this respect, the texts for this app have especially been written for Scotland. This, amongst others, holds for population size, abundance, breeding status, local distribution (down to subspecies level), status of protection as well as migration.\n\nSpecial features:\n\n– includes all 513 species recorded in Scotland (all occuring subspecies mentioned too!)\n– irregular visitors are marked in red and can be faded-in or -out\n– extensive descriptions to every species with 25 sub-features each!\n– 1,834 well selected photographs, all in high quality (1024 x 768 pixels)\n– photos to each species, including female as well as summer and winter plumage for nearly every species\n– sort and browse species: A-Z, Latin, 18 additional languages, taxonomic\n– egg photographs of 73% of all Scottish species\n– 892 bird songs and calls of 80% of all UK species\n– create sighting lists and sort by place, date, group, and name\n– automatically plots all spots on a map of the UK via GPS, which is editable\n– make notes for each bird spotted\n– easy to use identification key \n– search for Latin or common name (or part of name) through search screen \n\n*** A graphically well-designed layout – easy to use with large lettering *** \n\n\"All Birds Scotland\" is very well suited for keeping personalised watch lists.\n\nOnce downloaded no internet connection needed – just download the app and start birding!\n\nVisit our internet support site for more information.

The children of the promise would have forgotten their heritage and identity and all the history that they ought to have known.\n\nThey would now require some extensive hand-holding as they are taken from passage to passage, and the understanding of each line of scripture is ellucidated and taught to them precept by precept.\n\nIf you want to understand the bible, you will need to be guided by the precepts, which are the keys to unlocking the meanings and intents of its passages in context. Let scripture interpret scripture.\n\nSTART LEARNING PRECEPTS NOW!\n- Start by reading the verses and passages related to each precept;\n- Get the understanding of the precept by reading the cross-linked verses;\n- You begin to see the consistency in scripture when you realise that certain words and phrases maintain specific meaning in all the verses they appear in;\n- Connect the dots and you begin to see the bigger picture of what the bible is really revealing.\n\nMORE FEATURES WITH EACH UPDATE\n- Easy navigation for chapters and verses;\n- Quickly check up on precepts listed under a verse, and link to cross-linked verses;\n- Adjust font sizes for accessibility;\n- Use the contact form to send us messages and what you've discovered;\n- Join our mailing list and get updates about our occasional updates and learning aids;\n\nREDISCOVER THE CORRECT WAY TO UNDERSTAND SCRIPTURE\n- Build up entire teaching series using bible precepts to maintain true scriptural meanings and consistency in the understanding delivered.\n\nJoin us on social media and share the gospel to wake up the lost sheep!\nShare this app with friends and family and be part of their awakening."

This feature has been carefully designed to require no specialist knowledge so even if you are a complete beginner, you will be able to put a name to your discovery. \n\nIcons indicate whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous, or to be avoided because it is unpleasant, but remember to check with an expert before eating any wild fungus.\n\nOnce identified, you can mark the fungus as seen, make notes about it, add your own photos, and automatically check the current date, time, latitude, longitude and Grid Reference. \n\nThe app includes iCloud syncing, so that if you have more than one device (iPhone, iPod or iPad) your sightings will automatically synchronise.\n\n\n\n========= About us =========\n\nWe have been making nature apps since the App Store started in 2008, and have a range of popular bird, bird song, and butterfly apps for all iOS devices - iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad & Apple Watch. Look for our other apps!"

The way in which it works is simple – make a recording with your iPhone, and Warblr will identify the species of bird/s that can be found in that recording, providing you with images and descriptions to help you learn more about our feathered friends.\n\nIn using Warblr, you will be contributing to a citizen science project, and hopefully one day helping to protect endangered species. We will be making the recordings and the data collected on species identification freely available to be used for research and conservation.\n\nWarblr can recognise over 220 species of British bird, and works particularly well for garden and woodland species. Our technology uses the latest techniques in machine learning, and is supported by Queen Mary University of London.\n\n**Please note – if you’re having any issues using Warblr please just drop us a line to hello@warblr.net**\n\nFind us on:\ntwitter.com/WarblrUK\nfacebook.com/Warblr"

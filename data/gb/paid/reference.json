Can I request a Bittern?\"\n\nChosen by Apple for \"Apps for the Great Outdoors\"\n\n\"Identifying a bird by its song is fun and satisfying and this app is a great help\" - The Telegraph, 500 Must-Have Apps\n\n\"Equal parts wildlife guide and feel-good pick-me-up\" - The Guardian, \"Top 10 Green Apps\"\n\nChirp! includes songs and calls for 260 birds, and includes special features such as a ‘human translation’, to tell you what the bird is actually saying.\n\nThe identification and learning of bird songs can be hard, but not with Chirp!. A short description and helpful tips are given for each song or call, as well as a photo of each bird. Birds can be sorted by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to rarer species. Or sort by song style, so that you can compare birds that hoot and coo, or those with high pitched songs for example. You can also sort by name, habitat or bird group.\n\nAfter listening, try the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nThe slideshow section can be used as a way to relax, or switch the voiceover on and see if you can say the name of the bird before the voiceover. This is a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?! \n\nIncludes birds from Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Italy."

The way in which it works is simple – make a recording with your iPhone, and Warblr will identify the species of bird/s that can be found in that recording, providing you with images and descriptions to help you learn more about our feathered friends.\n\nIn using Warblr, you will be contributing to a citizen science project, and hopefully one day helping to protect endangered species. We will be making the recordings and the data collected on species identification freely available to be used for research and conservation.\n\nWarblr can recognise over 220 species of British bird, and works particularly well for garden and woodland species. Our technology uses the latest techniques in machine learning, and is supported by Queen Mary University of London.\n\n**Please note – if you’re having any issues using Warblr please just drop us a line to hello@warblr.net**\n\nFind us on:\ntwitter.com/WarblrUK\nfacebook.com/Warblr"

No skill or knowledge of birds required.\n    • The app includes a reference section with bird sounds, descriptions of the sounds, and photos\n    • Share your recordings with friends using WhatsApp, Messages, Airdrop or Email\n    • ChirpOMatic respects your privacy. You don’t need an account, and your recordings are for you alone.

      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

      "label": "A vital, easy-to-use tool for actors that will revolutionise how you rehearse. Based on the best-selling book.\n\nActions: The Actors’ Thesaurus is a vital tool for actors. It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions. You cannot act moods. You need to be doing something with every line. You need an aim to achieve, and an action selected to help achieve that aim. ‘Actions’ are active verbs. In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

Once downloaded no internet connection needed – just download the app and start birding!\n\nVisit our internet support site for more information on www.sunbird.tv. We are happy, if you like our app. Please don't hesitate to email us if you have any questions or suggestions or comments at: birds-uk@sunbird.tv"

A brief explanation accompanies most questions, where appropriate, to assist you in your understanding of the accompanying system.   Both metric and imperial measurements are included to ensure that this app is relevant to all 757 / 767 pilots no matter where in the world you happen to be.  \n\nQuestions can be attempted either on an individual system basis, or all at once.

The range of each species is described in detail (instead of range maps). In addition to the birds‘ geographical ranges, the altitudinal zones which they inhabit are given. The zones and their limits are:\n\n• Tropical Zone:\n  sea level to 4500–5000 ft (1,400 to 1,500 m)\n  \n• Subtropical Zone:\n  4500–5000 to 7500–8500 ft (1,400–1,500 m to 2,300–2,600 m)\n  \n• Temperate Zone:\n  7500–8500 to 9500–11,500 ft (2,300–2,600 m to 2,900–3,500 m)\n  \n• Páramo or Puna Zone:\n  9500–11,500 ft (2,900–3,500 m) to snow line \n\nThe current app version contains the descriptions and images of 1,700+ bird species found in Brazil. Moreover, an ornithological dictionary (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese) and detailed illustrations and drawings of bird anatomy are included.\n\nThe app features a modern, intuitive graphical user interface with functions for searching the birds‘ names and in the full text, switching the sorting language for the listings and sort by English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or the scientific (Latin) notation. In addition to the bird descriptions, the name of the birds in many languages can be displayed.\n\nAnother clever feature is the Field Note Editor, which allows you to record your bird sightings with predefined locations settings (which can be overwritten by the user) and many other commonly recorded data items.\n\nApart from using the optional backup and restore functions for Field Notes and Favorites, the app runs completely offline and there is no need for an internet connection during usage in the field.\n\nAs with The Birds of South America, which contains more than 3,000 birds found on the entire continent, also The Birds of Brazil runs on any iOS device and can exchange Field Notes and Favorites list between identical app versions on two or more devices via Bluetooth."

God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

The guide has been created by professional published ecologists, accept no cheap imitations!\n\nAll native British tree species are covered. Naturalised species are covered too. \n\nTreeId was one of BBC Countryfile's top 10 apps and described as \"incredibly useful\" by ITV's Seth Conway and \"a lovely app\" by Adam Vaughan of the Guardian. It was voted No. 5 in the Guardian Green Living top 10 apps and was given the  \"Best\" award by iPhone Apps Plus.\n\nHave you ever been on a walk in the countryside during the winter months  and wondered \"What tree is that?\". WinterTreeId is a great tool to help you  identify trees during the winter months when the tree may have no leaves, flowers or fruits to go on. Its great fun to use too. With WinterTreeId, identification can be enjoyed by the whole family, and can engage children with the natural world around them. For the tree enthusiast, there is comprehensive anatomical and ecological information, with high quality images of every species.\n\nWhen you have identified a tree, why not record your sighting  using our mapping screen. You can share your sighting with all other users too if you like. See how many species you can identify this winter!\n\nThere is a great quiz that really improves your id skills. Compete to be our highest scorer!\n\nThe app does not need an internet connection, all content is downloaded when the app is purchased.\n\nSUNBIRD IMAGES field guides are the only products on the market that use the KUSAM species identification methodology. This state of the art method is a modern taxonomic keying system designed specifically for use on mobile devices."

Perform an automatic calculation where the circuit is sized automatically or enter fixed sizes to run a calculation check on an existing design. Created for electrical engineers, electricians and designers. Suitable for Industrial, Commercial or Domestic Low Voltage Circuits.\n\nSimple, fast and reliable. 17th edition cable sizer performs cable Calculation for AC circuits in line with British Standard 7671:2008(2011) IEE Wiring regulations, without having to lookup the relevant tables.\n\nSimply enter the circuit parameters, hit calculate, and 17th edition cable sizer does the work for you by selecting the correct cable based on current carrying capacity, earth loop impedance and voltage drop. If you want to change a parameter, go back and modify it, then re-calculate to see the difference.\n\nAlternatively set the cable size and number of conductors in parallel and perform a calculation to check an existing design.\n\nResults are presented in a simple format with all rating factors given, which can then be sent by email.\nAll rating factors are considered, all installation methods available, power factor and conductor operating temperatures are incorporated into the calculation. Parallel cables are supported automatically if current exceeds maximum available for cable type.\n\nR1+R2, Zs and Fault currents are calculated and displayed. Automatic checks of Zs are performed for MCB's, RCBO's and BS3036 fuses.\n\nThe adiabatic calculation is also performed for applicable cable types with the ability to choose either armouring or separate CPC type. This provides circuit disconnection times based on the minimum fault current for BS88, BS1361 and BS3036 fuses.\n\nTypical external earth loop impedances can be used based on public supply type or transformer size.\n\nThe following cables are supported (in every available size):\n\nBS6724 Single Core and Multicore Armoured XLPE Copper/Aluminium\nBS5467 Single Core and Multicore Armoured PVC Copper/Aluminium\nFlat Twin and earth XLPE\nFlat Twin and earth PVC\n6491B Single core XLPE Copper/Aluminium\n6491X Single core PVC Copper/Aluminium\n\nThe following protective devices can be used:\n\nBS EN 60898 MCB Types B, C and D\nBS EN 60947-2 MCCB\nBS EN 61009-1 RCBO 30mA\nBS 88 HRC Fuses\nBS 3036 Rewireable Fuse\nBS 1361 Cartridge Fuse\n\nAll the data is stored locally on the phone so no Internet connection is ever required.\n\nIf you like this app, please rate it.

The fingers of the participants are placed on the planchette that is moved by the spirits about the board to spell out messages.

Not only does it bring this pop icon into the 21st century, but this single app gives you twenty different talking board designs to choose from!...\" - Spiritboard\n\n\"Best app of its kind\"  - 2hightech\n\n\"I love it! I love how you can pick the boards, I got the fire one. It's hot. :D I'm partly \"christian\", and I know the spiritual world is out there. This board helps me find those spirits and talk to them. It's great to talk to certain people again, knowing they aren't with me on earth, in physical form, but in spirit.\" - AppleNutsSPM\n\n___________\nNOTE: Some people think that this board talks with a voice. No, talking board is the generic name by which this kind of board is known."

      "label": "Tired of all those chordfinder apps that just give you the standard results every app gives you? Fretter is the new kid on the block. And it's great. Ugly, but great! \n\nWe didn't sit behind our computers typing in all those chord diagrams, no we spent our time better. We came up with a way to give you lots of great correct diagrams, without needing us to do boring stuff: Fretter teaches your iPhone basic musictheory and with that knowledge it has the power to give you every possible diagram there is. Want to see how to play Cmaj7/F# on a Guitar with a Dropped D tuning? Fretter knows how to search for it! (We didn't try, but if it's possible to play, it will definitely show up. Yes, we're lazy. :) )\n\nStill, Fretter is great. And it does awesome stuff like reverse chord lookup (for the creative geniuses among you), and you can also strum the diagrams to hear how they sound. Easy if you want to find the perfect sounding Dmaj9 or whatever strange chord you need!\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Fretter!\n\nFor a more formal description, please continue reading.\n\nLooking for ways to play all those chords on your guitar, banjo, ukulele or mandolin? Interested in a reverse lookup function? Fretter: the ultimate chordfinder!\n\nFretter doesn't rely on a database with diagrams, instead it calculates all the possible diagrams for a given chord/instrument/tuning combination. It's algorithm is optimized to only present to you the chords that you can actually play as a human.\n\nBecause Fretter is build this way, you can select any tuning and still have all the possible chords presented to you.\n\nYou can easily select a basic or advanced chord, optionally with added bassnote, and go to the diagrams. Each diagram has extra information about the chordnotes and the intervals used.\n\nA very nice feature is the audio playback. You can hear how the chord variations sound so you can easily select which variant you like the most.\n\nAlso included is a reverse lookup option. Nice if you are a bit adventurous and you are coming up with your own chords on your instrument, but don't know how they are called. Fretter can help you here by providing you with the correct naming.\n\nIf you are looking for a chord reference app: this is what you need.\n\n\"Where this app stands out though, is not in its vast reference of chords; it is in it’s reverse look up option.\"\n4/5 stars on AppAdvice.com\n\nFeature list:\n* Support for Guitar, 4,5-string Banjo, Ukulele, Mandolin, Lute,  Bouzouki, 4-string Bass, Pipa\n* 50+ chordtypes\n* Tunings: 75+ predefined and custom.\n* Added bassnote (C/D)\n* Audio Playback\n* Reverse lookup\n* Chord Intervals\n* Note Names\n\n\nPlease contact us by email if you experience a bug!"

The specially written bird notes cover the appearance, habitat, diet, lifespan, nesting habits, rarity status, and distribution in Britain, as well as interesting facts. \n\nThe photo-based Bird Finder will quickly identify a mystery bird, then you can mark it as seen, add your own photos, and make a note about it. Automatically note the current date, time, latitude, longitude and Grid Reference. The app includes iCloud syncing, so that if you have more than one device (iPhone, iPod or iPad) your sightings will automatically synchronise.\n\n\"I don't say this often, but you guys should charge more for this neat little piece of work! I almost feel guilty now, for the price!\" - AppStore review\n\nGreat features! This is the ONLY budget British bird app with the following features: \n• A photo-based BIRD FINDER based on appearance, habitat, location, date and more \n• Carefully selected photos of MALES, FEMALES and JUVENILES, to show the main features \n• Labelled photos of KEY FEATURES \n• A COMPARE IMAGES feature \n• A SONG or CALL for EVERY BIRD \n• A HISTORY feature to make it easy to go back to the last bird you looked at \n• Select the birds for the area WHERE YOU LIVE \n• European distribution maps for EVERY BIRD \n• A BACK-UP system so you can save your data \n• iCLOUD syncing to synchronise your sightings across your devices \n\nThe Pocket Birds app includes birds that are likely to be seen without making a special trip, plus well-known species.

      "label": "THE PREMIER IPAD ATLAS - with RETINA VECTOR MAPS\n\nThe World HD is unique in the app store because it includes both a complete set of country maps AND the largest world fact book.  These enable it to answer questions which Atlases and fact books cannot:  Atlases show you where countries are located, but have very little information about them; fact books tell you about each country, but their maps leave you guessing about where places are located.\n\n\n___________ HOW IT WORKS ___________\n\nThe interface is animated and interactive.

      "label": "SkySafari 6 Pro will revolutionize your astronomical viewing experience.  It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, flawless telescope control, Augmented Reality (AR) mode, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Discover why SkySafari 6 Pro is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what's new in version 6:\n\n1) Complete support for iOS 13 and iPhone 11. We release regular updates.\n\n2) Clouds and Astronomy. Two words that rarely go together. SkySafari 6 Pro will (optionally) back up all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n3) We Have The Best Stars. Precise, modern and deep. We’ve updated our star catalog to use the latest and greatest, UCAC5 star catalog. If 25 million stars down to 15th magnitude isn’t enough for you, an easy in-app purchase gets you down to 16.5 magnitude and a whopping 100 million stars!\n\n4) We Have The Best Galaxies. The PGC catalog includes galaxies down to 18th magnitude. Want more galaxies? How about 2.6 million more? An in-app purchase gives you access to the largest galaxy database available for your device.\n\n5) Observers First. A redesign of our tools puts the active observer first. Quick access to features like your equipment, observing sites, lists, and observations make it easy and enjoyable to get out, observe, and record your observations. The observing sessions feature lets you collect your observations into groups that span a few hours, or a few nights.\n\n6) Graph It. The completely new graph tool will give a quick visual representation of an object’s altitude above the horizon. Essential for planning your night’s observations.\n\n7) Plan It. Make the most of your time under the stars. Our updated planner is a powerful tool that lets you create a list of targets for your observing session with filters like object types, specific time ranges, constellation, catalog, and more. Plan it and get more done.\n\n8) Say It. Ever just wanted to just yell at your device and tell it what to do!? SkySafari 6 adds basic voice control for a wide range of operations. Say “select Jupiter,” “search for Titan,” “center on Polaris” and SkySafari will do the work for you. Yelling optional. \n\n9) Tilt It. Every old astronomy app these days lets your tilt and pan your device to show different parts of the sky, but who else lets you control your telescope that way!? “Tilt to slew” is an optional mode allowing you to keep your eye in the eyepiece, and, using the accelerometers in your device, gently translate the movements of your hands into smooth telescope motion.\n\n10) Share It. SkySafari 6 is more than just a mobile app, it’s a new system to help organize and share your observing experiences. With a free signup, you can see and share your observing data from our web portal, LiveSky.com! Affordable premium memberships add online editing, so you can not only view, but edit your observations, add new observing sites, manage your equipment and more. Finally, (coming soon) you can view, edit and manage your settings files with SkySafari Web, our fully functional web version.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 6 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n• Hold your device up, and SkySafari 6 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n• Simulate the night sky up to 10,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n• Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n• Night Vision.\n\n• Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n• Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n• Much more!"

      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

Use your finger to spin the knot and see how it looks from any angle in 3D!  \n\nEach 3D knot has detailed reference information including tying pointers, strength and reliability, structural info, and Ashley reference numbers (ABoK) and occasionally the history behind the knot.\n\nThe knots are arranged by both category (Boating, Climbing, Fishing, Scouting, etc) and type (Bend, Loop, Stopper, etc).  If you find a knot you like or want to come back to later, add it to your Favorites list for quick reference.

      "label": "THE PREMIER IPAD ATLAS - with RETINA VECTOR MAPS\n\nThe World HD is unique in the app store because it includes both a complete set of country maps AND the largest world fact book.  These enable it to answer questions which Atlases and fact books cannot:  Atlases show you where countries are located, but have very little information about them; fact books tell you about each country, but their maps leave you guessing about where places are located.\n\n\n___________ HOW IT WORKS ___________\n\nThe interface is animated and interactive.  Touch a country on the world map and the Retina vector country map opens while the factbook slides onto the screen, each topic neatly organized as tiles along the edge of the map.  Touch a factbook tile and it zooms out to reveal detailed information about that topic.  Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the drop-down list and The World HD zooms in on it then opens the map and factbook.\n\nThe zoomable world map is not just the fastest way to select a country it also enables you to visualize and understand entire regions.  It is so intuitive and easy to explore that once you get started it's hard to stop!\n\n\n___________ FEATURES ___________\n\nRETINA VECTOR MAPS\n** Includes high-resolution Retina vector maps for EVERY COUNTRY built-in!  Unlike the other atlases, these maps remain in focus at all magnifications so you can easily see even the smallest detail.  These aren't the CIA maps found in the factbooks, they are used in printed atlases.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n** Contains geopolitical and demographic information on 300 countries and regions.\n\nNO INTERNET CONNECTION is required\n** Except for live Wikipedia content, all data and maps are built-in\n\nINNOVATIVE FACT BOOK PANEL\n** Presents each section of the fact book as tiles enabling you to quickly find what you need, while keeping the country map in view.\n\nHIGHLY ANIMATED INTERFACE\n** Responds to your touches and gestures so you can quickly find the information you are looking for.\n\nCIA WORLD FACTBOOK\n** This trusted source of current country information is built-in for every country, including sections on: introduction, geography, people, economy, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues.\n\nWIKIPEDIA\n** View the live, community-written Wikipedia content for each country, island, and remote region within the app.\n\nSHOWS YOU where countries are located\n** Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the country list and The World zooms to it on the world map and opens the Fact Book Panel\n\nDESIGNED FOR YOUR IPAD & IPHONE\n** Thoughtfully uses the whole screen to present maps and data"

      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

Fantastic photos, songs, calls, distribution maps and detailed information for over 200 birds - all the common and best known birds in Britain arranged by family or alphabetically. The specially written bird notes cover the appearance, habitat, diet, lifespan, nesting habits, rarity status, and distribution in Britain, as well as interesting facts. \n\nThe photo-based Bird Finder will quickly identify a mystery bird, then you can mark it as seen, add your own photos, and make a note about it. Automatically note the current date, time, latitude, longitude and Grid Reference. The app includes iCloud syncing, so that if you have more than one device (iPhone, iPod or iPad) your sightings will automatically synchronise.\n\n\"I don't say this often, but you guys should charge more for this neat little piece of work! I almost feel guilty now, for the price!\" - AppStore review\n\nGreat features! This is the ONLY budget British bird app with the following features: \n• A photo-based BIRD FINDER based on appearance, habitat, location, date and more \n• Carefully selected photos of MALES, FEMALES and JUVENILES, to show the main features \n• Labelled photos of KEY FEATURES \n• A COMPARE IMAGES feature \n• A SONG or CALL for EVERY BIRD \n• A HISTORY feature to make it easy to go back to the last bird you looked at \n• Select the birds for the area WHERE YOU LIVE \n• European distribution maps for EVERY BIRD \n• A BACK-UP system so you can save your data \n• iCLOUD syncing to synchronise your sightings across your devices \n\nThe Pocket Birds app includes birds that are likely to be seen without making a special trip, plus well-known species.

The way in which it works is simple – make a recording with your iPhone, and Warblr will identify the species of bird/s that can be found in that recording, providing you with images and descriptions to help you learn more about our feathered friends.\n\nIn using Warblr, you will be contributing to a citizen science project, and hopefully one day helping to protect endangered species. We will be making the recordings and the data collected on species identification freely available to be used for research and conservation.\n\nWarblr can recognise over 220 species of British bird, and works particularly well for garden and woodland species. Our technology uses the latest techniques in machine learning, and is supported by Queen Mary University of London.\n\n**Please note – if you’re having any issues using Warblr please just drop us a line to hello@warblr.net**\n\nFind us on:\ntwitter.com/WarblrUK\nfacebook.com/Warblr"

It is British-made and is the only mushroom app using recognised English names (as specified by the British Mycological Society).\n\nA ‘Fungus Finder’ is included to identify mystery fungi. This feature has been carefully designed to require no specialist knowledge so even if you are a complete beginner, you will be able to put a name to your discovery. \n\nIcons indicate whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous, or to be avoided because it is unpleasant, but remember to check with an expert before eating any wild fungus.\n\nOnce identified, you can mark the fungus as seen, make notes about it, add your own photos, and automatically check the current date, time, latitude, longitude and Grid Reference. \n\nThe app includes iCloud syncing, so that if you have more than one device (iPhone, iPod or iPad) your sightings will automatically synchronise.\n\n\n\n========= About us =========\n\nWe have been making nature apps since the App Store started in 2008, and have a range of popular bird, bird song, and butterfly apps for all iOS devices - iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad & Apple Watch.

These sites have varied enormously but are all of historical interest.  Prior to World War 1 these sites were simply large farmer's fields.  In the 1930s during the period of German rearmament literally hundreds of airfields were constructed by British workers followed later by more built by Canadian and US Army Engineers.\n\nDuring World War 2 these airfields not only hosted British forces but those of American, Australian, Belgian, Canadian, Czech, Dutch, Free French, New Zealand, Norwegian, Polish and Soviet Air Forces.  Where each of these nationalities was located is illustrated together with a short historical text about the airfield.  A glossary is included as an orientation aid for the many and varied military and civilian units involved.  The entire airfield list can be browsed or searched and a word search can also be made of the text relating to each one.\n\nThis app utilises Google Maps and is relies on a functioning internet connection for map and satellite imagery."

The range of each species is described in detail (instead of range maps). In addition to the birds‘ geographical ranges, the altitudinal zones which they inhabit are given. The zones and their limits are:\n\n• Tropical Zone:\n  sea level to 4500–5000 ft (1,400 to 1,500 m)\n  \n• Subtropical Zone:\n  4500–5000 to 7500–8500 ft (1,400–1,500 m to 2,300–2,600 m)\n  \n• Temperate Zone:\n  7500–8500 to 9500–11,500 ft (2,300–2,600 m to 2,900–3,500 m)\n  \n• Páramo or Puna Zone:\n  9500–11,500 ft (2,900–3,500 m) to snow line \n\nThe current app version contains the descriptions and images of 1,000+ bird species found in Argentina. Moreover, an ornithological dictionary (English, French, Spanish, Portuguese) and detailed illustrations and drawings of bird anatomy are included.\n\nThe app features a modern, intuitive graphical user interface with functions for searching the birds‘ names and in the full text, switching the sorting language for the listings and sort by English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or the scientific (Latin) notation. In addition to the bird descriptions, the name of the birds in many languages can be displayed.\n\nAnother clever feature is the Field Note Editor, which allows you to record your bird sightings with predefined locations settings (which can be overwritten by the user) and many other commonly recorded data items.\n\nApart from using the optional backup and restore functions for Field Notes and Favorites, the app runs completely offline and there is no need for an internet connection during usage in the field.\n\nAs with The Birds of South America, which contains more than 3,000 birds found on the entire continent, also The Birds of Argentina runs on any iOS device and can exchange Field Notes and Favorites list between identical app versions on two or more devices via Bluetooth."

In addition to the birds‘ geographical ranges, the altitudinal zones which they inhabit are given.

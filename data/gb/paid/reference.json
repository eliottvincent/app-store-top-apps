It is perhaps the most widely used and admired book for use in rehearsals today – and is now available on your iPhone or iPad to help you find exactly the right action word within seconds.\n\nActors need actions.

In order to play a line truthfully, you need to discover the action that suits that particular situation and that particular line. That is where this app comes in…\n\nIt is a fully searchable, easy-to-navigate thesaurus of active verbs, that will help you refine your acting choice until you find the action you require to make each line come alive.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n·  A to Z search, and predictive search function\n·  Emotional groupings to help you pinpoint the action you require\n·  Bookmark, note-making and random word functions\n·  Share your actions on social media or by email\n·  Full instructions on how to use actioning in rehearsal, plus how to use the app\n\nFor actors at all levels and of all ages, Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus will revolutionise how you rehearse. Once you’ve started using it, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.\n\n‘If you want to act, or act better, Actions will take you a long way on the journey to excellence’ Terry Johnson\n\n'Actioning ain't easy – but it's so useful' Zawe Ashton\n\nBased on the bestselling book Actions: The Actors’ Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams"

      "label": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes (including slant rhymes), synonyms, antonyms, homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context). Use Apple's local dictionaries or ours online if you are unsure of any meanings.\n\nYou get a database of over 150,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an Internet connection, but if you are online, we'll connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love, ad-free! Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

A short description and helpful tips are given for each song or call, as well as a photo of each bird. Birds can be sorted by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to rarer species. Or sort by song style, so that you can compare birds that hoot and coo, or those with high pitched songs for example. You can also sort by name, habitat or bird group.\n\nAfter listening, try the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nThe slideshow section can be used as a way to relax, or switch the voiceover on and see if you can say the name of the bird before the voiceover. This is a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?! \n\nIncludes birds from Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Italy."

Buoyage: A graphic reference guide with 70 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of buoy, their uses, appearance, permutations and light characteristics.\n\n2. Lights: A graphic reference guide with 12 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of light and their characteristics, used by beacons and lighthouses.\n\n3. IALA Rules: The International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) rules are reproduced in full.\n\n4. Test Yourself: A series of multiple choice questions with 35 graphic representations of buoys and lights helps you check your knowledge.\n\nWe've worked hard to uphold the highest standards of accuracy in this app and want you to enjoy this app in several ways:\n- As an easy reference and revision tool \n- As a powerful visual aide-memoire \n- As an accurate source of safety information tested by marine experts \n- As a way to constantly improve your knowledge and recall via the 'test yourself\" section \n- As a tool to assist you on sailing and boating courses\n\nFEEDBACK & ENDORSEMENT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL BOATING COMMUNITY that we've had is perhaps the best indicator of the value of our apps:\n\n\"I was so impressed with your Nav Lights app that I bought it and downloaded it immediately.\"\n\"I really like the ColRegs part of it and the way you have kept it completely in line with the IRPCS.\"\n\nOTHER APPS IN THIS SERIES:\n- ColRegs: Lights and Shapes provides in depth covers ColRegs Rules 20 to 31 \n\n- ColRegs: The Rules of the Road covers the \"Steering and Sailing Rules\" and \"Sound and Light Signals\" sections of the IRPCS\n\nIn use around the world!"

      "label": "The original and the best, accept no cheap imitations ! \nRecord a bird singing and use Automatic Recognition to help identify it. Unlike all other apps, no internet or mobile connection is needed.\n\n•   The Times Newspaper said the app \"Does what it says on the \n\ntin\" and were amazed that \"this astonishing piece of software \ncosts about the same as a cup of coffee\".\n\n•   \"In direct comparison Bird Song Id showed better results than Chirpomatic\". - naturschutz.ch - Swiss Birding Magazine \n\nCopied by a few, bettered by none, Bird Song Id is three years  \nahead of anyone else in this field !\n\n•   The Telegraph Newspaper said \"Bird Song Id is a good walk improved, and may even put a spring in your step\".\n\n•   over 1000 good ratings\n\nAutomatic Recognition takes place on the device, no connection to the internet or mobile network is needed.\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs good quality recordings to work. See the HELP below, or follow the Developer Website link to find out how to improve your recordings.\n\nAutomatic Recognition will help identify a good cross section of bird song in the British Isles, but you will need a good quality recording. Lots of blue and green peaks reaching to the top of the analysis graph is a good indication of a quality recording. Help and examples are included in the app to guide you.\n\nHow successful is it ? Our aim is to get the correct bird in the top three of those listed. In our testing of over 1,000 samples we found the success rate to be 85%.\n\nFollow the Developer Website link to see a demo of Automatic Recognition on YouTube\n\n--------------- HELP ----------------\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs a good quality recording of the bird.\n-------------\nOnly record when a single bird is singing, or when a single bird is dominant\n-------------\nThe analysis graph should have plenty of blue and green colors with few or no black peaks.\n-------------\nThe peaks on the graph should reach all the way to the top. Low peaks indicate poor quality and recognition is unlikely.\n-------------\nThe Audio Quality, shown at the top of the results screen, should be at least Good, and preferably Very Good or Excellent\n-------------\nThe highest score should be above 70% to be useful. Below this and the system is telling you it is not sure what the song is.\n-------------\nA difference between two birds of less than 10% is not that significant, so listen to the samples from both to help you further\n-------------\nSee the samples for how the analysis graph should look (to see the samples press the sample button at the top right of the help page)\n-------------\nMake sure it is very quiet apart from the bird song which should be nice and loud\n-------------\nBe as close to the bird as you can be without disturbing it\n-------------\nBe patient, dont expect miracles, the system works but needs good clear recordings\n-------------\nThe microphone is at the bottom of an iPhone, point the bottom of the phone towards the bird\n-------------\nRemove the case from your iPhone if you use one as this can dampen the microphone\n-------------\nRecord a single bird at a time\n-------------\nCapture at least two singing episodes if you can. \n-------------\nRecord for the full 30 seconds\n-------------\nAvoid windy conditions. Air moving over the microphone will mask the bird sounds\n-------------\nMake sure there is plenty of life in the battery. Your device will reduce power going to the microphone as the battery runs down\n-------------\nPlaying songs to the app from recorded material on the internet, other apps or CDs is unlikely to work as this material is digitally processed and edited (inter phase gaps are often shortened). They sound very different to recording birds for real on an iPhone or iPad in the natural environment. Its a bit like putting rocket fuel in a lawn mower.\n-------------"

      "label": "SkySafari makes stargazing a simple pleasure. It has the largest database of any astronomy app, includes every solar system object ever discovered, offers unparalleled accuracy, advanced planning and logging tools, flawless telescope control, and provides the very best experience under the stars when you depend on it. Don’t postpone joy. Discover why SkySafari is the #1 recommended astronomy app for serious amateur astronomers since 2009.\n\nHere's what’s new in version 7:\n\n+ Complete support for iOS 15 and iPhone 13. Version 7 brings a new and immersive stargazing experience.\n\n+ Events Finder - go to the new Events section to unlock a powerful search engine that finds astronomical events visible tonight and far into the future. The finder dynamically generates a listing of moon phases, eclipses, planetary moon events, meteor showers and planetary phenomenon such as conjunctions, elongations and oppositions.\n\n+ Notifications - the notifications section has been completely revamped to allow you to customize and manage which events trigger an alert notification on your device.\n\n+ Telescope Support - telescope control is at the heart of SkySafari.  Version 7 takes a giant leap forward by supporting ASCOM Alpaca and INDI.  These next generation control protocols allow you to effortlessly connect to hundreds of compatible astronomical devices.\n\nStargazing is often done on your own but looking up at the stars reminds us that we are all part of a larger interconnected universe. SkySafari 7 brings social stargazing to mobile devices with two new features to help you connect with other like minded people.\n\nOneSky - allows you to see what other users are observing, in real time.  This feature highlights objects in the sky chart and indicates with a number how many users are observing a particular object.\n\nSkyCast - allows you to guide a friend or group around the night sky through their own copy of SkySafari. After initiating SkyCast, you can generate a link and conveniently share it with other SkySafari users via text message, apps or social media accounts.\n\n+ Sky Tonight -  jump to the new Tonight section to see what’s visible in your sky tonight.  Expanded information has been designed to help plan your night and includes  Moon & Sun info, calendar curations, events and the best positioned deep sky and solar system objects.\n\n+ Improved Observation Tools - SkySafari is the perfect tool to help you plan, record and organize your observations.  New workflows make it easier to add, search, filter and sort data.\n\n+ Home Screen and Lock Screen Widgets  keep your favorite astro information at your fingertips.\n\nThe Small Touches:\n\n+ You can now edit the Jupiter GRS Longitude Value in the Settings.\n+ Better Moon Age calculation.\n+ New grid & reference options allow you to display Solstice and Equinox markers, Orbit + Node markers for all solar system objects, and tick marks and labels for the Ecliptic, Meridian, and Equator reference lines.\n+ Previous In-app Purchases are Now Free -  this includes the H-R diagram, 3D Galaxy view, and the PGC galaxy and GAIA star catalogs. Enjoy.\n+ Many more.\n\nIf you haven't used SkySafari 7 Pro before, here's what you can do with it:\n\n+ Hold your device up, and SkySafari 7 Pro will find stars, constellations, planets, and more! The star chart updates automatically with your movements for the ultimate stargazing experience.\n\n+ Simulate the night sky up to 100,000 years in the past or future! Animate meteor showers, conjunctions, eclipses, and other celestial events.\n\n+ Control your telescope, log and plan your observations.\n\n+ Optionally backup all of your observing data in our secure cloud storage and make it easily accessible to multiple devices as well as from our new web interface, LiveSky.com.\n\n+ Augmented Reality (AR) mode\n\n+ Night Vision.\n\n+ Orbit Mode. Leave the Earth’s surface behind, and fly through our solar system.\n\n+ Galaxy View shows the position of deep sky objects in our Milky Way!\n\n+ Much more!"

      "label": "There has never been an easier way to read the Bible in one year. Now, with the NIV Bible in One Year app from Hodder & Stoughton, you can both read it and listen to it on the move via your iOS device. \n\nThe NIV Audio Bible in One Year app includes the full text of the NIV Bible (British Text) and the award-winning audio narration by British actor, David Suchet. The Bible text is arranged into 365 manageable daily readings. Each day includes portions from the Psalms or Proverbs, and New and Old Testaments. \n\nThe app also includes a journalling feature in which you can make notes next to the text as you study and bookmark your favourite passages for easy reference. The app also allows you to share notes and Bible verses with friends and family or yourself by SMS (text), email, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nINSTALL NOTE: The price of this app includes the full 80 hours of audio for the NIV Bible read by David Suchet (which amounts to 1.3GB) but it does not automatically download when you purchase the app. Users can download each month’s audio content from within the app to suit their storage limitations. \n\nLISTEN TO THE BIBLE IN ONE YEAR\n- Listen to British actor David Suchet read his award-winning recording as you read the Bible in One Year or while multitasking.\n- Download all the audio at once, or one month at a time, depending on the space available on your device.\n- Follow the verses as they are narrated by selecting ‘Highlight verse with audio’. \n- Turn off the audio capability entirely if you wish to use the app for reading only. \n- Use the Sleep Timer to play the audio for a set number of minutes. \n- The NIV Audio Bible read by David Suchet won 'Bible of the Year' at the 2015 Christian Resources Together Awards.\n\nREAD THE NIV BIBLE IN ONE YEAR EVERYWHERE \n- The NIV Bible in One Year app is available on all iOS devices. \n- The app will automatically open on today’s reading. \n- Switch off ‘Always show today’s reading’ in the Settings menu. \n- Simple navigation: select any day of the year via ‘Find a Day’ in the main menu, or the scroller menu at the top of the screen. \n- Clear, readable layout: the Bible text matches the printed NIV 2011 Bibles. \n- Full Bible text included so no need for a network connection to use any of the app features. \n- Full-text keyword search allows you to find all entries for a particular word in the Bible. \n- Turn off toolbars to give you an uninterrupted reading experience. \n- Adjust text size and brightness to make reading more comfortable. \n\nJOURNALLING\n- Make notes next to the text as you study the Bible in One Year. \n- Bookmark your favourite passages for easy reference. \n- Notes and Bookmarks tabs list of all your entries so you can quickly jump to the one you want. \n- Share notes and verses with friends and family or yourself by SMS (text), email, Twitter and Facebook.\n\nNEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION\nWith over 400 million Bibles in print, the New International Version is the world’s most popular Bible in modern English. Setting the highest standards of reliability and readability, the NIV is ideal for personal reading, public teaching and group study. \nRoyalties from all sales of the NIV help Biblica in their work of translating and distributing Bibles around the world.\n\nThis Anglicised NIV Bible in One Year app has been developed in the UK by Aimer Media in collaboration with Hodder & Stoughton. Due to the terms of Hodder’s NIV license, the app cannot be purchased in the USA or Canada. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nDAVID SUCHET\nDavid Suchet CBE is an acclaimed British actor. He has enjoyed great success with the RSC and in London's West End.

Indeed, even native speakers often have difficulties in determining the correct pronunciation for a name written in kanji, or guessing the kanji for a name written in Latin characters. In extreme cases, one kanji name can be pronounced 36 ways, whereas one romanized name can be written in more than 100 ways.\n\nQ: Do  you know how to read the name 一二三 and 海? \nA: Kirara and Marin.\n\nQ: Do you know to write in kanji the surname Hashizume? \nA: Here some possibilities: 橋詰, 橋爪, 橋都 and 橋誥.\n\nQ: Do you know how many different ways there are of writing Akiko? \nA: At least 168! Here are just a few: 明子, 晶子, 昭子, 彰子, 亜喜子, 亜希子, 安貴子 and many more.\n\nCJKI's Japanese Names Dictionary is a based on the CJK Dictionary Institute's comprehensive collections of millions of Japanese names and their variants -- the largest such repository in existence. The subset provided here consists of the most common 500,000 Japanese surnames and given names, accompanied by their hiragana readings, and over 800,000 of the most popular romanized variants, as well as frequency of use statistics.  \n\nDistinctive Features\n---------------------------------\n* Comprehensive coverage approx. 500,000 core names with over 800,000 romanized variants selected on the basis of frequency statistics.\n* Over 1.5 million indexed romanized names, allowing for a variety of romanized forms, including relatively rare ones.\n* Radical index with all radical variants for quick access for names of unknown pronunciation.\n* Enables finding the kanji version corresponding to any of the numerous romanized variants. For example, Jun'ichirō, which can be written in kanji in at least 87 ways such as 純一郎,  潤一朗 and 凖市郎, and has at least 168 romanized variants such as Jun'ichiro, Junichiroo, Junichirou, Junichiroh, and Zyun'itirô.\n* Bilingual bidrectional: English-Japanese and Japanese-English bundled in one application.\n* Designed for easy use by both Japanese and non-Japanese users alike. \n* User interface of superb design ensures maximum ease of use.\n* Bilingual interface: user interface in Japanese and English.\n* No Internet connection required.\n* History and Bookmarks\n\nABOUT CJKI\nThe CJK Dictionary Institute is directed by Jack Halpern, editor of the New Japanese-English Character Dictionary and The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary, now standard reference works.\n\nBe sure to check out our other dictionary apps available for the iPhone (search for \"cjki\")."

Instead of trying to cram hundreds of pages of information into a cluttered and messy interface, I designed Vimmy to be a quick and easy to use companion for the average Vi/Vim user. The colorful interface is intuitive and simple, and is divided into easy to navigate categories like \"Moving Around\", \"Entering Text\", \"Search and Replace\", etc. If you see something you'd like added, email me and I'd be happy to accommodate your request."

Many species are represented with multiple call examples showing the full range of vocalizations.\n● The ability to compare any two images, maps, or sounds, side by side on the screen. The ability to filter by geographic location, so that you see only the species likely to occur in your location, and to further reduce the possibilities to usual or vagrant species in the selected area.\n● A “Smart Search” that gives the ability to search by distinguishing features such as size, colour, physical features, habitat and exclude certain types of birds (eg. Passerines).\n● A basic personal species list that stores your sightings saved to the device* (ability to upload list coming soon)\n● A comprehensive help and introduction section to help you if you get stuck or don’t understand how a certain feature works.\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling the program will result in the loss of your list, it is recommended that you keep your own backup (master list) separate from the application.\n\nWe invite all users to share their comments and ideas on our forum at www.mydigitalearth.com \n\nNB. This Application WILL ONLY work on an iPhone or iPod Touch running iOS V7.1 or higher NOT A NORMAL IPOD CLASSIC/NANO and the download is about 320MB."

God is a God of order as evidenced in His works of creation and redemption. Consequently, order belongs to the essence of His church. Order is achieved through principles and regulations that guide the Church in its internal operations and in fulfillmenting its mission to the world. In order for it to be a successful ecclesiastical organization at the service of the Lord and humanity, it needs order, rule, and discipline. Scripture affirms that “all things be done decently and in order” (1 Cor. 14:40)."

It has recently been updated to reflect the new Sentencing Code.\n\nIt's a searchable database of offences, providing quick access to key details:\n- maximum sentence\n- mode of trial (including grave crimes)\n- sentencing guidelines\n- statutory provision\n- statutory alternative offences\n- page references to Archbold and Blackstones\n- mandatory minimum sentences\n- dangerousness provisions\n- obligatory/discretionary driving disqualifications and endorsements\n- availability of SHPOs, SCPOs, Unduly Lenient Sentence referrals, SOA Notification Requirements, and POCA\n\nQuickly identify the statutory provision, maximum sentence, mode of trial, and Archbold/Blackstone's page reference.\n\nAll of the common indictable-only, triable-either-way, and summary-only offences are covered in the App.\n\nWhere applicable, access the live Magistrates' Court and Crown Court Sentencing Guidelines for an offence with a single tap.\n\nAny special provisions applicable to the offence are flagged up - for example, easily see if there is a mandatory-minimum sentence, if the offence requires a consideration of 'dangerousness', or if the offence attracts Notification Requirements.\n\nDeveloped by Sam Willis, a barrister at 5 King's Bench Walk."

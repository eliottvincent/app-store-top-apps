      "label": "Do you love polework but have run out of ideas how to use your poles? Are you looking to engage your horse’s brain as well as their body in a fun and beneficial way? Do you get bored in the arena and need to help finding new ways to keep both you and your horse entertained?\n\nIf the answer is yes to any of the above then you need the Polework Patterns App by Fancy Footwork Equestrian  in your life! \n\nThis app includes 40 different layouts (20 main and 20 random) which are designed to be multi directional and use between one and twenty poles. There are several unique features including:\n\n- the option to search for layouts based on the amount of poles you want to use:\n   • 1–5 poles\n   • 6–10 poles \n   • 11–15 poles \n   • 16–20 poles \n\n- the option to search for exercises based on what area of a horse’s development you want to focus on – here you will find 15 categories including \n   • Balance \n   • Core \n   • Engagement \n   • Response to rider \n   • ... and more!\n\n- a random button which can be used if you can’t decide which layout to go for, or if you like to live a little dangerously! Either way press that random button, watch the poles spin, the confetti fall and then marvel as your layout is revealed! \n\n- all of the layouts have different suggested exercises to use (four options for the main layouts and two options for the random layouts), each of which are colour-coded to show which pace to use, and a proposed difficulty rating attached to help you decide if that exercise is suitable to your horse’s stage of training.\n\n- 120 potential exercises with four suggestions given per exercise as to what areas it could help your horse improve on. (Flexibility, straightness etc) \n\n- a “Favourites” folder where you can add any of the 80 exercises used in the main layouts for quick and easy access.\n\nPolework patterns was developed by the creator of Fancy Footwork Equestrian, Nina Gill. Nina is a qualified coach who runs Polework clinics full-time and is passionate about her work and the many benefits of polework. This passion has led to Fancy Footwork Equestrian collaborating with some of the U.K.’s biggest equestrian YouTubers and influencers, as well as having Polework training articles printed in three of the biggest equine magazines to date. \nWith this app you will never run out of Polework ideas, even the biggest layouts have been designed to be broken down into smaller sections so that those sections can be used as a standalone layout if you don’t have enough poles to build the whole thing."

      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

New for 2022 and Exclusive to the App this new list of killer climbs will take you to roads and places you would not believe exist. Added to the climbs from the original 100 Climbs book, Another 100 climbs and the 8 regional British guides when a new book’s content is added its colour coded disc appears on your home screen displaying your score for that region so you can now track your progress across each separate area in your quest to ‘Ride them all’.\n Complete with all the content from the best selling books and utilizing your phone’s GPS you will now be better equipped than ever to locate the greatest climbs from the Scottish Highlands all the way down to Cornwall. Once you sync with your Strava Subscriber account* and your ride history has been processed your home screen will proudly display not only your ‘100 Climbs score’, but the scores across all ten titles. Below the red disc the home screen will now display a total of ten discs and of course, the bigger the numbers inside them, the bigger your bragging rights!  \nExploring the App you will see that via the interactive map you can locate and be instantly directed to the base of each climb and be taken to it’s factfile. In the factfile you will see the climb’s vital statistics together with comprehensive directions and a profile. Strava Subscribers will also see a link to your previous efforts and the ability to view it on Strava. Alternatively you can scroll the list which can be sorted by difficulty, geographically, by ridden, or best of all, by which is nearest to your current location. So no matter were you find yourself, if you have your bike and you can spare the time you can head straight to the nearest climb on the list and bag it.\n \nI hope you enjoy the App and it helps you complete the task, have a great time in the hills, Simon and Stuart.\n \n*Strava Subscriber account required for automatic sync.

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

      "label": "Avy savvy backcountry skiers and riders know that three things count when it comes to the terrain’s influence on avalanches: the slope, the elevation, and the (compass) aspect. And the Avalanche Inclinometer delivers all three. Sure, you can find plenty of inclinometer apps (also known as clinometers) that are designed for carpenters, but Steve's Avalanche Inclinometer is meant for people who spend time in avalanche terrain. \n\nThis app shows the slope, elevation, and aspect in BIG FONTS which are perfect for tired eyes in stormy (or bright-and-too-sunny) weather. And it doesn’t display a gaggle of tiny buttons and widgets to decipher when you should be skiing.\n\nYou can sight across a slope by holding your phone parallel to the slope, or you can sight up or down a slope by sighting along the long-edge of your phone like a gunsight. (Through-the-camera sighting is nifty when the light is just right, but it often isn't.)\n\nWhen you have your phone aligned with the slope, a single tap on the screen will lock the data so you can read it. The Avalanche Inclinometer will even speak to you as you’re measuring the steepness so you won’t need to look at the screen. And the BIG inclinometer dial changes colors based on the slope which provides instant feedback on how the steepness of the terrain is contributing to the likelihood of an avalanche.\n\nAfter measuring the slope, you can tap a single button to share your current GPS location, the slope in degrees, and the elevation. The email includes kml and gpx waypoint files, and a link that will let you quickly see the location in any browser. You can enter the email address one time and the Avalanche Inclinometer will remember it for next time. Less typing; more skiing.\n\nThe Avalanche Inclinometer isn’t free, but apps don’t grow on trees. To buy this app you’ll spend less than buying a beer at a ski resort—think of it as buying Steve a beer!\n\nIn addition to the Avalanche Inclinometer, it is important that you take an avy class, pay attention to the avalanche red flags, use good route finding techniques, and practice your avalanche rescue skills frequently"

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Have you ever wanted to maintain your bike yourself? \n\nBike Doctor 2.0 has been created to make bicycle maintenance as simple as possible. \n\nNot everyone is a technically minded bike mechanic. Sometimes, reading the instructions for a bike repair, it can feel that way. That's why we've designed Bike Doctor to be as easy to follow as possible. Making it suitable even for a complete beginner. It is an app I wish I had available to me, when I first started cycling. \n\nUsing the step by step instructions you will: \n◆ Save money on bike shop repairs (Even a simple puncture repair in a bike shop costs upwards of $15) \n◆ Know how to detect problems \n◆ Repair any issues that arise, such as squeaks and poor performance \n◆ Learn how to safety check your bike to be sure it is always ready to ride \n◆ Keep your bike running smoothly for years to come \n\nInside the Bike Doctor app you'll discover: \n◆ How to repair and prevent punctures \n◆ How to detect if your brake pads are worn out and replace them (Including Disk Brakes) \n◆ How to clean your bike \n◆ How to lubricate your bike \n◆ The 7 rookie bicycle maintenance mistakes you should avoid \n◆ How to adjust your headset \n◆ How to wrap handlebar tape \n◆ How to adjust your gears \n◆ How to true a bicycle wheel \n◆ How to fit a new chain and rear cassette(A very common yearly repair!) \n◆ How to bleed disk brakes \n◆ How to remove and replace a bottom bracket \n◆ How to replace brake and gear cables \n◆ And that's just scratching the surface! We've got all the most common repairs in the app and we're constantly asking for feedback from users of our app to discover what repairs they would like added - and then adding these in. \n\nBike Doctor 2.0 is the new version of the original best-selling Bike Doctor. The original version has been downloaded over 10,000 times and received coverage in some of the most popular cycling magazines including Bicycling and Cycling Plus. \n\nThe Bicycle is the ultimate in independence - learn how to keep yours maintained and in tip-top condition to insure it is always ready to get you to your destination! \n\nHere are some of the many 5 star reviews we've received: \n\"I'm over the moon with this app I read somewhere about truing wheels and it said don't bother unless you are a pro, but I've just sorted my wheels out a treat. The app paid for itself straight away.\" \n\"Great app, worth every penny saved money on a service already !!!!\" \n\"This is a good App for the keen cyclist, as a Cytech technician I recommend this App.\" \n\"Excellent application with some nice clear photos. Explanations are concise but personal, the writer has a passion for cycling and it shows, which makes for a refreshing experience.\" \n\"Very comprehensive explanations, great photos, easy to use.\" \n\nBike Doctor has been created by Andreas Kambanis of London's most popular cycling blog: londoncyclist.co.uk. \n\nFor a video of the Bike Doctor App in action please head to bikedoctorapp.com"

      "label": "Measuring your car's torque and horsepower has never been easier, now that you can do it with the help of your mobile device and this digital Dyno. You just need to open your datalog of a pull, and Log Dyno will do the rest. \n\nYou can send your CSV file from your email, browser, or any app to Log Dyno which will Open the datalog from the app right away and give you a measurement, or you can save your CSV file to the Log Dyno folder in your Files app, for easy access from the in-app file browser.\n\nYou can use any CSV or MSL file that contains RPM data which is needed to accurately measure Horsepower and Torque.\n\nFrom the torque curve and gear ratios, the app will also recommend optimal gear shift points for each gear to ensure maximum acceleration. This makes sure you know when to shift, so you always have the most possible power at the wheels.\n\nCorrections:\n●\tUncorrected\n●\tSAE J1349\n●\tSTD\n●\tDIN 70020\n●\tISO 1585\n\nPower Units:\n●\tWHP\n●\tBHP\n●\tPS\n●\tKW\n\nTorque Units:\n●\tLB-FT\n●\tNM\nEither at the wheels or at the crank\n\nCompare multiple measurements!\n\nYou can save each one of your Dyno measurements, and compare them, or just analyze them interactively.\n\nWhat datalog files can be used?\n\n●\tJB4\n●\tMHD\n●\tProTool\n●\tCOBB\n●\tMegaSquirt\n●\tProTool\n●      Bootmod3\n●\tand any other CSV file\n\nThis is the easiest way to have your torque and horsepower measured with a virtual dyno using only your mobile phone and your datalog. You can see if your mods or tune work right away, and compare them.\n\nLog Dyno has been compared to multiple real life dyno sheets, and measurements were spot on, with multiple different vehicles\n\nHow does it work?\n\n#1. Datalog your vehicle\nTake the log just like a dyno pull, in one given gear, from low rpm to high rpm. Try to avoid wheelspin as it can cause spikes in the graph.\n\n#2. Set up your vehicle data\n\nThe dyno app requires some data about your vehicle. You’ll be asked to set values for the following:\n\n●\tCar Name\n●\tWeight\n●\tTank Capacity\n●\tTire Size\n●\tDT%\n●\tDrag Coefficient\n●\tFrontal Area\n\n#3. Share the results!\n\nYou can share your results right from the virtual dyno measurement page to basically any app or post it to any social network or email it. Of course, you can just save the results in your phone gallery too.\n\nHow accurate is the dyno measurement?\n\nIf you have set your vehicle data correctly, the results our dyno app gives will be the same as the results a real dyno will give you. Also, keep in mind that wheelspin may result in spikes in the graph. If you are unable to avoid it, you’ll still get accurate results, you just need to ignore the spikes.\n\nThe best thing about our dyno app is that you can see right away how your mods work after datalogging.\nNow, you don't have to go to the dyno if you want to measure any small modification or just never had your car's power measured. You can see right away how your mods or tune work after datalogging. You can dyno unlimited times and unlimited vehicles for the fraction of the price of a dyno measurement.\n\nYou have to set your car up, how much it weighs, its tire size, the gear ratios, and also what your car drag coefficient and frontal area are, which the app will help in determining.\n\nAfter specifying for which gear you had the datalog taken and specifying the driver, passenger, and possible cargo weight, you can open the CSV or MSL file.\n\nBased on your car data and environmental values, the app generates a torque and horsepower curve, which you can analyze. The app also points out the peak values, and you will be able to see at what rpm you made the most torque and the most power.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to send an email: profisoftgames@gmail.com"

      "label": "The Bicycle Maintenance Guide differs to other repair apps on the AppStore because it is one of the only apps to be packed with quality video content. Most other apps just content text and images.\n\nThe Bicycle Maintenance Guide app is unique and differs to other content found online, such as YouTube and Parktool, because the majority of the apps content can be found and accessed with no internet connection. This means you can use the app to help repair your bike even when you're out in the sticks with no internet connection, to get you home or to your local bike shop. \n\nThe app is the most expansive bicycle repair guide in the App Store with over 100 sections, 60 professionally filmed videos containing over 7.5 hours of footage, 180+ high resolution images and over 50,000 words. \n\nThe Bicycle Maintenance Guide app is a complete guide to bicycle repairs, shown and instructed by two world class bike mechanics - Mike Rawson and Chuck Buckley.\nMike is a Senior Service Technician at a top end bicycle company and was a Team GB Mechanic for 7 years, where he covered the Olympic Games, World Championships and European Cycling Tours.\nChuck was a Head Mechanic of a UK professional cycling team for a long period before returning to NZ where he now owns and runs a bike shop.\n\nThe app is broken up into 5 areas, these are:-\n\nREPAIRS\n• Exclusive access to our private YouTube channel featuring 60 professionally shot HD video tutorials. These videos are not available on-line without this app.\n• Each video tutorial is backed up with a list of tools required and fully presented step by step instructions with hi-resolution photographs.\n• Comprehensive written tutorials backed up with high quality imagery to illustrate how to perform your own repairs\n\nAT THE ROADSIDE\n• An additional 8 video tutorials which can be viewed in an emergency whilst out riding.\n• A unique feature with ‘get out of jail’ tricks that will get the rider home after a major breakdown at the roadside. One video shows how to use a £5 note to repair a torn tyre.\n• Each of these videos also backed up with a list of tools required and fully presented step by step instructions with hi-resolution photographs.\n\nCOMPONENTS\n• Annotated and clearly labelled hi-resolution photographs of each component on a bicycle. By fully explaining what each part does, the user will have a fuller understanding of the components, giving them the confidence to adjust and maintain that part.\n\nFAULT DIAGNOSTICS\n• Easy to follow steps to help diagnose and remedy those common problems with your bicycle.\n\nSERVICING\n• Exclusive servicing guide written by Chuck Buckley encompassing weekly, monthly and annual servicing of your bicycle.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n• Links to our social media pages and website.\n• Link to email us with any questions or offer your feedback. We are always looking at ways to improve.\n• Simply and fully explained instructions in plain English for both casual and serious riders alike.\n\nNB.

      "label": "This iPhone and iPod Touch app allows any archer to keep track of their most important shooting data, including: \n\n- Round Scores \n- Sight Marks \n- Personal Bests \n\nKeep track of your Round scores, while you shoot, so that you always have your scoresheet data to hand for later analysis. Choose to shoot Indoor and Outdoor Metric or Imperial rounds, or create your own custom practice or club rounds. \n\nEnter your arrow scores for each end, and iArcher automatically totals your ends, dozens, running total, distance totals and round total, as well as telling you what classification you have achieved, and the score required for the next one. Once the round is complete, iArcher will now calculate the handicap that was achieved too.\n\niArcher lets you score a round for yourself and up to 3 guest archers - ideal for competition shoots. Any guest archer's details are saved for easy selection during future shoots. \n\nYou can also add notes to each round you shoot, allowing you to record event information, weather conditions, arrows used, bow set-up and any other notes. Rounds can also be flagged as Competition shoots. \n\nEach scoresheet is saved for loading and viewing at a later date. \n\niArcher allows you to enter your existing Personal Bests, and if you shoot a new PB, iArcher will tell you and record it, with a link to the saved scoresheet for easy viewing. Personal Bests are recorded with the bow type used, so you if you shoot different bow styles, you can track PBs for each bow style separately.\n\niArcher also allows you to record your Sight Marks, for Metric and Imperial distances, including sight bar (in/out) and sight pin (up/down) positions. Sight Marks are accessible directly from within the score sheet, so that you can change your sight accordingly when changing distance mid-round. iArcher even asks you if you want to view the sight marks when it detects a change in distance. iArcher also supports multiple groups of Sight Marks, to cater for different bow set-ups or arrows sets etc.\n\nA new Round Details screen allows you to see the details of any supported round, including the different distances, target faces types, end size and scoring types. It also lists the different classification scores for the round based on selected bow type, gender and age group.\n\nShot rounds, sight marks and personal bests can also be exported from iArcher via email, in CSV format, for backup and further analysis on your desktop platform. iTunes File Sharing is also enabled, allowing you to copy off all of the important iArcher documents, so that you can restore your scoresheets/personal bests/sight marks onto existing or new devices should you need to. For details of which files to save, see the iArcher website. \n\niArcher contains most of the recognised Archery GB, World Archery and NFAA target rounds. For a full list of the supported rounds, please see the iArcher website (URL below). \n\n=== Any issues or questions, PLEASE email me on ===\n=== iArcherSupport@joolsmail.co.uk rather than ===\n=== leave a negative review - I'll gladly help you! ===\n\niArcher has been tested with iPhone OS 11.4 and above\n\nNOTE: The minimum iOS version supported is now 11.4 in line with the most recent development tools. You must have iOS 11.4 or higher for this version of the app to work."

Set the app to notify you to send you a notice as each chair opens, like a best friend standing in line who calls you when loading begins.\n\nIn addition to the up-to-the-minute lift status, PowDay also provides temperature information, and even live WebCam images so you'll be able to check the visibility from the top of the Peak chair on those cloudy days. \n\nIf you have a Hairfarmers addiction, PowDay keeps you updated on where they are playing for Après Ski."

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. If more accuracy is needed, a portable weather station can also be used. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet, in this case user has to give the weather data manually.\n\n• For each carburetor configuration, the following values are given: main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve size, spark plug\n• Fine tuning for all these values\n• History of all your jetting setups\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (gasoline with or without ethanol, Racing fuels available, for example: VP C12, VP 110, VP MRX02)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg atm for pressures\n\nValid for the following 2T models from 1989 to 2022:\n\n• RM60\n• RM65\n• RM80\n• RM85\n• RM100\n• RM112\n• RM125\n• RM250\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve, spark plug are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs.\n  This tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all this values to adapt to the concrete engine.\n    Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too.\n On this tab, you can also share your settings with your colleagues, or add  settings to your favorites.\n  You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of air and fuel (lambda).\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all carburetor setups. If you change the weather, or engine setup, or fine tuning, the new setup will be saved in history.\n  This tab also contains your favorite settings.\n\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, year, spark manufacturer, fuel type, oil mix ratio.\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. You can see if it is available on your device and turn it on or off.\n  Also, on this tab, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place.\n  Moreover, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us.

      "label": "This app using data about your current chassis setup, cold and hot tyre pressures, tyre temperatures, behaviour in corners, weather and race track conditions will give you some recommendations about how to adjust your chassis in order to resolve any set up problem which you have. For each advice, you'll find an explanation about the adjustment. Each explanation contains pictures to be more understandable\n\nThe application is valid for all types of karts and for all karting classes (senior, cadet, junior). It's usefull for experienced or novice drivers. For experienced it'll be a second opinion about what's wrong with the chassis setup, and for novices it will teach them the secrets of the chassis adjustments and chassis setup\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Chassis: on this tab, you can enter data on the configuration of your go-kart chassis, tires, location, weather, engine, gearbox, driver and ballast.\nFor example:\n- front and rear height\n- front and rear width\n- front and rear hub length\n- front hub spacers\n- front and rear torsion bars\n- Toe In / Toe Out\n- Ackerman\n- Camber\n- Caster\n- front and rear bumpers state\n- rear axle stiffnes\n- rear bearings\n- sidepods state\n- 4th torsion bar\n- struts of seat\n- rain meister\n- seat type\n- seat size\n- seat position\n- tyre type\n- material of wheels\n- driver weight\n- ballast positions and weight\n- and more...\n\n• History: this tab contains the history of all your settings of go-cart chassis. If you something in your chassis setup or change the weather, race track, conditions - new settings data automatically will be saved in the history\n\n• Analysis: this tab contains three types of chassis behavior analysis\n\n- Driving analysis: you'll have to inform about how the driver feels the behaviour of the kart in corners. In section \"Behaviour in corners\" you'll have to enter information about what the driver is feeling of a go-kart chassis behavior (for example - understeering at entry of corners). These are the most important information used by the application to calculate the advices. You also should enter information about race track is clockwise or anti-clockwise, current weather and race-track conditions (automatic weather detection via the Internet is available). All elements are taking into consideration for calculations\n\n- Pressure analysis: you have to inform about the hot and cold pressures of each tyre, matherial of wheels (aluminium or magnesium), target tyre temperature, current weather and race-track conditions\n\n- Temperature analysis: you have to set in this screen the information about hot tyre temperatures in the inside, middle and outside of the patch of each tyre, matherial of wheels (aluminium or magnesium), target tyre temperature, current weather and race-track conditions\n\n- Temperature: you can set in this screen the information about hot tyre temperatures in the inside, middle and outside of the working surface\n\nThen click on the \"Analysis\" button and application will show you some recommendations related on which adjustments you can do to solve any problem in the chassis setup that you can be suffering. A screen with detailed information about the adjustment will be shown. For example: \"Insrease front track width\" or \"Modify tyres pressures\" (how much you should adjust your pressures) or change your driving style\n\n• Tools: on this tab, you can find useful karting utilities. Fuel calculator, for perfect fuel mixing. Weight and balance to get the perfect go-kart weight distribution. Air density and density altitude for carburetor setup (JETTING). And much more.\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, PSI and BAR for pressures, lb and kg for weights, millimeters and inches for length, mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg for atmospheric pressure, meters and foots for altitude, gallons, oz, ml and liters for volume."

As the perfect mum or dad watching all your kids' Ice Hockey games, be the one setting the ambiance for the team AND being where the heater is! Talk to the scoreboard guru and offer to play music during the games. Nothing simpler, get the app, setup your playlist with the perfect start time for each song, and plug your phone to the rink's audio system. That's it! All the kids will vote for you to play at all the games now. You will see, the time at the rink will fly and you will be looking forward to the next game like never before and you will never freeze again. I wrote that app for my son, it changed the way I see rinks now. The team was even convincing home teams we were visiting to let me play music for the travel games!   \n\nThis is the perfect Dad's app for Ice Hockey Entertainment music management and playlist. Play Pump up Songs, Face Off, and Crowd Power Up to cheer up for your team. \n\n24 songs included in this version of the app. These songs by Audionautix and Kevin MacLeod are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution license. The 36 buttons of the app can be reprogrammed with any of your own songs from your iTunes library. (Horns, Organs, ...). \n\nThe latest addition is a full screen of your best team teams' Horns! It comes included! If I am missing your favorite team, contact me on instagram @HockeyDJApp.\n\n12 suggested links to iTunes titles which will pump up your kid's team.\n\nEvery button is customizable and can be set to point to the songs you own in your iTunes Local Library (No need for iTunes Cloud Subscription). You can purchase more screens if you want, up to 15 extra screens giving you a total of 216 customizable buttons.\n\nThe cool thing about the buttons is that you can set you own starting time per song, placing the play button at the best moment of the song to have a maximum effect on your DJ skills and for the please of the parents and players at the rink.\n\nThe \"Horn\" and \"1min Left in the game\" buttons are also customizable, and now you can recall the previous song after playing a goal announcement.\n\nVia InApp purchase, you can record your own voice for quick announcements and set on the \"1min Left Button\" (or on any other buttons).\n\nWith additional inApp purchases, you can play announcements for Penalties, by selecting : The voice, the player, the team, the time and type of penalty. Then you just need to press the ready and play button. With version 5.0 and above, you can also record player roster names. This will be played on demand when you announce penalties. You can even use it to record your own announcements and play them on the rink speakers as you would play any songs from the app.\n\nDisclaimer : Copyrighted songs (120 suggested) are not included in the Apps. This latest version will let you use your iTunes Cloud Music Subscription to select your songs. From the Settings screen, you can find a button to pre-load each screen with specific startup time for each song."

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "Historic, Classic, or Vintage road rallies may permit digital dual odometers, clocks, and stopwatches. This app combines all three using timers and GPS devices built into Apple mobile devices.\n\nGPS inputs are used strictly for distance measures along the rally route. Also, the displayed accuracy of two decimal places conforms to typical historic, classic, and vintage road rally restrictions. \n\nHowever, it is possible to interpolate distance to three decimal places. There are tick marks to indicate the second decimal place number centered on the display as well as increments of +0.0025, +0.0050, and +0.0075. When touched, the Control button will pause the two odometers for 4 seconds to allow you time to estimate distance to thousandths.\n\nSimilarly, time measurements are limited to whole seconds or cents. Time, distance, and mode (discussed below) may be chosen at the start of a new rally by touching the Set button to access app Settings.\n\nA set of buttons allows you to chose the active odometer. The leftmost button activates the lower \"interval distance\" odometer; the rightmost button activates the upper \"total distance\" odometer; the center button activates both odometers.\n\nFrom time to time you may measure time and distance for a stage or a checkpoint and record data by touching the Control button. The time and distance will be stored in a log along with geographic coordinates.\n\nDistance options include subtraction of distance when you travel off course. Direction buttons switch between forward (+), reverse (–), and park (0). Also, you may chose between miles or kilometers.\n\nThere are three modes of operation selectable in the app Settings: Regularity mode, Jogularity mode, and Lap mode. In Regularity mode, the stopwatch will be reset to zero each time the Control button is pressed. In Jogularity mode the time split will be recorded but the stopwatch will continue recording. In Lap mode, the tabular display will reset the stopwatch to zero when the control button relabeled Lap Reset is touched and each split time will be identified as a Lap in the table. Also, in Lap mode, the options to zero either of the odometers are removed, however the lower odometer can be set to zero at the start of each lap by touching the Lap Reset button.\n\nNote: Use of the GPS Twin Odometers during any particular rally will be subject to the rules and instructions governing the rally and may define your category or class among participants. Please consult the Rally Master for approval of the use of this app.\n\nFor better GPS reception and improved accuracy, third-party wireless GPS receivers are recommended. This app has been tested with Bluetooth connectivity to a Dual XGPS150A GPS Receiver. This app works with both iPhones and iPads, even those without Cellular connectivity. However, there can only be one Apple device with Bluetooth activated within range of the Dual Receiver. Place devices not running this app in Airplane mode and be sure that the Dual Receiver is connected with the device and app you are using. When Dual is connected to the app, the button in the top navigation bar will show \"Dual\" in green letters, otherwise, the button will show \"Apple\" in red letters. You may have to restart your Apple device and perhaps restart the Dual Receiver once or twice to get a successful connection.\n\nDisclaimer: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

Keep up the good work” \n\nAnd here's the best bit - just find ball and this app has paid for itself! \n\n\nDownload Golf Ball Finder today, and get an edge!\n\n\n\nSECRET BOX\n\nWe are constantly looking at ways to improve and support our apps so don't keep your ideas secret let us know. \n\nMake sure that you check out our other apps: \n\n\"\"Sleep like a Baby\"\"        Achieve a better nights sleep\n\"\"Ding Dong Delivery\"\"    Paperboy's grown up\n\"\"Ziggy Kids\"\"                  Fastest racer on a mobile!\n\"\"Ziggy Road\"\"                 Flappy Bird, but in Cars\n\"\"Sugar Cubes\"\"              Minecraft + Puzzle = Sugar Cubes \n\nVisit Secret Box at www.iphonegamesapps.com"

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!

A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year. There is a 2 weeks free trial period.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to SprintTimer Pro, the purchase will be charged to your Apple ID account.

It is easy and fun to use, whilst being a powerful productivity tool for anyone involved in coaching youth soccer at any age or level.\n\nRecord key game events in real-time. These include goals, assists, shots (on and off target), saves, crosses, corner kicks, substitutions, fouls, offsides, penalty goals and misses, yellow and red cards, own goals. Playing position and formation changes can also be recorded.\n\nTrack playing time for each player and statistics for all events during a game. Overall and individual player statistics, including playing time, can be viewed and filtered by team, competition, season and opponent. Team records can be viewed for all games and similarly filtered.\n\nDirectly manipulate team line-ups and formations for maximum flexibility and ease of use. For example, during an 11-a-side game, 4-4-2 can quickly be changed to 4-3-3 simply by dragging a player from midfield to attack or alternatively to 4-5-1 by dragging a player from attack to midfield. Substitutions can be made by dragging players to and from the bench.\n\nDefine multiple competitions, each with their own game format, including the number of players and substitutes, the number of periods and their duration and whether they can go to overtime and/or a penalty shootout if the score is level. This can be overridden for individual games.\n\nRecord contact information for all players and coaches for easier communication with parents and opposing team coaches.  Link games to calendar events and their location to maps.\n\nShare information by email, SMS, Facebook and Twitter and automatically tweet game events.\n\nDefine jersey colors and styles and team logos for all teams making team identification easy. Use numbered player jerseys or photos to identify players within team line-ups.\n\nWe are committed to supporting and enhancing Soccer Teammate with the aim of making it the number one choice for youth soccer coaches everywhere.\n\nIf you encounter any problems using Soccer Teammate or have any questions or suggestions, please report them at http://www.acesportsapps.com/support.htm\n\nFeatures:\n* Manage multiple teams in multiple competitions over multiple seasons\n* Track game events (goals, assists, shots, saves, substitutions, fouls, cautions, etc)\n* Track playing time for each player, in-game, overall and by competition\n* Track formation and playing position changes \n* Track shot locations\n* Record team captain and track captaincy in each game\n* Record Player of the Game awards\n* View team and player statistics for all game events, in-game and overall\n* View all statistics by playing position\n* View team record\n* Filter games and statistics by team, competition, opponent and season\n* Directly manipulate team lines-ups, formations and substitutions\n* Link to contacts information for players, team coaches and referees\n* Link to player photos and team logos\n* Link to maps for game locations\n* Link to calendar for games\n* Share games, line-ups and statistics by email, SMS, Twitter and Facebook\n* Print games, line-ups and statistics\n* Export statistics and game events for importing into a spreadsheet\n* Create jersey styles and colors for all teams\n* Create game formats for 4-a-side to 11-a-side\n* Create starting line-ups for all teams\n* Record old games and edit game events\n* Backup, restore and transfer data between devices"

      "label": "The 'YO YO Endurance Test' provides an important instrument for determining the level of physical efficiency of an athlete.\nThe physical capacity is evaluated quickly and easily by placing two cones spaced 20 meters each other.\nThe athlete has to run at full speed from one cone to another and then return again on the first cone. This path must be repeated for six times without any break, and get  the split times every time the athlete passes on the first cone.\n\nThis application will track all the split time and at the end will be calculated two parameters that determine the outcome of the test. More these values are low and better will be the athlete's performance.\n\nBasically the final result is given by a mathematical formula that processes the delta between the averages of the last two split times and the first two split times  and thereby the athlete's ability to maintain its maximum speed for a certain period of time.\n\nThe second value obtained on completion of the test, is the first result considering also the total time of the test.\n\nThe 'YO YO Endurance Test' can be used to determine the level of athletic in all sports (football, running, basketball, volleyball, cycling, tennis etc.)\nAt the end of the test you can get for each athlete the final result (eg. \"Above average\" or \"Poor\") and the Vo2Max estimate\n\nYou can manage more Athletes and save personal data and notes.\nYou can analyze test results.\nAutomatic Sync between devices thanks to iCloud\nInfo section where you can better understand how prepare the test and you can visit linked website and video where get more info about YO-YO Endurance Test\n\nIf you find this application useful, please give a positive review in the AppStore, so we can further improve and develop new options.\n\nFor any further information, please send an email to:\nsupport@bitandweb.com\n\nThanks"

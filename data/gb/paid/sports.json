Do you get bored in the arena and need to help finding new ways to keep both you and your horse entertained?\n\nIf the answer is yes to any of the above then you need the Polework Patterns App by Fancy Footwork Equestrian  in your life! \n\nThis app includes 40 different layouts (20 main and 20 random) which are designed to be multi directional and use between one and twenty poles. There are several unique features including:\n\n- the option to search for layouts based on the amount of poles you want to use:\n   • 1–5 poles\n   • 6–10 poles \n   • 11–15 poles \n   • 16–20 poles \n\n- the option to search for exercises based on what area of a horse’s development you want to focus on – here you will find 15 categories including \n   • Balance \n   • Core \n   • Engagement \n   • Response to rider \n   • ... and more!\n\n- a random button which can be used if you can’t decide which layout to go for, or if you like to live a little dangerously! Either way press that random button, watch the poles spin, the confetti fall and then marvel as your layout is revealed! \n\n- all of the layouts have different suggested exercises to use (four options for the main layouts and two options for the random layouts), each of which are colour-coded to show which pace to use, and a proposed difficulty rating attached to help you decide if that exercise is suitable to your horse’s stage of training.\n\n- 120 potential exercises with four suggestions given per exercise as to what areas it could help your horse improve on. (Flexibility, straightness etc) \n\n- a “Favourites” folder where you can add any of the 80 exercises used in the main layouts for quick and easy access.\n\nPolework patterns was developed by the creator of Fancy Footwork Equestrian, Nina Gill. Nina is a qualified coach who runs Polework clinics full-time and is passionate about her work and the many benefits of polework. This passion has led to Fancy Footwork Equestrian collaborating with some of the U.K.’s biggest equestrian YouTubers and influencers, as well as having Polework training articles printed in three of the biggest equine magazines to date. \nWith this app you will never run out of Polework ideas, even the biggest layouts have been designed to be broken down into smaller sections so that those sections can be used as a standalone layout if you don’t have enough poles to build the whole thing."

      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

      "label": "Measuring your car's torque and horsepower has never been easier, now that you can do it with the help of your mobile device and this digital Dyno. You just need to open your datalog of a pull, and Log Dyno will do the rest. \n\nYou can send your CSV file from your email, browser, or any app to Log Dyno which will Open the datalog from the app right away and give you a measurement, or you can save your CSV file to the Log Dyno folder in your Files app, for easy access from the in-app file browser.\n\nYou can use any CSV or MSL file that contains RPM data which is needed to accurately measure Horsepower and Torque.\n\nFrom the torque curve and gear ratios, the app will also recommend optimal gear shift points for each gear to ensure maximum acceleration. This makes sure you know when to shift, so you always have the most possible power at the wheels.\n\nCorrections:\n●\tUncorrected\n●\tSAE J1349\n●\tSTD\n●\tDIN 70020\n●\tISO 1585\n\nPower Units:\n●\tWHP\n●\tBHP\n●\tPS\n●\tKW\n\nTorque Units:\n●\tLB-FT\n●\tNM\nEither at the wheels or at the crank\n\nCompare multiple measurements!\n\nYou can save each one of your Dyno measurements, and compare them, or just analyze them interactively.\n\nWhat datalog files can be used?\n\n●\tJB4\n●\tMHD\n●\tProTool\n●\tCOBB\n●\tMegaSquirt\n●\tProTool\n●      Bootmod3\n●\tand any other CSV file\n\nThis is the easiest way to have your torque and horsepower measured with a virtual dyno using only your mobile phone and your datalog. You can see if your mods or tune work right away, and compare them.\n\nLog Dyno has been compared to multiple real life dyno sheets, and measurements were spot on, with multiple different vehicles\n\nHow does it work?\n\n#1. Datalog your vehicle\nTake the log just like a dyno pull, in one given gear, from low rpm to high rpm. Try to avoid wheelspin as it can cause spikes in the graph.\n\n#2. Set up your vehicle data\n\nThe dyno app requires some data about your vehicle. You’ll be asked to set values for the following:\n\n●\tCar Name\n●\tWeight\n●\tTank Capacity\n●\tTire Size\n●\tDT%\n●\tDrag Coefficient\n●\tFrontal Area\n\n#3. Share the results!\n\nYou can share your results right from the virtual dyno measurement page to basically any app or post it to any social network or email it. Of course, you can just save the results in your phone gallery too.\n\nHow accurate is the dyno measurement?\n\nIf you have set your vehicle data correctly, the results our dyno app gives will be the same as the results a real dyno will give you. Also, keep in mind that wheelspin may result in spikes in the graph. If you are unable to avoid it, you’ll still get accurate results, you just need to ignore the spikes.\n\nThe best thing about our dyno app is that you can see right away how your mods work after datalogging.\nNow, you don't have to go to the dyno if you want to measure any small modification or just never had your car's power measured. You can see right away how your mods or tune work after datalogging. You can dyno unlimited times and unlimited vehicles for the fraction of the price of a dyno measurement.\n\nYou have to set your car up, how much it weighs, its tire size, the gear ratios, and also what your car drag coefficient and frontal area are, which the app will help in determining.\n\nAfter specifying for which gear you had the datalog taken and specifying the driver, passenger, and possible cargo weight, you can open the CSV or MSL file.\n\nBased on your car data and environmental values, the app generates a torque and horsepower curve, which you can analyze. The app also points out the peak values, and you will be able to see at what rpm you made the most torque and the most power.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to send an email: profisoftgames@gmail.com"

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method.

At the Grand Finals 2016, the cylinders for the Mini and Junior classes were updated. At the Grand Finals 2017, the cylinders for classes Max and DD2 were updated. New cylinders require richer carburation\n• Two different tuning modes: \"By regulations\" and \"Freestyle\"!\n• In first mode, the following values are given: main jet, spark plug, spark plug gap, needle type and position (including intermediate positions with washer), air screw position, idle screw position, optimal water temp, gear oil recommendation\n• In second mode (Freestyle), the following values are given: main jet, spark plug, emulsion tube, needle, needle type and position (including intermediate positions with washer), throttle valve, idle jet (outer pilot jet), idle emulsifier (inner pilot jet), air screw position\n• Fine tuning for all these values\n• History of all your carburetor setups\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (VP MS93, gasoline with or without ethanol)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Adjustable floats height\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station via Bluetooth: Kestrel DROP & 5x00, WeatherFlow WEATHERmeter, Skywatch BL\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg for pressures\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab two jetting setups are shown ('By regulation' and 'Freestyle'). These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine and track configuration given in the next tabs.\n  Also this tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all values for each carburetor config to adapt to the concrete engine.\n  Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too.\n  You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of A/F (air and fuel) or Lambda\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all jetting setups. If you change the weather, or engine setup, or fine tuning, the new setup will be saved in history\n\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, spark plug manufacturer, float type and height, fuel type, oil mix ratio and type of the track\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external services to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station.\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone\n\n\nFor Rotax Max non-EVO Engine please try our other app: Jetting Rotax Max Kart\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us. We answer every question, and we take care of all comments from our users to try to improve our software"

New for 2022 and Exclusive to the App this new list of killer climbs will take you to roads and places you would not believe exist. Added to the climbs from the original 100 Climbs book, Another 100 climbs and the 8 regional British guides when a new book’s content is added its colour coded disc appears on your home screen displaying your score for that region so you can now track your progress across each separate area in your quest to ‘Ride them all’.\n Complete with all the content from the best selling books and utilizing your phone’s GPS you will now be better equipped than ever to locate the greatest climbs from the Scottish Highlands all the way down to Cornwall. Once you sync with your Strava Subscriber account* and your ride history has been processed your home screen will proudly display not only your ‘100 Climbs score’, but the scores across all ten titles. Below the red disc the home screen will now display a total of ten discs and of course, the bigger the numbers inside them, the bigger your bragging rights!  \nExploring the App you will see that via the interactive map you can locate and be instantly directed to the base of each climb and be taken to it’s factfile. In the factfile you will see the climb’s vital statistics together with comprehensive directions and a profile. Strava Subscribers will also see a link to your previous efforts and the ability to view it on Strava. Alternatively you can scroll the list which can be sorted by difficulty, geographically, by ridden, or best of all, by which is nearest to your current location. So no matter were you find yourself, if you have your bike and you can spare the time you can head straight to the nearest climb on the list and bag it.\n \nI hope you enjoy the App and it helps you complete the task, have a great time in the hills, Simon and Stuart.\n \n*Strava Subscriber account required for automatic sync.

      "label": "Do you struggle trying to remember the checkouts for various numbers in darts?  I know I do.  What are the various checkouts that are possible?  When are there no checkouts possible.  It is all made more difficult when you only have one or two darts left.  Is there a checkout and you just cannot see it.  Some are very obscure.  There are literally tens of thousands of combinations for the checkout from 170 down to 2.  This App aims to solve these problems for you.  It has a comprehensive list of all of the possible checkouts for each starting value given the number of darts involved.  It will show you what checkouts are possible and when there are no checkouts possible.\n\nAll you have to do is provide the starting value, say 170, and then each value scored.  The starting value is adjusted for each dart entered.  When you score reaches the point where outs are possible then the table starts showing you all possible outs.  As you enter dart values the list of outs will change.\n\nFirst enter your starting value in the green field at the top of the screen.  The keyboard will be shown and you can enter any value you want.  If there are outs for that value then they will be shown in the table.  At the top of the table it will inform you of the number of outs that there are.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen are three fields that are used to enter the values for the three darts.  Select the appropriate field and using the keyboard enter the value scored.  So, if you hit treble 17 then enter 51.  This value will be subtracted from the score at the top and the outs table will be updated to reflect the new possible outs.\n\nIf you enter the value for the first dart then the table will change to show all possible outs for the new value using 2 darts.\nIf you enter the value for the second dart then the table will change to show all possible outs for the new value using 1 dart.\nWhen you enter the third dart's value the score is updated and the table is changed to show all possible outs using three darts.  The values for the darts are reset back to zero so that you can score another set of three darts.\n\nAs you enter dart information the background for that dart changes to green to show it has been entered.  \n\nDon't forget to enter zero for a dart if that is what was scored."

It automatically calculates your pressure groups and can even find your minimum surface interval. It’s quick and simple and super easy to use. \n\nTo calculate your pressure groups just enter your depth (feet or meters) and time (min) for your first dive. Then enter your surface interval between dives in minutes. After that enter your second dive depth and time the same way, and the program will calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nTo calculate your minimum surface interval between dives enter the depth and time of your first dive. Then enter the depth and time of your second dive. The program will now find your minimum surface interval and then calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nThis program uses only the standard PADI dive tables. It can NOT calculate reverse profile dives. Reverse profile dives are when the second dive is deeper than the first. Unless you absolutely know what you are doing always dive shallower than the last dive. \n\nDisclaimer: This application is not a replacement for diving tables, dive computers, or experience. Please do not rely on Ez Dive Planner as your sole dive planner and make sure to double check all information before diving.

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. If more accuracy is needed, a portable weather station can also be used. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet, in this case user has to give the weather data manually.\n\n• For each carburetor configuration, the following values are given: main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve size, spark plug\n• Fine tuning for all these values\n• History of all your carburetor configs\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (gasoline with or without ethanol, Racing fuels available, for example: VP C12, VP 110, VP MRX02)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg atm for pressures\n\nValid for the following 2T models from 2010 to 2023:\n• TC 50\n• TC 50 Mini\n• TC 65\n• TC 85\n• TC 125\n• TX 125\n• CR 125\n• CR 144\n• TC 150\n• TE 150\n• TC 250\n• TX 300\n• TE 250\n• TE 300\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve, spark plug are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs.\n  This tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all this values to adapt to the concrete engine.\n  Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too.\n On this tab, you can also share your settings with your colleagues, or add  settings to your favorites.\n  You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of air and fuel (lambda).\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all carburetor configurations. If you change the weather, or engine setup, or fine tuning, the new setup will be saved in history.\n  This tab also contains your favorite settings.\n\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, year, spark manufacturer, fuel type, oil mix ratio.\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. You can see if it is available on your device and turn it on or off.\n  Also, on this tab, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place.\n  Moreover, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us.

      "label": "-\nTop 5 in Germany / Top 1 in Sport Apps in Australia, UK and France\n-\n\nImagine seeing large, colorful fish swimming 6 meters below the surface while snorkeling at sea. Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

      "label": "Listen to your racquet and perfect your game!\n\nRacquetTune ensures that your racquet is ideally suited to your style of play. Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

You add the buttons that you need and aren’t bound by someone else’s predefined ideas of what is important to your team.\n\nFrequency statistics are displayed and data can be exported for number crunching. The time and duration of each note is recorded, allowing events to be imported into video analysis software from where valuable video coaching resources can be created.\n\nEasyTag-Note works as a standalone app but is also designed to integrate with Dartfish software. Use its Quick Import function to match tagged events to the corresponding moment on video. Now you can use Dartfish for editing, analysis and video presentations to your team.\n\nEasyTag-Note Features:\n• Create custom panels or easily modify the provided templates\n• Make your panel unique – you decide what’s important.\n• Time stamping of fixed or open duration periods of activity\n• Pre-roll setting allows you to assess an event before deciding to tag it \n• Mark favourite events for later review.\n• Export data (CSV file) via email\n• Statistics display and bar graph representation of data\n• Dartfish Quick Import easily integrates your notational analysis with video. \n\nDartfish EasyTag-Note is an iOS 10 compatible update of our Easytag app and the little brother of Dartfish Note. No myDartfish subscription is required but it has more limited functionality than both these apps. \n\nAbout us: Dartfish has a pedigree in video analysis going back to 1998. We are proud to serve teams, federations and gold medallists from all round the world."

Aimed at both coaches evaluating multiple athletes and individuals monitoring their performance, the app can be applied to a variety of different tests to measure speed, agility, jumping altitude and overall physical condition.\n\nFitnessMeter includes the following tools: \n\nFlying Sprint \nUsing the camera view, FitnessMeter measures the top speed or acceleration of a sprinter over a predetermined distance of 10-20 m. Two red lines, functioning as timing gates, aid in identifying the points between which running time is measured.\n\nSprint and Shuttle \nThis mode can be applied to both sprints and agility tests. The app functions as a starting gun and a timing gate, and can be configured to handle several different types of tests, from conventional sprint to more complex drills, such as the 505 Agility test. \n\nVertical Jump \nFitnessMeter records a short video that allows you to easily measure the height of a jump. If you are evaluating your​ performance, put the iPhone in your pocket and use the accelerometer tool instead. \n\nRepetitions \nFitnessMeter can count and time various repetitive activities such as sit-ups, push-ups, step-ups, etc. The iPhone can be placed beside you, using the camera to track repetitions using motion detection, or attached to yourself to allow monitoring through the accelerometer.\n\nBeep Test \nA configurable Beep Test that saves an image after each lap, which makes it easy to keep track of results, even for a large group of runners.\n\nSee the demo video at the support url appmaker.se/fitnessMeter\n\n\"A serious must have\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"FitnessMeter is an awesome tool\"\ngreatist.com/fitness/strength-training-iphone-apps\n\n\"Super cool app that measures a whole bunch of fitness related exercises.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com"

It doesn’t require any connection to your car. Results are provided as detailed reports featuring interactive charts.\n\nHow does PerfExpert dyno works ? It's simple :\n1. Create your car profile => Describe your car to PerfExpert by providing information such as curb weight, tire sizes or engine displacement. If you don't know how to find your car's specifications, we help you to do so.\n2. Mount your phone in your car => No need to connect your phone to your car. With your phone firmly mounted inside your car, PerfExpert can rely on its internal sensors to measure the real acceleration of your car.\n3. Accelerate through the entire engine rev range => On a flat, straight and horizontal road, perform an acceleration from low rev to the maximum rev, keeping the same gear : that's it!\n\nIMPORTANT : dyno test is not compatible with automatic gearboxes that doesn't have a manual mode.\n\nWith such a tool, you can check the efficiency of your various tunings, ECU mapping, chiptuning, and even your chassis settings.\n\nUsing the specification of the tested car and your device’s accelerometer, the application runs our algorithms and dynamic power loss calculations to provide the performances of your car with high accuracy.\n\nSkeptical? Here is a selection of comparison tests between “PerfExpert - Car Onboard Dyno” and real chassis dynos, performed by some of our users : http://bit.ly/perfexpert_vs_chassis_dyno\n\nFor further information, you can find our FAQ at https://www.perfexpert-app.com/faq\n\nHere are sample dyno and timed run reports created using the application :\nhttps://network.perfexpert-app.com/results/featured\n\nJoin now the growing PerfExpert community:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PerfExpert\n- Support : https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfexpert/\n\nFeatures:\n- Dyno test : measure the power and torque of your engine with advanced loss calculation model. Detection of the engine rev limiter. Detailed reports featuring interactive charts of wheel and engine horsepower and torque / engine speed, just like a regular chassis dynamometer.\n\n- Compute corrected power and torque using the correction norm of your choice (atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature and air humidity are taken into account). Available standards: DIN (Europe), SAE (America), JIS (Japan), CEE (Europe) and ISO (International).\n\n- Timed Run test to measure your 0-60mph, 0-60ft, 0-1/8mi, 0-1/4mi, 0-100km/h, 0-20m, 0-200m, 0-400m,  and much more.\n\n- Use of your phone accelerometer at its maximum frequency and advanced signal processing for smoothed curves.\n\n- Custom choice of units from a large choice: Hp, Ch, Cv, Kw, Nm, Ft.Lb, mKg, Mph, Km/h, m, ft, G, m/s², psi, inHg, mBar, °C, °F\n\n- Export reports in Tab Separated Value format and PNG"

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

Strengthen yourself mentally, even if there is no dartboard around!\n\nAre you standing on a 65 again and have to calculate how best to put a 40 or 32? You are already at a disadvantage because you lose concentration while arithmetic and have to start again.\nThe Darts Checkout Trainer helps you to gradually learn all common checkouts from 41 to 170 by heart.\nAnd if you prefer a different finish route than suggested by the app for a checkout, you can edit the stored checkout table at any time and save your preferred routes.\nIn a real match, you can also use the app as a checkout table! The app always shows you your current favorite checkout.\nYou can also use the app as a clear checkout table! \nMake sure to try out the widgets \"Checkout of the day\" and \"Checkout table\"!\nDo you have to write on a scoreboard at a league game again? Or are you playing on a board with a friend and there is no app available? With this app you can practice \"calculating by hand\"!\n\nIn addition to the mental training, there will be more and more practical games on the board over time. 501, Around the clock and Bob's 27 are the hottest new games. Get accurate on every single segment of the board and push your double hit rates!\n\nAnd very important: The app is optimized for both iPhones and iPads. If you hang your iPad right next to the dartboard, you will see all the displays clearly from the drop point.\n\nDon't waste any time and start your training today!"

      "label": "Keep track of your players' time on the field with Coach's Clock.\n\nDesigned with input from a youth soccer coach who manages multiple teams each season, Coach's Clock is a very simple application that runs on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. It keeps track of all of the players on your team, where they are supposed to be on the field, and how long they've been playing since they were last substituted into the game.\n\nJust enter in your team name and your player roster. Drag your players on and off the field and tap the clock to start it running. Players on the field accrue elapsed time. Players off the field do not. It's that simple.\n\nWhat Coach's Clock does:\n\n* It tracks how much time has elapsed in the current play period.\n* It tracks the position of every player on your team.\n* It keeps track of how long each player has been on the field.\n* It helps you plan player substitutions.\n* It has field backgrounds for basketball, field hockey, football, hockey and soccer but it could also be used for any similar sport.\n* It supports an unlimited number of teams.\n* It has detailed usage instructions right inside the app.\n* It's a \"universal app\" so one purchase is good for all your iDevices!\n\nWhat it doesn't do:\n\n* Coach's Clock doesn't force you to keep the app running throughout your game. You are free to close it, open other apps, take phone calls, or whatever you like. You only need to run it when you want to refer to it or when you need to make a change. The clocks keep time even when the app isn't running.\n* Coach's Clock is not a replacement for your whiteboard or playbook. (There are plenty of other fine apps which can do that for you.)\n\nCoach's Clock may seem like a pretty simple app, and it is! But that's the beauty of it. It doesn't try to do everything for you; instead it tries to do a few essential things very well. It doesn't try to change the way you coach your team; it just makes your job a little easier."

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle type and clip position, pilot jet and air screw position are shown (screw position is expressed in turns from fully tightened). These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration introduced in the next tabs. Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. The air density and density altitude are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine (you know that each engine has its own personality). \n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the model year, model and carburetor, and the oil mix ratio that you\\'re using.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures.\n\nValid for the following models from 2005 to 2021:\n- 50 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 50 SX Factory Edition: 2021.\n- 50 SX Mini: 2017-2021.\n- 65 SX: 2017-2021.\n- 85 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 105 SX: 2006-2012.\n- 125 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 125 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 125 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 125 XC: 2017-2018.\n- 144 SX: 2007-2008.\n- 150 SX: 2009-2021.\n- 150 XC: 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019.\n- 200 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 200 XC: 2005-2012.\n- 250 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 250 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 250 XC: 2007-2019.\n- 250 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 XC: 2009-2018.\n- 300 MXC: 2005.\n* Please note that the application is valid only for engines that use carburetor.

      "label": "RitmoTime Stroke Monitor is an advanced on the water training tool that any rower or paddler can use to get real-time stroke rate, speed and distance feedback during water workouts.  Every stroke of every workout is recorded and saved for later review.  RitmoTime harnesses the impressive computing power and portability of the iPhone to become the ultimate in water sport training devices.\n\nRitmoTime Stroke Monitor Free will function just like the paid version except the app must be restarted after 50 strokes.\n\n**PLEASE TRY OUR FREE VERSION \"RITMOTIME FREE STROKE MONITOR\" FIRST. TRY BEFORE YOU BUY!\n\nWith every stroke you take RitmoTime will display and record:\n- Stroke Rate\n- Heart Rate*\n- Speed*\n- Time (Total & Pieces)\n- Distance (Total & Pieces)*\n- Stroke Count (Total and Pieces)\n- Average Speed*\n- GPS Location (recorded only)*\n\nIn addition, RitmoTime will map your entire workout and display recorded data for each and every stroke for a lifetimes worth of workouts!\n\n* Speed, distance and mapping only on GPS enabled devices (iPhone or iPad/iPod touch with GPS receiver attachment purchased separately).  Heart rate feedback is available with the ANT+ Fisica Sensor Key by Wahoo Fitness or with compatible Bluetooth (BTLE) heart rate monitors.\n\nChoose from three main display types.  Choose the two easy to read and simplified Classic displays or select the customizable Espresso view.  The Espresso view  contains two touch select readouts each with a choice of twelve quantities to display.  Just tap on the touch field to choose from boat run, heart rate, stroke count, distance, heading, compass heading, remaining strokes, remaining time, remaining distance, total strokes, total time and total distance.  The “remaining” and “total” quantities are real-time estimates shown during pieces and are based on a preselected piece time, duration or distance.\n\nRitmoTime uses all three accelerometers to measure stroke rate in any orientation relative to the boat allowing for maximum flexibility when mounting.\n\nThe exclusive Auto Piece Timer feature is much more than just an “auto start” capability – it automatically starts and stops a separate piece and rest timer based on preset user stroke rates. This means hands free timing of pieces whether starting from rest or “on the fly”. No more tedious programming workout work/rest intervals.  Instead of following a scripted workout you programmed at the dock, the Auto Piece Timer follows your rowing and starts the piece/rest timer when you begin and end your piece and rest intervals.\n\nAll workout data is saved, subdivided into pieces and can be viewed on your device, in table or map format, and emailed for sharing.\n\nThe ultimate workout and race log and recorder! Because RitmoTime works in any orientation it does not need to be mounted in any particular way, it just needs to be secure from sliding or rocking. Protect it with a waterproof case, wrap it in a sweatshirt or towel and then stuff it in front of the foot stretchers. No need to interact with RitmoTime during your workout or before your race as the Auto Piece Timer will organize your data into pieces and rest for easy viewing on the device immediately after your workout.\n\nDo you have an iPod touch or iPad without GPS?  GPS can be added with a separate hardware attachment. This is a great solution for those who don’t have an iPhone. Your total cost, iPad/iPod touch + waterproof case + RitmoTime + GPS attachment, is still less expensive than almost all traditional dedicated stroke monitors that have speed and distance capability. GPS attachments from Dual and Bad-Elf have been tested by Full Compression LLC and work great.\n\n** You must use a waterproof case for this application. **\n\nWaterproof case and mounting ideas can be found at our website www.ritmotime.com."

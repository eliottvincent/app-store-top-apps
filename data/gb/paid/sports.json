These videos are not available on-line without this app.\n• Each video tutorial is backed up with a list of tools required and fully presented step by step instructions with hi-resolution photographs.\n• Comprehensive written tutorials backed up with high quality imagery to illustrate how to perform your own repairs\n\nAT THE ROADSIDE\n• An additional 8 video tutorials which can be viewed in an emergency whilst out riding.\n• A unique feature with ‘get out of jail’ tricks that will get the rider home after a major breakdown at the roadside. One video shows how to use a £5 note to repair a torn tyre.\n• Each of these videos also backed up with a list of tools required and fully presented step by step instructions with hi-resolution photographs.\n\nCOMPONENTS\n• Annotated and clearly labelled hi-resolution photographs of each component on a bicycle.

      "label": "Do you love polework but have run out of ideas how to use your poles? Are you looking to engage your horse’s brain as well as their body in a fun and beneficial way? Do you get bored in the arena and need to help finding new ways to keep both you and your horse entertained?\n\nIf the answer is yes to any of the above then you need the Polework Patterns App by Fancy Footwork Equestrian  in your life! \n\nThis app includes 40 different layouts (20 main and 20 random) which are designed to be multi directional and use between one and twenty poles. There are several unique features including:\n\n- the option to search for layouts based on the amount of poles you want to use:\n   • 1–5 poles\n   • 6–10 poles \n   • 11–15 poles \n   • 16–20 poles \n\n- the option to search for exercises based on what area of a horse’s development you want to focus on – here you will find 15 categories including \n   • Balance \n   • Core \n   • Engagement \n   • Response to rider \n   • ... and more!\n\n- a random button which can be used if you can’t decide which layout to go for, or if you like to live a little dangerously! Either way press that random button, watch the poles spin, the confetti fall and then marvel as your layout is revealed! \n\n- all of the layouts have different suggested exercises to use (four options for the main layouts and two options for the random layouts), each of which are colour-coded to show which pace to use, and a proposed difficulty rating attached to help you decide if that exercise is suitable to your horse’s stage of training.\n\n- 120 potential exercises with four suggestions given per exercise as to what areas it could help your horse improve on. (Flexibility, straightness etc) \n\n- a “Favourites” folder where you can add any of the 80 exercises used in the main layouts for quick and easy access.\n\nPolework patterns was developed by the creator of Fancy Footwork Equestrian, Nina Gill. Nina is a qualified coach who runs Polework clinics full-time and is passionate about her work and the many benefits of polework. This passion has led to Fancy Footwork Equestrian collaborating with some of the U.K.’s biggest equestrian YouTubers and influencers, as well as having Polework training articles printed in three of the biggest equine magazines to date. \nWith this app you will never run out of Polework ideas, even the biggest layouts have been designed to be broken down into smaller sections so that those sections can be used as a standalone layout if you don’t have enough poles to build the whole thing."

      "label": "Used by beginners through Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, and validated by an Independent Scientific Study by the Departments of Physics and Biomechanics at Yale University.\n\nThe Tour Tempo Total Game allows you to learn how to correctly integrate the Tempo of the Tour Pros into your golf swing. Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo.  \n\n\"In all the reviews I've written for MyGolfSpy (a number now pushing up on 100), I'd only given one perfect score. Now Tour Tempo can be added to that most-elite company. Tour Tempo is scientifically proven, it's easy to use, and it will help you in every facet of the game.\" \n— GolfSpy Matt: http://www.mygolfspy.com/tour-tempo-review\n\n\"It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.\" \n— Pat Dempsey, 2011 RE/MAX World Long Drive Grand Champion 55+\n\n\"You will get better right away! When you synch your swing to that of the Tour Pros with Tour Tempo, you’ll get better right now!\" \n— Dan Rooney, Folds of Honor\n\n\"The Unified Theory of Tempo\" \n— Golf Digest \n\n\"No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.\"\n— Travel + Leisure Golf \n\nBased on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It’s just that easy - you literally download the app, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros.\n\nLONG GAME\nThe Long Game Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18/6, 21/7, 24/8 & 27/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability.\n\nSHORT GAME\nThe Total Game App also contains the Short Game Tones of 14/7, 16/8, 18/9 & 20/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the short game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of golf is so hard to master.      \n\nTEMPO TRACKS\nThe Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine. One of the best ways to use the Tracks is to listen to them while driving to the course before a round of golf. The more you listen to them, the more the Tour Tempo rhythm will be ingrained into your Golf Swing. \n\nFOCUS TRACKS\nThe Focus Tracks are revolutionary relaxation songs that contain the Tones of Tour Tempo. Each Track has a Part II that has binaural tones embedded in the music to get your brain into an optimum state for concentration. This optimum state is more commonly known to athletes as “Being in the Zone.”\n\nVIDEOS\nThe videos give a complete explanation of the Tones and how to use them to immediately and dramatically improve your Total Game.  \n\nDISCOUNT\nThe app is your first step towards a more powerful, consistent golf game, and that is why we are giving you a discount from our Tour Tempo Shop. On the 'Info' screen you will find a one-time discount code good for $10 off on a future purchase at TourTempo.com and TourTempo.eu."

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

      "label": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year. There is a 2 weeks free trial period.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to SprintTimer Pro, the purchase will be charged to your Apple ID account. The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the period. You can manage it from the user settings in iTunes after purchasing it, and you will also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there.\n\nIf you purchase a new SprintTimer Pro subscription during a free trial you will forfeit any free trial remaining from your first subscription.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy: https://sprinttimer.se/privacy\n\n\nIcon runners made by Freepik from Flaticon.com"

The app clarifies which vessels have priority, with explanatory graphics and captions, in addition to the complete rules.   \n\nThe app is divided into the following sections:\n\nCOLREG BASICS - the key rules all sail and power boaters should learn.\nSTEERING AND SAILING RULES - illustrated guide to the correct conduct of vessels in any visibility, in sight of one another and in restricted visibility. \nNAV LIGHTS AND SHAPES - illustrated guide to the navigation lights that should be used by the different types of vessel from sunset to sunrise and the day shapes that vessels should display during daylight.\nSOUND AND LIGHT SIGNALS  - illustrated guide to the manoeuvring and warning signals, the sound signals to be used in restricted visibility and to distress signals.\nCOMPLETE COLREGS  - The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (IRPCS) are reproduced in full. \nTEST YOURSELF - A series of multiple choice quizzes with graphic representations of the rules to help test your knowledge.\n\n************ APP FEATURES and BENEFITS *******************\n- Easy reference learning and revision tool for day skipper and similar courses worldwide.\n- 160 graphics and captions for clear, accurate explanations of the rules.\n- Researched and produced by nautical and marine experts for accuracy.\n- Positively evaluated by professionals for reliability.\n- Interactive online \"Test Yourself\" Section.\n- Rules & definitions available at the touch of a finger.\n- Expertly drawn illustrations accompanied by clear, concise descriptions of the rules.\n\nAvoiding Collisions\nThe International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (Col Regs) are a globally recognised set of rules which help to stop vessels on the high seas from colliding with one another .\n\nAnyone responsible for a vessel, from a small sailing boat to an ocean going supertanker, must be able to quickly identify other vessels around them day or night, whatever the visibility. They need to be able to quickly interpret the light signals, sound signals and shapes that help identify the type and size of a vessel, the direction in which it is travelling, who has right of way, and what action should be taken to prevent a possible collision. This is not always easy, especially in crowded coastal waters and harbours. \n\nNote to U.S. users\nThe International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea apply to all vessels on the high seas. For vessels navigating the U.S. inland waters, the Inland Navigation Rules apply. The U.S. Inland Rules and the International Rules are broadly similar but there are a number of important differences. Following consultation with U.S. Coastguard officers, Safe Skipper Apps have produced the app Navigation Rules: Inland - for Boating and Sailing which explains the U.S. Inland Rules in detail."

Timing features are also found when waiting for a conversion, after adding a try to the score you are presented with a stopwatch counting up to the 90 seconds allowed!\n\nScore is really easy to manage, with a Try button, that automatically times and gives you a yes or no screen for the conversion. Penalty Kicks and Drop Goals are also easy to add through one button press.\n\nYellow Cards become even easier to manage with Rugby Ref Watch. Simply add a card, enter the number and you'll be presented with a live countdown of how long is left, as well as vibrations through the watch when the timer is up!\n\nWhether you simply want to keep time in the game, or manage the whole fixture from your wrist, Rugby Ref Watch is perfect for any referee."

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

      "label": "Keep track of your players' time on the field with Coach's Clock.\n\nDesigned with input from a youth soccer coach who manages multiple teams each season, Coach's Clock is a very simple application that runs on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. It keeps track of all of the players on your team, where they are supposed to be on the field, and how long they've been playing since they were last substituted into the game.\n\nJust enter in your team name and your player roster. Drag your players on and off the field and tap the clock to start it running. Players on the field accrue elapsed time. Players off the field do not. It's that simple.\n\nWhat Coach's Clock does:\n\n* It tracks how much time has elapsed in the current play period.\n* It tracks the position of every player on your team.\n* It keeps track of how long each player has been on the field.\n* It helps you plan player substitutions.\n* It has field backgrounds for basketball, field hockey, football, hockey and soccer but it could also be used for any similar sport.\n* It supports an unlimited number of teams.\n* It has detailed usage instructions right inside the app.\n* It's a \"universal app\" so one purchase is good for all your iDevices!\n\nWhat it doesn't do:\n\n* Coach's Clock doesn't force you to keep the app running throughout your game. You are free to close it, open other apps, take phone calls, or whatever you like. You only need to run it when you want to refer to it or when you need to make a change. The clocks keep time even when the app isn't running.\n* Coach's Clock is not a replacement for your whiteboard or playbook. (There are plenty of other fine apps which can do that for you.)\n\nCoach's Clock may seem like a pretty simple app, and it is! But that's the beauty of it. It doesn't try to do everything for you; instead it tries to do a few essential things very well. It doesn't try to change the way you coach your team; it just makes your job a little easier."

      "label": "CrewNerd turns your cell phone into an on-the-water training tool in any rowing shell, canoe, kayak or dragon boat - with no wiring! With a waterproof case, you can get real-time data during your workout and even relay it to your coach.\n\nUsing the accelerometer in your device, CrewNerd is able to accurately calculate your stroke rate as well as how much bounce (vertical movement) and stern check you are producing.  Speed, pace and distance are calculated via GPS.\n\n• Configurable display\n\nIn landscape mode there are up to six configurable data fields, and in portrait mode there are up to ten. Choose from the following:\n  • Stroke rate\n  • Elapsed time\n  • Distance\n  • Speed or pace\n  • Average speed or pace\n  • Heart rate\n  • Stroke count\n  • Interval count\n  • Meters per stroke\n  • Total distance\n  • Projected time and distance\n  • Check\n  • Bounce\n  • Course (direction)\n  • Time of day\n\nSet the top line to be double-height to make the most important data stand out. In portrait mode, the top two lines can both be made double-height.\n\n• Custom workouts\n\nSelect from one of the provided workouts, or create your own based on distance, time or strokes.  An auto-start feature starts the timer when the first stroke is taken, or you can set a “countdown” of 15 or 30 seconds before the timer starts to allow you to build up speed before starting a piece.\n\n• Custom courses\n\nCreate custom by plotting your start and finish lines on a map. The application will start the timer automatically when you cross the start line and stop when you reach the finish. This is great for hands free operation in long distance races or for set routes you routinely use.\n\n• Review your data\n\nAll workout data is recorded and can be reviewed on the device or uploaded directly to Strava, Concept2, TrainingPeaks, Sportlyzer, or the Apple Health app. On the history page for your practice, press \"Select export type\" to choose one of these options.\n\nYou can also export data as GPX, KML, TCX, or CSV. You can view a map of your workout or view an interval data chart with configurable distance markers showing split times on your phone.\n\n• Heart rate\n\nCrewNerd supports all Bluetooth Smart heart rate monitors.\n\n• Live position tracking\n\nStream your workout data as it happens to any web browser via CrewNerd.com.\n\n• VoiceOver support\n\nFor blind and vision-impaired athletes, CrewNerd provides audible feedback during your workouts. Configure the content and timing of the announcements to meet your needs.\n\n• For coaches\n\nUse custom workouts to keep your practices on target. In coach mode, you can tap anywhere on the screen to check stroke rate. CrewNerd can also be used on the iPad for a larger display.\n\nWaterproof cases are available to protect your iPhone on the water. See our web site for more information."

      "label": "Measuring your car's torque and horsepower has never been easier, now that you can do it with the help of your mobile device and this digital Dyno. You just need to open your datalog of a pull, and Log Dyno will do the rest. \n\nYou can send your CSV file from your email, browser, or any app to Log Dyno which will Open the datalog from the app right away and give you a measurement, or you can save your CSV file to the Log Dyno folder in your Files app, for easy access from the in-app file browser.\n\nYou can use any CSV or MSL file that contains RPM data which is needed to accurately measure Horsepower and Torque.\n\nFrom the torque curve and gear ratios, the app will also recommend optimal gear shift points for each gear to ensure maximum acceleration. This makes sure you know when to shift, so you always have the most possible power at the wheels.\n\nCorrections:\n●\tUncorrected\n●\tSAE J1349\n●\tSTD\n●\tDIN 70020\n●\tISO 1585\n\nPower Units:\n●\tWHP\n●\tBHP\n●\tPS\n●\tKW\n\nTorque Units:\n●\tLB-FT\n●\tNM\nEither at the wheels or at the crank\n\nCompare multiple measurements!\n\nYou can save each one of your Dyno measurements, and compare them, or just analyze them interactively.\n\nWhat datalog files can be used?\n\n●\tJB4\n●\tMHD\n●\tProTool\n●\tCOBB\n●\tMegaSquirt\n●\tProTool\n●      Bootmod3\n●\tand any other CSV file\n\nThis is the easiest way to have your torque and horsepower measured with a virtual dyno using only your mobile phone and your datalog. You can see if your mods or tune work right away, and compare them.\n\nLog Dyno has been compared to multiple real life dyno sheets, and measurements were spot on, with multiple different vehicles\n\nHow does it work?\n\n#1. Datalog your vehicle\nTake the log just like a dyno pull, in one given gear, from low rpm to high rpm. Try to avoid wheelspin as it can cause spikes in the graph.\n\n#2. Set up your vehicle data\n\nThe dyno app requires some data about your vehicle. You’ll be asked to set values for the following:\n\n●\tCar Name\n●\tWeight\n●\tTank Capacity\n●\tTire Size\n●\tDT%\n●\tDrag Coefficient\n●\tFrontal Area\n\n#3. Share the results!\n\nYou can share your results right from the virtual dyno measurement page to basically any app or post it to any social network or email it. Of course, you can just save the results in your phone gallery too.\n\nHow accurate is the dyno measurement?\n\nIf you have set your vehicle data correctly, the results our dyno app gives will be the same as the results a real dyno will give you. Also, keep in mind that wheelspin may result in spikes in the graph. If you are unable to avoid it, you’ll still get accurate results, you just need to ignore the spikes.\n\nThe best thing about our dyno app is that you can see right away how your mods work after datalogging.\nNow, you don't have to go to the dyno if you want to measure any small modification or just never had your car's power measured. You can see right away how your mods or tune work after datalogging. You can dyno unlimited times and unlimited vehicles for the fraction of the price of a dyno measurement.\n\nYou have to set your car up, how much it weighs, its tire size, the gear ratios, and also what your car drag coefficient and frontal area are, which the app will help in determining.\n\nAfter specifying for which gear you had the datalog taken and specifying the driver, passenger, and possible cargo weight, you can open the CSV or MSL file.\n\nBased on your car data and environmental values, the app generates a torque and horsepower curve, which you can analyze. The app also points out the peak values, and you will be able to see at what rpm you made the most torque and the most power.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to send an email: profisoftgames@gmail.com"

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. If more accuracy is needed, a portable weather station can also be used. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet, in this case user has to give the weather data manually.\n\n• For each carburetor configuration, the following values are given: main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve size, spark plug\n• Fine tuning for all these values\n• History of all your jetting setups\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (gasoline with or without ethanol, Racing fuels available, for example: VP C12, VP 110, VP MRX02, Sunoco)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg atm for pressures\n\nValid for the following 2T models from 1998 to 2023:\n• 50 SX\n• 50 SX Mini\n• 50 Supermoto\n• 60 SX\n• 65 SX\n• 65 XC\n• 85 SX \n• 105 SX\n• 125 SX \n• 125 SXS\n• 125 EXC\n• 125 XC-W\n• 125 MXC\n• 125 EXE\n• 125 Supermoto\n• 144 SX\n• 150 SX\n• 150 XC \n• 150 XC-W\n• 200 SX\n• 200 EXC\n• 200 XC\n• 200 MXC\n• 200 EGS\n• 200 XC-W\n• 250 SX\n• 250 SXS\n• 250 XC\n• 250 XC-W\n• 250 EXC\n• 300 EXC\n• 300 XC\n• 300 XC-W\n• 300 MXC\n• 380 SX\n• 380 EXC\n• 380 MXC\n• Freeride 250 R\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve, spark plug are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs.\n  This tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all this values to adapt to the concrete engine.\n  Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too.\n On this tab, you can also share your settings with your colleagues.\n  You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of air and fuel (lambda).\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all carburetor setups.\n  This tab also contains your favorite carburetor configs.\n\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, year, spark manufacturer, fuel type, oil mix ratio.\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. You can see if it is available on your device and turn it on or off.\n  Also, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us. We answer every question, and we take care of all comments from our users to try to improve our software. We are also users of this application."

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet\n\n• For Mini, Junior, Max, DD2 you can choose which cylinder you are using. At the Grand Finals 2016, the cylinders for the Mini and Junior classes were updated. At the Grand Finals 2017, the cylinders for classes Max and DD2 were updated. New cylinders require richer carburation\n• Two different tuning modes: \"By regulations\" and \"Freestyle\"!\n• In first mode, the following values are given: main jet, spark plug, spark plug gap, needle type and position (including intermediate positions with washer), air screw position, idle screw position, optimal water temp, gear oil recommendation\n• In second mode (Freestyle), the following values are given: main jet, spark plug, emulsion tube, needle, needle type and position (including intermediate positions with washer), throttle valve, idle jet (outer pilot jet), idle emulsifier (inner pilot jet), air screw position\n• Fine tuning for all these values\n• History of all your carburetor setups\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (VP MS93, gasoline with or without ethanol)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Adjustable floats height\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station via Bluetooth: Kestrel DROP & 5x00, WeatherFlow WEATHERmeter, Skywatch BL\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg for pressures\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab two jetting setups are shown ('By regulation' and 'Freestyle'). These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine and track configuration given in the next tabs.\n  Also this tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all values for each carburetor config to adapt to the concrete engine.\n  Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too.\n  You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of A/F (air and fuel) or Lambda\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all jetting setups. If you change the weather, or engine setup, or fine tuning, the new setup will be saved in history\n\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, spark plug manufacturer, float type and height, fuel type, oil mix ratio and type of the track\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external services to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station.\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone\n\n\nFor Rotax Max non-EVO Engine please try our other app: Jetting Rotax Max Kart\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us.

      "label": "Do you struggle trying to remember the checkouts for various numbers in darts?  I know I do.  What are the various checkouts that are possible?  When are there no checkouts possible.  It is all made more difficult when you only have one or two darts left.  Is there a checkout and you just cannot see it.  Some are very obscure.  There are literally tens of thousands of combinations for the checkout from 170 down to 2.  This App aims to solve these problems for you.  It has a comprehensive list of all of the possible checkouts for each starting value given the number of darts involved.  It will show you what checkouts are possible and when there are no checkouts possible.\n\nAll you have to do is provide the starting value, say 170, and then each value scored.  The starting value is adjusted for each dart entered.  When you score reaches the point where outs are possible then the table starts showing you all possible outs.  As you enter dart values the list of outs will change.\n\nFirst enter your starting value in the green field at the top of the screen.  The keyboard will be shown and you can enter any value you want.  If there are outs for that value then they will be shown in the table.  At the top of the table it will inform you of the number of outs that there are.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen are three fields that are used to enter the values for the three darts.  Select the appropriate field and using the keyboard enter the value scored.  So, if you hit treble 17 then enter 51.  This value will be subtracted from the score at the top and the outs table will be updated to reflect the new possible outs.\n\nIf you enter the value for the first dart then the table will change to show all possible outs for the new value using 2 darts.\nIf you enter the value for the second dart then the table will change to show all possible outs for the new value using 1 dart.\nWhen you enter the third dart's value the score is updated and the table is changed to show all possible outs using three darts.  The values for the darts are reset back to zero so that you can score another set of three darts.\n\nAs you enter dart information the background for that dart changes to green to show it has been entered.  \n\nDon't forget to enter zero for a dart if that is what was scored."

Then enter your surface interval between dives in minutes. After that enter your second dive depth and time the same way, and the program will calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nTo calculate your minimum surface interval between dives enter the depth and time of your first dive.

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. If more accuracy is needed, a portable weather station can also be used. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet, in this case user has to give the weather data manually.\n\n• For each carburetor configuration, the following values are given: main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve size, spark plug\n• Fine tuning for all these values\n• History of all your carburetor configs\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Selectable fuel type (gasoline with or without ethanol, Racing fuels available, for example: VP C12, VP 110, VP MRX02)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station\n• If you don't want to share your location, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg atm for pressures\n\nValid for the following 2T models from 2010 to 2023:\n• TC 50\n• TC 50 Mini\n• TC 65\n• TC 85\n• TC 125\n• TX 125\n• CR 125\n• CR 144\n• TC 150\n• TE 150\n• TC 250\n• TX 300\n• TE 250\n• TE 300\n\nThe application contains four tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab main jet, needle type, needle position, pilot jet, air screw position, throttle valve, spark plug are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs.\n  This tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all this values to adapt to the concrete engine.\n  Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE- relative horsepower, volumetric content of oxygen, oxygen pressure are shown too.\n On this tab, you can also share your settings with your colleagues, or add  settings to your favorites.\n  You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of air and fuel (lambda).\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all carburetor configurations. If you change the weather, or engine setup, or fine tuning, the new setup will be saved in history.\n  This tab also contains your favorite settings.\n\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model, year, spark manufacturer, fuel type, oil mix ratio.\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. You can see if it is available on your device and turn it on or off.\n  Also, on this tab, you can manually select any place in the world, the carburetor setups will be adapted for this place.\n  Moreover, on this tab, you can enable alerts about possible carburetor icing.\n\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us.

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

You add the buttons that you need and aren’t bound by someone else’s predefined ideas of what is important to your team.\n\nFrequency statistics are displayed and data can be exported for number crunching. The time and duration of each note is recorded, allowing events to be imported into video analysis software from where valuable video coaching resources can be created.\n\nEasyTag-Note works as a standalone app but is also designed to integrate with Dartfish software. Use its Quick Import function to match tagged events to the corresponding moment on video. Now you can use Dartfish for editing, analysis and video presentations to your team.\n\nEasyTag-Note Features:\n• Create custom panels or easily modify the provided templates\n• Make your panel unique – you decide what’s important.\n• Time stamping of fixed or open duration periods of activity\n• Pre-roll setting allows you to assess an event before deciding to tag it \n• Mark favourite events for later review.\n• Export data (CSV file) via email\n• Statistics display and bar graph representation of data\n• Dartfish Quick Import easily integrates your notational analysis with video. \n\nDartfish EasyTag-Note is an iOS 10 compatible update of our Easytag app and the little brother of Dartfish Note. No myDartfish subscription is required but it has more limited functionality than both these apps. \n\nAbout us: Dartfish has a pedigree in video analysis going back to 1998. We are proud to serve teams, federations and gold medallists from all round the world."

It doesn’t require any connection to your car. Results are provided as detailed reports featuring interactive charts.\n\nHow does PerfExpert dyno works ? It's simple :\n1. Create your car profile => Describe your car to PerfExpert by providing information such as curb weight, tire sizes or engine displacement. If you don't know how to find your car's specifications, we help you to do so.\n2. Mount your phone in your car => No need to connect your phone to your car. With your phone firmly mounted inside your car, PerfExpert can rely on its internal sensors to measure the real acceleration of your car.\n3. Accelerate through the entire engine rev range => On a flat, straight and horizontal road, perform an acceleration from low rev to the maximum rev, keeping the same gear : that's it!\n\nIMPORTANT : dyno test is not compatible with automatic gearboxes that doesn't have a manual mode.\n\nWith such a tool, you can check the efficiency of your various tunings, ECU mapping, chiptuning, and even your chassis settings.\n\nUsing the specification of the tested car and your device’s accelerometer, the application runs our algorithms and dynamic power loss calculations to provide the performances of your car with high accuracy.\n\nSkeptical? Here is a selection of comparison tests between “PerfExpert - Car Onboard Dyno” and real chassis dynos, performed by some of our users : http://bit.ly/perfexpert_vs_chassis_dyno\n\nFor further information, you can find our FAQ at https://www.perfexpert-app.com/faq\n\nHere are sample dyno and timed run reports created using the application :\nhttps://network.perfexpert-app.com/results/featured\n\nJoin now the growing PerfExpert community:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PerfExpert\n- Support : https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfexpert/\n\nFeatures:\n- Dyno test : measure the power and torque of your engine with advanced loss calculation model. Detection of the engine rev limiter. Detailed reports featuring interactive charts of wheel and engine horsepower and torque / engine speed, just like a regular chassis dynamometer.\n\n- Compute corrected power and torque using the correction norm of your choice (atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature and air humidity are taken into account). Available standards: DIN (Europe), SAE (America), JIS (Japan), CEE (Europe) and ISO (International).\n\n- Timed Run test to measure your 0-60mph, 0-60ft, 0-1/8mi, 0-1/4mi, 0-100km/h, 0-20m, 0-200m, 0-400m,  and much more.\n\n- Use of your phone accelerometer at its maximum frequency and advanced signal processing for smoothed curves.\n\n- Custom choice of units from a large choice: Hp, Ch, Cv, Kw, Nm, Ft.Lb, mKg, Mph, Km/h, m, ft, G, m/s², psi, inHg, mBar, °C, °F\n\n- Export reports in Tab Separated Value format and PNG"

      "label": "This app simulates the official starting sequence used in BMX racing so you can practice your starts on the go. It is specially designed to work with the iGate BMX starting gate system for easy use on a practice gate, but it can also be used as a normal light tree for users who don't have an iGate unit. \n\nFeatures:\n- Large, bright light display for riders who start using the lights\n- UCI starting cadence audio\n- Designated spot for the iGate sensor ensuring consistent gate release (can be turned on/off in settings)\n- Auto repeat\n- Adjustable start delay and brightness\n- Adjustable gate release timing\n\nWe recommend you maximize your screen brightness while using the app for best performance.\n\nThe iGate Controller Module and starting gates can be found on our website: rivalracingbmx.com"

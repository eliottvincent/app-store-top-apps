You can also use the Nearby function to find airports near you.\n\nThe LiveATC network (www.liveatc.net) is the world's largest network of streaming audio feeds focused solely on aviation-related communications, currently covering over 1,200 airports around the world with almost 3,000 different audio feeds and growing daily!\n\n*** IMPORTANT NOTICE *** \nPlease check to see if your country, city and/or airports of interest are covered by LiveATC *BEFORE PURCHASING* - check at: https://liveatc.net .  Note that we do not have coverage in the U.K., Belgium, Germany, Iceland, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and other countries where streaming ATC communications is prohibited by law. \n\nAvailable airports/channels are subject to change at any time - LiveATC owns and operates many of the receivers used in the network but many are provided by volunteers. Available airports can change due to reasons beyond our control. For this reason there is no service guarantee - and there is no guarantee that any particular channel will be up 24/7, though we make our best effort to do so and have a good track record of uptime.\n\nFollow LiveATC for feed updates and breaking aviation and ATC-related news:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/liveatc \nFacebook: https://facebook.com/liveatc"

It includes over 700 species profiles detailing physical characteristics, behaviours and locations, and each is accompanied by breathtaking photography to aid identification. The 700+ species profiles cover:\n- All 148 mammal species ever recorded in Kruger, including the best places to find them.\n- Over 60 footprint graphics so you can identify wildlife spoor.\n- 500+ bird species, including all of Kruger’s resident, migrant visitor and vagrant records since 2010.

Each includes extensive commentary that doesn’t just say, “Take that road because it’s good for lions,” but instead explains the geology of each area, which in turn informs the flora that grows there, the herbivores that eat that flora and, ultimately, the predators that hunt those herbivores.\n- Each route will help you develop an intimate insight into Kruger’s incredible wilderness.\n- Each of the rest camps and entrance gates is covered with short, medium and full-day routes to explore.\n\nThe Maps are the most detailed and up-to-date available:\n- They include newly opened roads and correct errors found in the maps available in the park shops. \n- For first-time visitors to Kruger, note that you are not provided with a map and must buy one from a park shop at a cost similar to this App.\n- The live GPS map means you'll never get lost.\n\nWith over half a million words of content, KrugerExplorer is the most comprehensive and unparalleled encyclopedia for the Greater Kruger ever created.\n\nSince launching in 2019, the App has had a superb reception from fans and received wonderful accolades:\n- Downloads in over 80 countries\n- App Store “App of the Day”\n- “Recommended” commendation by BirdLife South Africa\n- “Highly Recommended” by Getaway Magazine\n\nKrugerExplorer is also a global community of wildlife lovers. You can enjoy the stories, photos and experiences of our 200,000+ followers on Facebook & Instagram. We look forward to seeing you there!\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n- Yes, the App works 100% offline once fully downloaded. You can put your device into flight mode, escape to the bush and still make full use of the App!\n- Yes, this App is a one-time purchase, with no further in-app purchases or ongoing subscriptions required.\n- This is an English language app.\n\nHappy exploring,\nDanny & Charlotte"

Experience complete freedom and get value for your money! Use Cuba-Junky’s Casa Particular Directory app as your simple and user friendly ‘Yellow Pages’ while planning, traveling and exploring!\n\nWhy you need this app when you plan to visit Cuba \n- Cuba friendly and explorer friendly (simple, practical and cheap!)\n- Several updates a week with new casas and features \n- Even more casas in the app than on our website\n - Direct contact with the casa through the app\n - Save yourself  $5 per night by using the app to contact the owners directly  \n\nWhat are casas particulares? \nCuba’s version of B&Bs offer the island’s best lodging values for anyone who likes doing things authentically, or in this case: the Cuban way. You can find hundreds of casas in this app. They are rooms, suites, or sometimes entire apartments. The Cuba-Junky casa directory app is current, convenient, and easy to use. It provides casa photos, phone numbers, email addresses, Facebook and website links—all for about US $5!  \n\nOnline, offline and more \nBut there is more. The casa particular directory app is very frequently updated at no extra charge. And you can access other types of info through the app, such as the weather forecast, or use it to contact your casa.\n\n  No commission: save $5 per night! \nBy using this app and contacting a casa directly, you often save the $5 per night commission that the owner normally charges for bookings made through a third party. Casa owners pay no commission or other costs to Cuba Junky. Say this to the casa owner and get that discount!\n\n  Some free Cuba advice?\n Cuba-Junky’s advice is: make a reservation for your first night in Cuba and after that just “go with the flow.” Using your Cuba-Junky casa particular app, it will be easy to find casas while in Cuba, or to call ahead to a casa in the next town you plan to visit. You can talk to the owner directly, find out what’s available, and at what price.   \n\nWhy does this app cost about $5?  \nJust because Cuba Junky have to keep it running. We charge no hidden $5 per night commission. We just love Cuba. If you do too, go and enjoy it, and while you’ re at it, help us keep Cuban locals in the lead! ¡Gracias amigos!"

Only Border Control can decide if your stay is authorized or not. The app is for your consideration only. It uses '90 days/180-day rule' which is correct for the vast majority of third-country nationals. But the app has no information about additional agreements that the Member States of Schengen acquis can have with other countries."

This makes it much easier to find RV dump stations along a route you've created in another app such as Road Trip Planner.\n- Send a dump station location to our app Road Trip Planner.  This helps in routing your travels (requires separate purchase of the Road Trip Planner app).\n\nWe want to expand our RV dump station database as much as possible, so we have made it easy for you to easily submit a new RV dump station - simply tap the + button below the map.  To correct or update dump station information, tap “Location Comment” in the detail view. We will be updating the database often.\n\nDue to the nature of dump stations constantly changing their status it's recommended you contact the dump station prior to using it to verify its existence."

All makes for a GREAT #SundayMorning! #Staycation adventure to #Cornwall” - James Moyse - Journalist at Sky News\n\n\"@TrainBeacon who’s behind this app?? You’ve satisfied my nerdy needs and I am so impressed as to how slick it is. Well done”\n\n\"love the AR mode\"\n\nSafety Information\n\nNot for use in safety critical applications, level crossings, etc. Train position is estimated from latest available timing point data and may be incorrect. Care must be taken during use. Other trains may be present that are not indicated in the AR or train tracker mode of the app such as trains not stopping at the nearest station and also freight trains. Freight and non passenger trains are not displayed in the app. For your safety do not use your phone while you walk and take extreme care using the app near trains and railways.\n\nHardware requirements\n\n* AR mode and the augmented reality features of the app require iOS 13 or higher, and an iPhone 6S, SE or later device, or an iPad 2017 or later. Widgets require iOS 14 or higher *\n\nApp powered by National Rail Enquiries and contains information of Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd"

      "label": "This comprehensive guide shows you all you need to know to hike the Cape to Cape Track, which runs from Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin in the Margaret River Region of Western Australia.\n\nThis App has many innovative features that make it way more useful than a paper guidebook or a website!\n\nThe Cape to Cape Track is one of the best kept secrets in the world. If you have a chance to walk the Track, you will not be disappointed!\n\nThe App has beautiful photographs, extremely detailed information, built-in maps and GPS support. So you cannot get lost and will not miss anything.\n\nNO INTERNET OR MOBILE COVERAGE IS NEEDED to use this guide. This is very important because most of the track has no internet or mobile coverage. The excellent maps work without using any data, WiFi connection, or internet. So it's fast and won't cost you money. \n\nIt's very interactive; turn on your phone or tablet's GPS from within the App, then follow the track and you will never get lost again! Also see exactly where to park to take shorter day hikes, where to get water and food, and where the best sights, beaches and attractions are. Note that GPS works everywhere - you don't need mobile network reception for it to work.\n\nEach map is marked up to show you viewpoints, attractions, toilets, places to get water, the best beaches, where to camp and more. Tap any map marker to show much more information about that place.\n\nIt's like having your own personal tour guide in your pocket that is showing you exactly where to turn at those unmarked crossroads, and it can be quickly referenced to show you the name of the beach or town you are on or in. It is easier than using a paper guide book or a paper map and compass because you can instantly see where you are.\n\nWe suggest which way you should walk the track and give you the distances between campsites or paid (comfy!) accommodation to help you in planning your hike. \n\nFEATURES:\n- We describe beaches, sights, camping, accommodation and more\n- We give you lots of useful General Information to help you make your hike enjoyable and safe\n- We include a number of useful first-aid tips for the most common issues you may encounter on the Track\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Track to inspire you!\n- It has detailed maps of hiking trails. With the phone's GPS enabled you cannot get lost!\n- It works without the internet. So there are no data roaming charges. And mobile black spots will not stop the App from working (unlike websites and most other Apps)\n- It uses very high-resolution maps\n- It describes several other hiking tracks and day walks nearby the Cape to Cape track.\n- All information has been researched and written by a local of the Margaret River region\n- Information is presented relative to your current location, so its very easy to find where you are and how far it is to your next camping area or town for that cold beer or chilled glass of white wine\n- Has a useful search feature. For example, search for \"shower\" to list everything in the App that uses that text\n- Quick reference entries show you all of the water sources and the locations of toilets along the track. Activate the GPS to show you how far to your next one\n- The guide is simple to use\n- This App automatically keeps it's content up to date by periodically downloading updates from \"the cloud\". You don't have to do anything to make this happen."

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "You probably know where your local NHS Accident and Emergency (A&E) Hospital is, but would you be able to find one if you were in another town, away from home either on business or for leisure? \n\nAnd did you know that, depending on your urgent medical need, you may be better off attending somewhere other than A&E, possibly more local to you, and in doing so, be treated quicker as well as doing your bit to ease demand on precious and overstretched A&E services.\n\nFind Emergency Medical Help UK allows you to find NHS emergency medical locations across the United Kingdom where you can receive emergency medical treatment. \n\nThe built-in data covers the entire UK including England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.\n\nObviously, if someone is seriously ill and their life is at risk you should call 999 immediately and request an ambulance and/or a paramedic. Or, if you so choose, go straight to A&E by yourself. You will be prioritised at A&E based on medical need, not on the method of transport used to get there.\n\nHowever, if you need medical help or advice but it's not a life-threatening situation then you can call NHS 111 for free from landlines or mobiles, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You can also call 111 if you're not sure which NHS service you need. \n\nIn addition to A&E, you have a choice of Urgent Care Centres, Minor Injuries Units and Walk-in Centres that you can seek out for emergency medical help.\n\nNHS Walk-in Centres (WICs) are only found in England and offer convenient access to a range of treatments. These include:\n● infections and rashes\n● blood pressure checks\n● fractures and lacerations\n● emergency contraception and advice\n● stomach aches\n● vomiting and diarrhoea\n● hay fever\n● insect and animal bites\n● stitches (sutures)\n● dressing care\n● minor cuts and bruises\n● minor burns and strains\n● stop smoking support\n\nSome Walk-in Centres are unable to treat young children. Call ahead to check if this is the case in your instance.\n\nUrgent Care Centres (England only) and Minor Injuries Units can treat:\n\n● sprains and strains\n● broken bones\n● wound infections\n● minor burns and scalds\n● minor head injuries\n● insect and animal bites\n● minor eye injuries\n● injuries to the back, shoulder and chest\n\nIf there is not a minor injuries unit in your area, these services will also be provided by an A&E department. Some Urgent Care Centres and Minor Injuries Units are unable to treat children. Call ahead to check if this is the case in your instance.\n\nNote that Urgent Care Centres and Minor Injuries Units cannot treat:\n\n● chest pain\n● breathing difficulties\n● major injuries\n● problems usually dealt with by a GP\n● stomach pains\n● gynaecological problems\n● pregnancy problems\n● allergic reactions\n● overdoses\n● alcohol related problems\n● mental health problems\n● conditions likely to require hospital admission\n\nHow To Use The App\n\n● Use the buttons at the bottom of the map to filter location pins on and off. \n● Tap any pin to see an information balloon pop up, then tap on the balloon to see detailed information for that location.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nEvery reasonable effort has been made to ensure that the data and its content contained in this publication are correct at the time of going to press.

This NEW improved, paid version will help create more technology projects for the people of Chepstow and the surrounding areas.\nMore features are on their way for Enviroute, and we'll be adding surrounding roads / routes such as the M49 along with routes into Bristol, the M5, and more.\nIf you don't know about the original problems commuters have experienced with the Severn crossings, read on for some background...\nThe Severn bridges based between England and wales are major connections for the M4 and M48 motorways. Traditionally both crossings / bridges have been owned and operated by private companies.\n\n“Is the bridge open” and Enviroute have created an app that allows local residents and commuters to check the status of both bridges in order to plan their routes more effectively. From time to time the bridges are closed due to maintenance and/or adverse weather conditions and, since the ownership of the Severn bridges has changed there has been a lack of reliable communications around the status of the M48 Severn bridge and the M4 Severn Bridge.\n\n“Is the bridge open” is here to help with this and to provide information on when either of the Severn Bridges are closed or partially closed.\nSevern bridge updates at the touch of a button instead of endless maps, websites or twitter accounts. \nFind out instantly is the Severn Bridge is open and get updates sent directly to your device (Enviroute NEW now has this feature!) before you set off on your journey.\nBy paying for Enviroute NEW you are indirectly funding this local area for more exciting tech based projects.  We want to make life easier for residents of the surrounding areas, help local businesses sell more, save your local high-streets plus many more projects in the pipeline.  These will be funded by the money earned by Enviroute NEW\nThank you and I hope you enjoy the new version."

Street View coverage is displayed in blue.\n\n\nEASY TO USE\nWalking through panoramas has never been easier using the interactive, expandable mini map that also displays your viewing angle and field of view. Virtually traveling abroad is even more immersive and fun with Live Panorama mode: Turn around in the panorama simply by rotating the device.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH APP\nStreets is the only app capable of displaying 360° Street View panoramas on the Apple Watch. Just turn your wrist or pan to turn around in any direction. Use the digital crown to zoom. Streets for Apple Watch automatically syncs favorites and recent searches with your iPhone.\n\n\nOPEN FROM MAPS & OTHER APPS \n“Open location in Streets” displays nearby panoramas from websites, from „Maps“ or „Contacts“, or from many other apps that support sharing of locations and addresses. If you’re already using our location finder app Where To?, you’ll also be able to take advantage of a tight, bidirectional integration.\n\n\nDRAG & DROP\nOn iPad or Mac, drag a pin location from the Maps app, a contact, or a textual address into the Streets app to find nearby panoramas. Even geotagged photos can be dropped in Streets to find 360° spherical images near the photo location.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATIVE\nShare Street View panoramas using drag-and-drop (on iPad) or the share sheet. Handoff and AirDrop let you easily transfer the currently viewed panorama between multiple devices. Mark panoramas as favorites that are automatically synced between devices. Rename favorites and organize them in folders.\n\n\n2000+ GALLERY PLACES \nMore than 2000 hand-picked “Gallery Places” show spectacular places such as museums, castles, national parks, ski slopes and even underwater attractions. Geysers in Yellowstone national park, old masterpieces in Amsterdam’s van Gogh museum or NASA’s rocket launch pad in Cape Kennedy are just a few of the breathtaking places waiting to be explored. Gallery places also include background information such as descriptions and links.\n\n\n\nMORE FEATURES\n- Supports iPad Pro, Split View and Slide Over\n- Supports keyboard navigation (with Bluetooth or Smart Keyboard)\n- Spotlight search also finds Streets panoramas\n- Siri can create reminders with a link to the currently displayed panorama\n- Supports the “Shortcuts” app\n\n\nWHAT OTHERS SAY\n\n“I highly recommend Streets 3.“\n- John Voorhees, MacStories\n\n“it’s hard to imagine Cupertino doing it better than Streets 3”\n4.5/5 mice\n- J.R. Bookwalter, Macworld\n\n“If you haven't migrated to Google Maps on iOS because you're OK with Apple Maps but you miss Google Street View, here's a pretty easy solution.“\n- Mel Martin, Engadget\n\n“Thankfully, with Streets, you can continue using Maps and still be able to quickly pull up Street View without ever feeling like you’ve left the app.“\n- Jordan Khan, 9to5Mac\n\n\nTwitter & Facebook\nCheck us out on Twitter: @futuretap\nand Facebook: http://facebook.com/streetviewapp"

      "label": "No account necessary.  No hidden costs.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino del Norte from Irún to Santiago de Compostela and includes all of the alternate routes along the way. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Find your way from any its 44 car parks and discover the stories behind their unusual names too!\n\nTen walking trails will take you to all corners of the Forest: follow in the footsteps of Pooh, visit the Airman's Grave or take a Walk Amongst Friends.\n\nAshdown Forest, the largest free public access space in the South East of England, lies at the heart of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. For nearly 2000 years the Forest was also exploited for the iron industry, leading to the creation of the heathland landscape that covers two thirds of the area. Ashdown Forest is rich in history and wildlife. Use this app to start exploring.\n\nThere are no photographs, audio or video to ensure the size of this app is kept really small.\n\nThe app makes use of GPS to show you places of interest close to your current location. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Whilst this app will work on devices without GPS, such as a Wi-Fi only iPad, you may not be able to use all location features."

      "label": "Tulum – Be Your Own Guide GPS locates and navigates you anywhere within the Maya ruins of Tulum in Quintana Roo, Mexico without using any external data.  There’s no data usage for your mobile device’s automatic ability to locate satellite based cell signals, so no expensive charges apply for using the app.  Created by renowned Maya archaeologist Dr. Edwin Barnhart, the Tulum app provides detailed information about virtually every feature of the site.  The home page provides an interactive map of Tulum with each and every building clickable to reveal information regarding its construction, excavation history, and what was found inside.  The “What Is That” function uses your gps location and allows you to point your mobile device at any structure to learn more about it.  The “Take Me There” function allows you to choose any building at the site and receive guided navigation to its location.\n\nThe descriptions for each building are available as text and audio files voiced by Dr. Barnhart.  Photos of each structure are included, as well as drawings and photos of the features inside the temples – ones you can’t see because they are barred from tourist access.  With the Tulum app, you can see the incredible murals that other visitors can’t!  \n\nThe Tulum app also includes:\n•General history of Tulum\n•Ed’s Tour – a recommended walking route\n•A complete buildings and features list\n•Personalizable photo and video galleries to remember your visit\n•Bibliographical references\n\nWhether you are planning on visiting Tulum or just want to learn more about the site, the Tulum app is an invaluable tool for anyone who wants to learn more about the ancient city.  No other source of Tulum information, book or otherwise, is more complete.  And thanks to wifi connections at selected restaurants in Tulum visitor’s center, you can download it data charge free right at the entrance to the ruins!"

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button. You can swipe through all your favorites on the main calculation interface just as you swipe the pages on the iPhone’s home screen.\n\n== Charts and Historic Rates==\neCurrency provides detailed historical charts for all exchange rates. Just rotate the device to landscape, to view the chart for the active currency pair. You can switch the chart display between a 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year or 5-year period. Tap on the chart to display the exact exchange rate tor a particular day. Tap and hold to use a specific exchange rate for historic calculations.\n\n== Exchange Rate Updates ==\neCurrency updates exchange rates automatically on every start-up or on demand. You can turn off automatic updates to avoid roaming costs. The conversion and calculation functionally works completely offline using the latest downloaded exchange rates; the display of historical charts requires an active internet connection.\n\n==Rates Provider==\neCurrency is not dependant on any single data-source. The application obtains its exchange rates from our self-developed Currency-Provider-engine that aggregates rates data from multiple sources to secure the reliability of exchange rate updates.\n\n== Tutorial & Support==\nOn the first startup a short self-running demo is displayed to introduce you to the app. We appreciate any reviews or comments you may have on eCurrency in iTunes. If you have any questions please contact us directly, as we are unable to respond to your enquiries via iTunes."

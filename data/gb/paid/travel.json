      "label": "The all NEW Enviroute comes with improved features which will let you know if either the M48 Severn bridge or the M4 Prince Of Wales bridge is closed or open in either direction.\nThis new version comes with improved push notifications, a more effective API (backed up with physical and LIVE monitoring of the bridges in person!), additional info on lane closures, and traffic in either direction.\nHere is some info on the Severn Crossings and just why this app is NEEDED for the people of Chepstow! \nEnviroute (Original) has been running for nearly 18 months now completely free of charge, and has over 200 5-Star ratings and reviews.  This NEW improved, paid version will help create more technology projects for the people of Chepstow and the surrounding areas.\nMore features are on their way for Enviroute, and we'll be adding surrounding roads / routes such as the M49 along with routes into Bristol, the M5, and more.\nIf you don't know about the original problems commuters have experienced with the Severn crossings, read on for some background...\nThe Severn bridges based between England and wales are major connections for the M4 and M48 motorways. Traditionally both crossings / bridges have been owned and operated by private companies.\n\n“Is the bridge open” and Enviroute have created an app that allows local residents and commuters to check the status of both bridges in order to plan their routes more effectively. From time to time the bridges are closed due to maintenance and/or adverse weather conditions and, since the ownership of the Severn bridges has changed there has been a lack of reliable communications around the status of the M48 Severn bridge and the M4 Severn Bridge.\n\n“Is the bridge open” is here to help with this and to provide information on when either of the Severn Bridges are closed or partially closed.\nSevern bridge updates at the touch of a button instead of endless maps, websites or twitter accounts. \nFind out instantly is the Severn Bridge is open and get updates sent directly to your device (Enviroute NEW now has this feature!) before you set off on your journey.\nBy paying for Enviroute NEW you are indirectly funding this local area for more exciting tech based projects.  We want to make life easier for residents of the surrounding areas, help local businesses sell more, save your local high-streets plus many more projects in the pipeline.  These will be funded by the money earned by Enviroute NEW\nThank you and I hope you enjoy the new version."

Don’t just come for the day, come for the stay and explore more of this spectacular area and its scenery.  \n\n\r\nThis GPS enabled app provides reassurance as you follow the arrow along your chosen route. It will also show you how far you are around the route. \n\n\r\nThis app has been developed alongside our National Park Yorkshire Three Peaks Rangers who have added points of interest along the routes for you. \n\n\r\nThe app also includes important safety advice and the code of conduct, which will help  you stay safe on the walks and help protect our  local communities. \n\n\r\nThe app is not a mapping tool. You must take other forms of navigation with you and know how to use them. We recommend you have an OS Explorer OL2 Yorkshire Dales (Southern and Western) map with you. \n\n\r\nUsing GPS tracking uses more of your battery than normal – do not rely solely on this app when walking.  \n\n\r\nAlways be prepared, conditions can change rapidly in an upland area such as the Three Peaks. \n\n\r\nYou must read the safety information contained in this app before using the route information.  \n  \r\nThe Yorkshire Three Peaks are very fragile environments, and the public rights of way network is under pressure from the hundreds of thousands of visitors that come to enjoy it each year. Maintaining the paths in the Yorkshire Three Peaks area costs on average £35 per metre. \n\n\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this app all go towards helping the Yorkshire Dales National Park with this work. \n\n\r\n\r\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\r\n\r\nContains OpenStreetMap Data © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\r\nhttps://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright \n\n\r\n\r\nThis walking app was developed for the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority by the team at Local Walks - www.localwalks.co.uk \n\n\r\n\r\nApp terms and conditions:\r\nhttps://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/apptermsandconditions"

      "label": "TrekRight: West Highland Way is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking all or part of the West Highland Way or exploring the beautiful region around the trail. \n\nTrekRight includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, B&Bs / hotels, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed offline maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\n# The Right Information, When You Need it\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching Drymen, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what points of interest are available around you, where you can find a pub, options for where to stay the night, easy access to interactive elevation profile charts, and clear, detailed directions. You can easily see what things you flagged as interesting, which things you added notes to, and which you marked as favourites. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n# Trekopedia\nTrekRight’s ‘West Highland Way Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information, organized into Communities, Accommodation, Attractions, Services, Points of Interest, and Route Sections. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n# Interactive Map / Offline Maps\nPowerful, flexible map built on top of our high-quality mapping engine, with full support for detailed offline map imagery. Displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Scroll, zoom, and rotate the map and (in online maps) configure to show street maps, satellite view, terrain, or a hybrid. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the West Highland Way.\n\n# Intelligent Compass\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Two special compass indicators are available – one points towards the end point of your current section (typically the next town on the route), and the other points which way you should go now, taking into consideration all the twists and turns in your route. Never get lost again!\n\n# Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank hotels / B&Bs, flag locations of interest as ‘favourites’, add your own notes, and more. Be prepared!\n\n# Up-To-Date Content\nTrekRight’s content is regularly being updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps (once downloaded). No Internet connection is required unless you want to use the online maps."

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button. You can swipe through all your favorites on the main calculation interface just as you swipe the pages on the iPhone’s home screen.\n\n== Charts and Historic Rates==\neCurrency provides detailed historical charts for all exchange rates.

The application obtains its exchange rates from our self-developed Currency-Provider-engine that aggregates rates data from multiple sources to secure the reliability of exchange rate updates.\n\n== Tutorial & Support==\nOn the first startup a short self-running demo is displayed to introduce you to the app. We appreciate any reviews or comments you may have on eCurrency in iTunes. If you have any questions please contact us directly, as we are unable to respond to your enquiries via iTunes."

      "label": "TrekRight: Cotswold Way is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking all or part of England's Cotswold Way long-distance trail or exploring the beautiful region surrounding it.\n\nIt includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, B&Bs / hotels, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed offline maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\n# The Right Information, When You Need it\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching a community, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what points of interest are available around you, where you can find a pub, and so on. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n# Trekopedia\nTrekRight’s ‘Cotswold Way Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n# Interactive Map / Offline Maps\nPowerful, flexible maps built on top of our high-quality mapping engine, with full support for detailed offline map imagery. Displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the trail.\n\n# Intelligent Compass\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Two special compass indicators are available – one points towards the end point of your current section (typically the next town on the route), and the other points which way you should go now, taking into consideration all the twists and turns in your route. Never get lost again!\n\n# Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank hotels / B&Bs, flag locations of interest as ‘favourites’, add your own notes, and more. Be prepared!\n\n# Up-To-Date Content\nTrekRight’s content is regularly being updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- Spotlight Integration ---\nTrekRight's content is fully indexed by iOS's amazing Spotlight search feature. Without even needing to open TrekRight, just call up Spotlight (swipe downwards from near the top of your phone's Home screen), enter what you are interested in, and if Spotlight finds it in TrekRight you simply press on a link to open that item. This works even if TrekRight isn't running and it works entirely offline! (iPhone 5 or later and iOS 9 or later needed for this feature).\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps (once downloaded). No Internet connection is required unless you want to use the online maps."

      "label": "Nolli for iPhone and iPad brings one of the greatest maps of all time to your smartphone: the great plan of Rome by Giambattista Nolli, originally published in 1748. An app to discover the city from the inside and to surprise you. An app to both lose and find yourself in Rome.\n\nNavigate the Rome of today with this eternal map, that is surprisingly still very valid for the historical center. See more than others, enjoying the fine detail and clear handcrafted graphics of this masterpiece of mapping.\n\nGo into the right direction with this app and you will discover a lot of interesting things that might not have caught your attention using a different map.\n\nThe app allows for using the map in high resolution, also offline without internet connection, in free browsing mode and in follow-me mode. All points of interest from the 2 original indices (alphabetical by category and spatial by number) have been georeferenced and are contained in the app (more than 1400) with their corresponding data (name, typological class, Rione, etc). With the search you can find all features from the indices and all text labels on the plan (more than 600).\n\nIn designing the present edition of the \"Nuova Topografia di Roma\" (New Topography of Rome, 12 sheets at a scale of 1:2900) and indices of the \"Nuova Pianta di Roma\" (New Map of Rome, index to the plan and diminished maps) we have spent great care with the aim to be as close to the original as possible regarding the labeling and the structure of the directories.\n\nTherefore the app reproduces in the indices on the left side of the map exactly those types in the exact order and (to the contemporary reader occasionally appearing outmoded) notation as provided by Giambattista Nolli in his indices. By selecting an entry you will be led to the corresponding location on the map. You can also browse by tapping on one of the numbers on the map to see what it is about.\n\nThe explanations of the signatures and line styles, hatches and selected abbreviations are reproduced in their original form (see \"Legend\"). You can access Nolli's original spelling of the indices, legend, and other signs at the bottom of the English version in Italian language.\n\nThe map itself has been georeferenced and in its projection adapted to that of popular web maps to make it usable with your mobile device, thereby enabling the exciting comparison of today's Rome with that of Nolli's times (mid-18th century).\n\nWe hope you enjoy the electronic edition of this milestone in the history of cartography!"

      "label": "This App is based on content licensed from Mayo Clinic and helps travelers safeguard their health before, during and after travel. This App is developed by experienced travel medicine consultants from Mayo Clinic focusing on your health during travel and provides tips for preventing and handling illnesses while traveling. Providers refer their patients to this App so that travelers have the information when they need.\n\nThe App is easy to use:\n\n1. Find your destination by browsing or searching from the home screen.\n2. When you find your destination country, press “Add This to My Trips” \n3. Get a list of recommended vaccines by pressing “Health and Vaccinations”. (If you have not received the recommended vaccines for this trip, contact your healthcare provider). This section also tells you if you need to take medicine for malaria prevention (an infection transmitted by mosquitoes that attacks and breaks down red blood cells in your body).\n4. “Packing List” recommends things you should carry with you for that trip (touching the radial buttons marks those items complete). You can modify this list and add new items.\n5. “To Do” section reminds you of important travel and health related preparations you need to make before your trip. Add or delete items based on your needs.\n6. Save your travel documents and health related information in “My Stuff” section.\n\nDetails of App features:\n\nCustomized recommendations for travel health based on your travel itinerary.  Recommendations on safe travel for sick travelers.\n\nLicensed Mayo Clinic's content for \"Health\" section provides information on symptoms and prevention strategies for a broad range of travel related illnesses including Jet Lag and Sleep, Motion and Altitude Sickness, Travel Diarrhea, insect transmitted illnesses and many more. \n\nLatest safety alerts are a touch away. Navigate to Travel Alerts and Warnings issued by US Department of State (links provided in the app). While in this section, enroll in Smart Travel Enrollment Program (STEP), a free service to allow U.S. citizens/Nationals traveling abroad to enroll with the local U.S. Embassy.\n\nThe app provides simple exercises that can be performed with limited leg space on board aircraft. How? Well, we've got pictures to show you how. Stay fit while on board aircraft and prevent the dreaded blood clots in the legs.\n\nWhat if you lose your passport while traveling? We've got you covered. Store all your travel documents in \"My Stuff\" section. \n\nThe app lets you store Immunization records, your doctor’s contact information, list of allergies, medication information (pictures of pills, dosages, frequency) and your health insurance information.  This information can be life saving in case you lose your luggage and medications kept in it (Trust us, it happens more frequently than you think).\n\nStore unlimited customized items with pictures in the “My Stuff” Custom Item section of the App.  It is up to your imagination as you can use the packing list as your shopping list.  All information is stored on your device, making it available when needed and eliminating cloud-based document storage risk.\n\nUpon return, archive the trip and you can use your customized lists for your next destination (a great feature for frequent fliers).\n  \nFriendly reminder: Keep in mind that this app is not a replacement for consultation with a Travel Medicine Doctor or your primary healthcare provider. Your medical condition may warrant precautions that your Doctor may tell you.  So pay a visit before travel.\n\nThis is the only App that has information on Hajj and Umrah."

Once you have identified the animal you have spotted, press a button to list it with date and time of observation, a feature that will help you later when you come to sort your photos once home.\n\nThe search menu also provides the exact name in English along with the family name; although by \"family name\", we don't mean \"family\" in the scientific sense, but rather information about the class (sub­ family, genus or species) to which the animal belongs. You can visually search using the icon on the screen as well as using the keyboard.\n\n\nMammals\n\nThe app lists mammals you might see during the day on safari. The app also lists two nocturnal mammals, as you might occasionally spot them on night safaris: genets and galagos, also known as \"bush-babies\".\n\nThe following search filters are available to you:\n\n• Size\n• Plantigrade or ungulate\n\n\nBirds\n\nMany more than 2'000 different species of bird live south of the Sahara. Some remain in their habitats, while others are migratory birds that over­winter in Africa during the European winter. \nSometimes the differences in appearance and body shape are minimal, for instance as is the case with the sand grouse, woodpecker, ibis etc. However, thanks to the family name in the search menu, you'll at least be able to identify to which order the bird belongs.\n\nThe following search filters are available to you:\n\n• Colour of plumage\n• Size, divided into  30, 30­/70, 70 cm, in feet/inches: 11'', 11''/2'3'', 2'3''.\n• Beak length in relation to body length: short/medium/long\n• Observing location: in and  on water, on the ground or above ground (e.g. tree, shrub etc.)\n\nAnd now get going and experience the magnificence of the African countryside."

      "label": "FLORENCE, the latest app in the Art & Culture series, is a cultural travel guide with a difference, an app that offers comprehensive, expert coverage of all the sights and attractions in the great city that gave birth to the Renaissance, an essential companion for anyone who wants to understand how Florence became Florence. How did Brunelleschi build the city’s landmark dome, and teach the city’s artists about perspective? Which great Florentine architect invented gelato? Who was the model for Botticelli’s Venus?\n\nWhether you only have a couple of days to visit Florence’s museums, or want to spend a vacation seeking out every single work by Donatello or every Medici villa, this is the app for you. The 400 entries cover not only the tourist sights, but also the biographies of the artists, sculptors, architects and writers who changed the history of the western art and thought from Masaccio and Michelangelo to the most obscure. \n\nAlong with a lively account of Florence’s fascinating, turbulent history, Florence Art & Culture includes quirky anecdotes and special insights into everything from the importance of guilds in the Middle Ages and the rules of Calcio Storico, the Renaissance version of football still played today, to the city’s passion for a juicy tripe sandwich.  It covers the hills of Florence and goes beyond into the nearby beautiful landscapes of Chianti and the Mugello, the homeland of the Medici.  \n\nDana Facaros and Michael Pauls, authors of the best-selling Cadogan Guides to Tuscany and Italy have been exploring and enjoying Florence since 1981. This new app carries on the inspiration behind their Art & Culture series: bringing the old ideal of an informed, serious guidebook into the digital world. You won’t find listings of hotels, restaurants and shopping—those are available in a thousand places at the click of a button.\n\nInstead, this app gives you what no one else can. No other guide comes close in its coverage of Florence’s history, architecture, art, festivals, personalities and oddities.  Maps and up-to-date practical information on opening hours and tickets, plus the app’s easy to use search facility and favourites button make planning your trip to Florence a cinch."

Containing all the content from the the best-selling travel book \"Wild Swimming\" by Daniel Start (Wild Things Publishing £16.99, second edition, 2013) this app provides all you need to visit hundreds of magical rivers, lakes and waterfalls across the UK. \n\nIn this great British tour you’ll be able to swim with otters in Devon, go river-tubing in Yorkshire, night-swim under the stars in Oxfordshire and learn how to build a woodland sauna. In each area you can ready background chapters on famous wild-swimmers of the past and read stories of heroes, lovers and ordinary folk who have long enjoyed bathing under the willows. Perfect whether you are a wild swimmer, family paddler or just enjoy a waterside picnic.\n\nNOTE: due to the large number of images and places the app is slow to load first time and may not work well (or crash) if many other apps are open in parallel. Please close other apps.\n\nYou will find preloaded maps, photos, directions and travel writing to inspire and inform. Most locations comes with stunning photography and some include detailed mapping (at 1:25,000 to help walkers and 1:250,000 to help with route-planning). There is contact information for nearby pubs, campsites and attractions. If you need inspiration you can browse the app by slideshow, list, photo gallery and on an interactive map. Ask the app to find places close to you, or search using postcode, address, star rating, walk-in time, keywords or other features. You can share places on email and Facebook and save favourites too."

No hidden costs.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Vía de la Plata from Sevilla to Santiago de Compostela and includes the connection to the Camino Francés in Astorga. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 300 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical map will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

All of the UK is covered, from Exeter to Perth and Swansea to Canterbury. \n\nThe app also features optional persistent location tracking, allowing the user to receive a notification when approaching a listed motorway walk even when the app is in the background. Please note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life, and that this feature is best activated when already on a listed motorway to conserve battery.\n\nUse this app to get more fun for your fuel, see more of the countryside, take a healthy break, or enjoy a relaxing pub lunch. \n\nThe app features nearly 200 30- to 45-minute walks, many with a selected pub or café along the way. Activities for children are included, from play areas and bouncy castles to nature trails. \n\nAll of the walks are suitable for dogs, and those with assistance dogs will find details of accessible paths and disabled facilities – for example, RADAR, a key that is made available to registered disabled people, which enables them to access locked disabled WCs and facilities. \n\nMost of the pubs are traditional inns, serving high quality food at realistic prices. Landlords, chefs and opening times can change quickly, and phone numbers are given for you to check in advance to avoid disappointment. \n\nThe listed pubs all welcome well-behaved canines. \n\nSimple to use – just select the motorway, then browse the junctions and select the walk you want. The app includes a handy map view, making it easier to find your way."

      "label": "Love exploring Death Valley but hate that you can't get a cell signal in the park, making it nearly impossible to find the best sights? Well, today's your lucky day!\n\nIntroducing our new offline Death Valley National Park (and surrounding areas) photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection, simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest Death Valley spots including Zabriskie Point, Darwin Falls, Natural Bridge Death Valley, Artist’s Palette, and Badwater Basin - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like Teakettle Junction, Mosaic Canyon, Keane Wonder Mine, Sidewinder Canyon, Aguereberry Point, and the Leadfield Ghost Town, plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our Death Valley photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal (and that's basically the entire park).\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

It includes over 700 species profiles detailing physical characteristics, behaviours and locations, and each is accompanied by breathtaking photography to aid identification. The 700+ species profiles cover:\n- All 148 mammal species ever recorded in Kruger, including the best places to find them.\n- Over 60 footprint graphics so you can identify wildlife spoor.\n- 500+ bird species, including all of Kruger’s resident, migrant visitor and vagrant records since 2010. Stunning bird photography includes male, female, juvenile and breeding plumage where relevant.\n- Over 500 bird audio files bring the sounds of the bush to life.\n- 60+ profiles of commonly encountered reptiles and invertebrates, including crocodiles, snakes, lizards, tortoises, butterflies, spiders & much more.\n\nThe Guided Routes use our experience from many years exploring Kruger to create 70+ incredible journeys through the park:\n- The routes are like having an in-person guide in your pocket. Each includes extensive commentary that doesn’t just say, “Take that road because it’s good for lions,” but instead explains the geology of each area, which in turn informs the flora that grows there, the herbivores that eat that flora and, ultimately, the predators that hunt those herbivores.\n- Each route will help you develop an intimate insight into Kruger’s incredible wilderness.\n- Each of the rest camps and entrance gates is covered with short, medium and full-day routes to explore.\n\nThe Maps are the most detailed and up-to-date available:\n- They include newly opened roads and correct errors found in the maps available in the park shops. \n- For first-time visitors to Kruger, note that you are not provided with a map and must buy one from a park shop at a cost similar to this App.\n- The live GPS map means you'll never get lost.\n\nWith over half a million words of content, KrugerExplorer is the most comprehensive and unparalleled encyclopedia for the Greater Kruger ever created.\n\nSince launching in 2019, the App has had a superb reception from fans and received wonderful accolades:\n- Downloads in over 80 countries\n- App Store “App of the Day”\n- “Recommended” commendation by BirdLife South Africa\n- “Highly Recommended” by Getaway Magazine\n\nKrugerExplorer is also a global community of wildlife lovers. You can enjoy the stories, photos and experiences of our 200,000+ followers on Facebook & Instagram. We look forward to seeing you there!\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n- Yes, the App works 100% offline once fully downloaded. You can put your device into flight mode, escape to the bush and still make full use of the App!\n- Yes, this App is a one-time purchase, with no further in-app purchases or ongoing subscriptions required.\n- This is an English language app.\n\nHappy exploring,\nDanny & Charlotte"

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

The app covers 220 locations with 900 photographs. \n\nScotland is one of the most romantic of countries with its misty heather glens, miles of white beaches, crystal blue waters and lochs that look like mirrors, set against a background of stunning snow capped mountains. However, there is another, darker side to Scotland, with its blood soaked and turbulent history, that pitted clan against clan, that saw Scotland ripped apart in a brutal civil war, with risings and rebellions that ended with the defeat of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746 at the Battle of Culloden. Scotland is crammed full of history with castles steeped in tales of ghosts, torture, dungeons, of sieges, and of betrayal.  \n\nFrom the mystical Isle of Skye to the Lowlands, this app will help guide you to some of the amazing sites of interest - from Scotland's most haunted castle, to the battlefields of Culloden, Prestonpans, Falkirk and Bannockburn. To see the oldest stone memorial to Sir William Wallace and the prison where a 5 year old French drummer boy was held.

It is a great way to learn about all the history of Scotland, and can be used whether or not you are actually on site.

If you ever wonder where you are, your altitude, ground speed, direct distance to your destination in Miles, Nautical Miles and Kilometers, and how many hours you still have to get there, this app will help you!  \n\n Flight Nav uses GPS signals while in Airplane Mode to display your position, estimated distance, and time to your destination.\n\nYou can record your flight and later share it as a GPX file. This option will consume more battery as it will operate even while you are not using your device.\n\nOther features include a \"Don't sleep\" feature to keep the screen on.\n\n  GPS reception from within an aircraft can sometimes be poor. Best results are with window seats, or close to them, and you might have to wait longer to get results than you would while on the ground. What this means is that you might not get any signal at all, and the app might not work as expected every time, especially if you're sitting in the middle seats of a wide body airplane.\n\nMap detail will not be available at every zoom level - since you will be running offline - and you should use the app before flying, while still connected, in order to cache map information.\n\n  You should only use your device when allowed by the cabin crew - Please, pay attention to the specific instructions regarding mobile devices. If you have doubts about using your device, even with Airplane Mode enabled, please consult the cabin crew.  \n\nYou can add your own destinations by long pressing the map on the location you want.\n\nContinued use of GPS can dramatically decrease battery life."

How many times did you get to your bus stop just to wave your bus goodbye as it passes you because you were a moment too late? We would all like to just hop onto a bus without waiting ages at a stop. Now we can.\n\nKey features:\n- Search by name: You can add bus stops by searching for them by name\n- Search by ID: You can also add bus stops by entering bus stop ID, each bus stop has its ID printed on a code plate placed above the timetable\n- Search by location: You can quickly add bus stops that are located near you at any time\n- Current location arrivals: You can check bus arrivals at the bus stop that's the closest to you at any time without knowing it's name\n\nDo you have any suggestions for improvements? We're interested in your comments (craftycrew.team@gmail.com)."

      "label": "Ever been stood at a Bus Stop wondering when the next bus is? Or sat at home / in the pub wondering if you need to set off yet? There are a couple of way to do this if you are in Yorkshire, but none are specifically aimed at the iPhone.\n\n1.Text the 8 digit bus stop number to 63876 (A text message is charged at your standard outbound rate plus a maximum of 12p for the returned text.) \n\n2.Use the \"YourNextBus Service\" at  http://www.wymetro.com/yournextbus/search/ in Mobile Safari (What a hassle to navigate and remember all your stop numbers)\n\nNow you can have a dedicated app which will store your favourite Bus Stop numbers and present the results in an iPhone / iPad friendly format. With lots of useful features some of which are not available on the web …\n\n• Where available get the REAL arrival time of the busses, not timetabled times, but the actual time the bus is due at your chosen stop via the GPS tracker on the bus.\n• Check future arrival times by using the +1hr/-1hr buttons to move an hour or more along the schedules. \n• Store a list of \"Favourite Stops\" and organise them in Alphabetical order or simply order / rename them as you like.\n• Busses with a Live Feed will have their times highlighted in green and show how many minutes until they are due.\n• Busses with a Low Floor access for pushchairs and prams are indicated by a blue wheelchair icon on the end of the result.\n• You can tap on results to be alerted at your specified number of minutes before the bus is due, so you know when to set off.\n• Set an Auto-Refresh time to regularly reload the timetable data (Double Tap at the top of the timetable to enable).\n• The app will offer to fall back to SMS if you don't have a Data Connection on your phone.\n• Optional Shake to refresh and pull down on the results to refresh times.\n• Search for Busses / Stops by Postcode, Bus Number, or search for other bus stops near your current stop.\n• Use your phone's GPS to show a map of all the bus stops around you. \n• Our app uses the \"text-only\" version of the YourNextBus page and doesn't download images etc, this makes its very quick and saves on your data usage.\n• Large Text view for Sight Impaired users of iPads (enabled in the settings).\n\nIMPORTANT - Before purchasing we suggest you use the West Yorkshire Public Transport site linked above to make sure you can see information on the busses and stops you require. We can only provide the same information, so if you cannot find relevant information on their websites, our app will not be able to magically provide it. \n\nWe have thoroughly tested in Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield, Harrogate, Doncaster, Scarborough and York but please ensure your area is covered before purchase.\n\nPlease don't shoot the messenger by leaving negative reviews regarding the actual Bus Times data we display, this is from the WYPTE website and we can only show the data they offer. If the times are wrong, or the bus doesn’t turn up, then the problem is with their data or services and not our wonderful app! :)\n\n\nIf you have any suggestions or in the unlikely event of a problem please contact us via the Icons on the Service Status tab (Email, Twitter, Facebook, WWW). We cannot reply to comments left in the ratings on here, but we can assure you that you will receive a swift personal reply to any comments you send us via the Application.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimetable information provided by West Yorkshire Public Transport Executive (WYPTE).\nNote: Neither this application or its author is associated with or endorsed by WYPTE."

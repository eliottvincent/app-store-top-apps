This NEW improved, paid version will help create more technology projects for the people of Chepstow and the surrounding areas.\nMore features are on their way for Enviroute, and we'll be adding surrounding roads / routes such as the M49 along with routes into Bristol, the M5, and more.\nIf you don't know about the original problems commuters have experienced with the Severn crossings, read on for some background...\nThe Severn bridges based between England and wales are major connections for the M4 and M48 motorways. Traditionally both crossings / bridges have been owned and operated by private companies.\n\n“Is the bridge open” and Enviroute have created an app that allows local residents and commuters to check the status of both bridges in order to plan their routes more effectively. From time to time the bridges are closed due to maintenance and/or adverse weather conditions and, since the ownership of the Severn bridges has changed there has been a lack of reliable communications around the status of the M48 Severn bridge and the M4 Severn Bridge.\n\n“Is the bridge open” is here to help with this and to provide information on when either of the Severn Bridges are closed or partially closed.\nSevern bridge updates at the touch of a button instead of endless maps, websites or twitter accounts. \nFind out instantly is the Severn Bridge is open and get updates sent directly to your device (Enviroute NEW now has this feature!) before you set off on your journey.\nBy paying for Enviroute NEW you are indirectly funding this local area for more exciting tech based projects.  We want to make life easier for residents of the surrounding areas, help local businesses sell more, save your local high-streets plus many more projects in the pipeline.  These will be funded by the money earned by Enviroute NEW\nThank you and I hope you enjoy the new version."

Every year thousands come to reach the top of at least one or to conquer all three in one go. \n\n\r\nThe app contains route details for the classic 24-mile circular walk, route maps for the individual peaks, Whernside, Pen-y-ghent and Ingleborough and four other shorter walks in the Three Peaks area. Don’t just come for the day, come for the stay and explore more of this spectacular area and its scenery.  \n\n\r\nThis GPS enabled app provides reassurance as you follow the arrow along your chosen route. It will also show you how far you are around the route. \n\n\r\nThis app has been developed alongside our National Park Yorkshire Three Peaks Rangers who have added points of interest along the routes for you. \n\n\r\nThe app also includes important safety advice and the code of conduct, which will help  you stay safe on the walks and help protect our  local communities. \n\n\r\nThe app is not a mapping tool. You must take other forms of navigation with you and know how to use them. We recommend you have an OS Explorer OL2 Yorkshire Dales (Southern and Western) map with you. \n\n\r\nUsing GPS tracking uses more of your battery than normal – do not rely solely on this app when walking.  \n\n\r\nAlways be prepared, conditions can change rapidly in an upland area such as the Three Peaks. \n\n\r\nYou must read the safety information contained in this app before using the route information.  \n  \r\nThe Yorkshire Three Peaks are very fragile environments, and the public rights of way network is under pressure from the hundreds of thousands of visitors that come to enjoy it each year. Maintaining the paths in the Yorkshire Three Peaks area costs on average £35 per metre. \n\n\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this app all go towards helping the Yorkshire Dales National Park with this work. \n\n\r\n\r\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\r\n\r\nContains OpenStreetMap Data © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\r\nhttps://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright \n\n\r\n\r\nThis walking app was developed for the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority by the team at Local Walks - www.localwalks.co.uk \n\n\r\n\r\nApp terms and conditions:\r\nhttps://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/apptermsandconditions"

You’ve satisfied my nerdy needs and I am so impressed as to how slick it is. Well done”\n\n\"love the AR mode\"\n\nSafety Information\n\nNot for use in safety critical applications, level crossings, etc. Train position is estimated from latest available timing point data and may be incorrect.

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "TrekRight: Camino Portugués is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking all or part of the Portugués route of the Camino de Santiago.\n\nTrekRight includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, albergues / hotels, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed offline maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\nThis app includes:\n- Detailed coverage of the Portugués from Porto northward, including the Central route plus growing coverage of the Coastal and Senda Litoral routes. \n- In-depth coverage is available for the popular Variante Espiritual option as well as some other alternatives. \n- Limited coverage is available for the Lisbon to Porto route, currently including the route itself, most albergues, and geo-located communities. \n- Offline maps (including with this purchase) for Porto to Santiago, including Central, Coastal, and Senda Litoral variants.\n- Offline maps are also available via in-app purchase for Lisbon to Porto. \n\nLet us know if you are interested in other Portugués variants and we'll try to add them as well.  \n\n# The Right Information, When You Need it\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching a community, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what points of interest are available around you, where you can find a restaurant, and so on. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n# Trekopedia\nTrekRight’s ‘Camino Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n# Interactive Map / Offline Maps\nPowerful, flexible maps built on top of our high-quality mapping engine, with full support for detailed offline map imagery. Displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the trail.\n\n# Intelligent Compass\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Never get lost again!\n\n# Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank albergues / hotels, flag locations of interest as ‘favourites’, add your own notes, and more. Be prepared!\n\n# Up-To-Date Content\nTrekRight’s content is regularly being updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps. Once the offline maps are downloaded, no Internet connection is required."

Containing all the content from the the best-selling travel book \"Wild Swimming\" by Daniel Start (Wild Things Publishing £16.99, second edition, 2013) this app provides all you need to visit hundreds of magical rivers, lakes and waterfalls across the UK. \n\nIn this great British tour you’ll be able to swim with otters in Devon, go river-tubing in Yorkshire, night-swim under the stars in Oxfordshire and learn how to build a woodland sauna. In each area you can ready background chapters on famous wild-swimmers of the past and read stories of heroes, lovers and ordinary folk who have long enjoyed bathing under the willows. Perfect whether you are a wild swimmer, family paddler or just enjoy a waterside picnic.\n\nNOTE: due to the large number of images and places the app is slow to load first time and may not work well (or crash) if many other apps are open in parallel. Please close other apps.\n\nYou will find preloaded maps, photos, directions and travel writing to inspire and inform. Most locations comes with stunning photography and some include detailed mapping (at 1:25,000 to help walkers and 1:250,000 to help with route-planning). There is contact information for nearby pubs, campsites and attractions. If you need inspiration you can browse the app by slideshow, list, photo gallery and on an interactive map. Ask the app to find places close to you, or search using postcode, address, star rating, walk-in time, keywords or other features. You can share places on email and Facebook and save favourites too."

      "label": "Travel the world with confidence and enjoy local dishes without compromising your vegan beliefs! With your trusty Vegan Passport, you can be sure of finding vegan food in restaurants around the globe.\n\nThis multilingual vegan guide is a must-have for globetrotting vegans. It’s small enough to slip into your pocket, but big enough to include the languages of over 96% of the world’s population.\n\nThe fifth edition of this essential guide has been updated and expanded, and now boasts 78 languages including Hausa, Igbo, Xhosa and Zulu.\n\nIncluding fail-safe pictures, which can be used when words don’t work, the Vegan Passport has all situations covered. This will ensure that you have no problem explaining what you do and don’t eat, no matter where you are in the world.\n\nWhen visiting a restaurant, show your waiter the relevant entry from this app, and ask them to read it.  Do not attempt to pronounce the text yourself!  If you are invited to a private home for a meal, show your host the relevant entry well in advance.  \n\nIf booking a hotel by post or email, send a copy of the relevant page.  Please note that several languages may be used in the place you are visiting, so you may be able to offer the reader a choice of languages.  \n\nIf all else fails then you can show them the images depicting what a vegan eats and what a vegan does not eat.\n\nWhen booking flights then you can refer to the below airplane meal code to request a vegan meal when booking.\n\nThe Vegan Society is a registered charity and the oldest vegan society in the world, founded on 1 November 1944, in the UK by Donald Watson.\n\nWhat do we want? Simple: a world where humans do not exploit non-human animals. A world where animals are free to exist in their own right. We promote a lifestyle that excludes, as far as possible and practical, all forms of exploitation of - and cruelty to - animals for the purposes of food, clothing or anything else.\n\nWe also want a just world for humans. A world where resources are utilised in a sustainable way to ensure all current and future generations are provided for - a world where no one goes hungry. At the heart of the sustainability and food justice agenda is plant-based food production and consumption: veganism."

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "Teleport™ is a first-person drone flight experience powered by intuitive body movement. Leverage your innate sense of space, lean in the direction you want to fly, and minimize motion sickness.\n\nTeleportation requires a DJI drone controllable via iOS (such as a DJI Spark via WiFi or DJI Phantom 4 via USB) and an optional wearable stereoscopic 3D headset (like Google Cardboard).  Connect your iPhone or iPad to the drone and run the Teleport app.  Launch your drone into the air, then tap \"Teleport\" and mount iPhone in your headset.  Knock on the headset to cycle between (1) safety mode, (2) elevation mode and (3) travel mode.\n\nIn safety mode, drone holds a stationary position in the sky, allowing you to look around from the vantage point of the drone.  In elevation mode, pivot your head up/down to adjust the drone's elevation.  In travel mode, lean forward to fly forward; lean back to fly backwards; lean left to fly left; and lean right to fly right.  The further you lean, the faster you go.  When done flying, knock on headset until in safety mode, remove headset and exit to main app screen.  From there, you can manually land the drone using a physical controller or tap 'Return' to automatically return to home.  Have fun and teleport safely!\n\nCopyright © 2018 MONKEYmedia, Inc.

      "label": "TrekRight: West Highland Way is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking all or part of the West Highland Way or exploring the beautiful region around the trail. \n\nTrekRight includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, B&Bs / hotels, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed offline maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\n# The Right Information, When You Need it\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching Drymen, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what points of interest are available around you, where you can find a pub, options for where to stay the night, easy access to interactive elevation profile charts, and clear, detailed directions. You can easily see what things you flagged as interesting, which things you added notes to, and which you marked as favourites. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n# Trekopedia\nTrekRight’s ‘West Highland Way Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information, organized into Communities, Accommodation, Attractions, Services, Points of Interest, and Route Sections. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n# Interactive Map / Offline Maps\nPowerful, flexible map built on top of our high-quality mapping engine, with full support for detailed offline map imagery. Displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Scroll, zoom, and rotate the map and (in online maps) configure to show street maps, satellite view, terrain, or a hybrid. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the West Highland Way.\n\n# Intelligent Compass\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Two special compass indicators are available – one points towards the end point of your current section (typically the next town on the route), and the other points which way you should go now, taking into consideration all the twists and turns in your route. Never get lost again!\n\n# Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank hotels / B&Bs, flag locations of interest as ‘favourites’, add your own notes, and more. Be prepared!\n\n# Up-To-Date Content\nTrekRight’s content is regularly being updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps (once downloaded). No Internet connection is required unless you want to use the online maps."

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button.

      "label": "TrekRight: Cotswold Way is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking all or part of England's Cotswold Way long-distance trail or exploring the beautiful region surrounding it.\n\nIt includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, B&Bs / hotels, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed offline maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\n# The Right Information, When You Need it\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching a community, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what points of interest are available around you, where you can find a pub, and so on. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n# Trekopedia\nTrekRight’s ‘Cotswold Way Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n# Interactive Map / Offline Maps\nPowerful, flexible maps built on top of our high-quality mapping engine, with full support for detailed offline map imagery. Displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the trail.\n\n# Intelligent Compass\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Two special compass indicators are available – one points towards the end point of your current section (typically the next town on the route), and the other points which way you should go now, taking into consideration all the twists and turns in your route. Never get lost again!\n\n# Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank hotels / B&Bs, flag locations of interest as ‘favourites’, add your own notes, and more. Be prepared!\n\n# Up-To-Date Content\nTrekRight’s content is regularly being updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- Spotlight Integration ---\nTrekRight's content is fully indexed by iOS's amazing Spotlight search feature. Without even needing to open TrekRight, just call up Spotlight (swipe downwards from near the top of your phone's Home screen), enter what you are interested in, and if Spotlight finds it in TrekRight you simply press on a link to open that item. This works even if TrekRight isn't running and it works entirely offline! (iPhone 5 or later and iOS 9 or later needed for this feature).\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps (once downloaded). No Internet connection is required unless you want to use the online maps."

An app to discover the city from the inside and to surprise you. An app to both lose and find yourself in Rome.\n\nNavigate the Rome of today with this eternal map, that is surprisingly still very valid for the historical center. See more than others, enjoying the fine detail and clear handcrafted graphics of this masterpiece of mapping.\n\nGo into the right direction with this app and you will discover a lot of interesting things that might not have caught your attention using a different map.\n\nThe app allows for using the map in high resolution, also offline without internet connection, in free browsing mode and in follow-me mode. All points of interest from the 2 original indices (alphabetical by category and spatial by number) have been georeferenced and are contained in the app (more than 1400) with their corresponding data (name, typological class, Rione, etc). With the search you can find all features from the indices and all text labels on the plan (more than 600).\n\nIn designing the present edition of the \"Nuova Topografia di Roma\" (New Topography of Rome, 12 sheets at a scale of 1:2900) and indices of the \"Nuova Pianta di Roma\" (New Map of Rome, index to the plan and diminished maps) we have spent great care with the aim to be as close to the original as possible regarding the labeling and the structure of the directories.\n\nTherefore the app reproduces in the indices on the left side of the map exactly those types in the exact order and (to the contemporary reader occasionally appearing outmoded) notation as provided by Giambattista Nolli in his indices. By selecting an entry you will be led to the corresponding location on the map. You can also browse by tapping on one of the numbers on the map to see what it is about.\n\nThe explanations of the signatures and line styles, hatches and selected abbreviations are reproduced in their original form (see \"Legend\"). You can access Nolli's original spelling of the indices, legend, and other signs at the bottom of the English version in Italian language.\n\nThe map itself has been georeferenced and in its projection adapted to that of popular web maps to make it usable with your mobile device, thereby enabling the exciting comparison of today's Rome with that of Nolli's times (mid-18th century).\n\nWe hope you enjoy the electronic edition of this milestone in the history of cartography!"

This App is developed by experienced travel medicine consultants from Mayo Clinic focusing on your health during travel and provides tips for preventing and handling illnesses while traveling. Providers refer their patients to this App so that travelers have the information when they need.\n\nThe App is easy to use:\n\n1. Find your destination by browsing or searching from the home screen.\n2. When you find your destination country, press “Add This to My Trips” \n3. Get a list of recommended vaccines by pressing “Health and Vaccinations”. (If you have not received the recommended vaccines for this trip, contact your healthcare provider). This section also tells you if you need to take medicine for malaria prevention (an infection transmitted by mosquitoes that attacks and breaks down red blood cells in your body).\n4. “Packing List” recommends things you should carry with you for that trip (touching the radial buttons marks those items complete). You can modify this list and add new items.\n5. “To Do” section reminds you of important travel and health related preparations you need to make before your trip. Add or delete items based on your needs.\n6. Save your travel documents and health related information in “My Stuff” section.\n\nDetails of App features:\n\nCustomized recommendations for travel health based on your travel itinerary.  Recommendations on safe travel for sick travelers.\n\nLicensed Mayo Clinic's content for \"Health\" section provides information on symptoms and prevention strategies for a broad range of travel related illnesses including Jet Lag and Sleep, Motion and Altitude Sickness, Travel Diarrhea, insect transmitted illnesses and many more. \n\nLatest safety alerts are a touch away. Navigate to Travel Alerts and Warnings issued by US Department of State (links provided in the app). While in this section, enroll in Smart Travel Enrollment Program (STEP), a free service to allow U.S. citizens/Nationals traveling abroad to enroll with the local U.S. Embassy.\n\nThe app provides simple exercises that can be performed with limited leg space on board aircraft. How? Well, we've got pictures to show you how. Stay fit while on board aircraft and prevent the dreaded blood clots in the legs.\n\nWhat if you lose your passport while traveling? We've got you covered. Store all your travel documents in \"My Stuff\" section. \n\nThe app lets you store Immunization records, your doctor’s contact information, list of allergies, medication information (pictures of pills, dosages, frequency) and your health insurance information.  This information can be life saving in case you lose your luggage and medications kept in it (Trust us, it happens more frequently than you think).\n\nStore unlimited customized items with pictures in the “My Stuff” Custom Item section of the App.  It is up to your imagination as you can use the packing list as your shopping list.  All information is stored on your device, making it available when needed and eliminating cloud-based document storage risk.\n\nUpon return, archive the trip and you can use your customized lists for your next destination (a great feature for frequent fliers).\n  \nFriendly reminder: Keep in mind that this app is not a replacement for consultation with a Travel Medicine Doctor or your primary healthcare provider. Your medical condition may warrant precautions that your Doctor may tell you.  So pay a visit before travel.\n\nThis is the only App that has information on Hajj and Umrah."

Once you have identified the animal you have spotted, press a button to list it with date and time of observation, a feature that will help you later when you come to sort your photos once home.\n\nThe search menu also provides the exact name in English along with the family name; although by \"family name\", we don't mean \"family\" in the scientific sense, but rather information about the class (sub­ family, genus or species) to which the animal belongs. You can visually search using the icon on the screen as well as using the keyboard.\n\n\nMammals\n\nThe app lists mammals you might see during the day on safari. The app also lists two nocturnal mammals, as you might occasionally spot them on night safaris: genets and galagos, also known as \"bush-babies\".\n\nThe following search filters are available to you:\n\n• Size\n• Plantigrade or ungulate\n\n\nBirds\n\nMany more than 2'000 different species of bird live south of the Sahara. Some remain in their habitats, while others are migratory birds that over­winter in Africa during the European winter. \nSometimes the differences in appearance and body shape are minimal, for instance as is the case with the sand grouse, woodpecker, ibis etc. However, thanks to the family name in the search menu, you'll at least be able to identify to which order the bird belongs.\n\nThe following search filters are available to you:\n\n• Colour of plumage\n• Size, divided into  30, 30­/70, 70 cm, in feet/inches: 11'', 11''/2'3'', 2'3''.\n• Beak length in relation to body length: short/medium/long\n• Observing location: in and  on water, on the ground or above ground (e.g. tree, shrub etc.)\n\nAnd now get going and experience the magnificence of the African countryside."

      "label": "FLORENCE, the latest app in the Art & Culture series, is a cultural travel guide with a difference, an app that offers comprehensive, expert coverage of all the sights and attractions in the great city that gave birth to the Renaissance, an essential companion for anyone who wants to understand how Florence became Florence. How did Brunelleschi build the city’s landmark dome, and teach the city’s artists about perspective? Which great Florentine architect invented gelato? Who was the model for Botticelli’s Venus?\n\nWhether you only have a couple of days to visit Florence’s museums, or want to spend a vacation seeking out every single work by Donatello or every Medici villa, this is the app for you. The 400 entries cover not only the tourist sights, but also the biographies of the artists, sculptors, architects and writers who changed the history of the western art and thought from Masaccio and Michelangelo to the most obscure. \n\nAlong with a lively account of Florence’s fascinating, turbulent history, Florence Art & Culture includes quirky anecdotes and special insights into everything from the importance of guilds in the Middle Ages and the rules of Calcio Storico, the Renaissance version of football still played today, to the city’s passion for a juicy tripe sandwich.  It covers the hills of Florence and goes beyond into the nearby beautiful landscapes of Chianti and the Mugello, the homeland of the Medici.  \n\nDana Facaros and Michael Pauls, authors of the best-selling Cadogan Guides to Tuscany and Italy have been exploring and enjoying Florence since 1981. This new app carries on the inspiration behind their Art & Culture series: bringing the old ideal of an informed, serious guidebook into the digital world. You won’t find listings of hotels, restaurants and shopping—those are available in a thousand places at the click of a button.\n\nInstead, this app gives you what no one else can. No other guide comes close in its coverage of Florence’s history, architecture, art, festivals, personalities and oddities.  Maps and up-to-date practical information on opening hours and tickets, plus the app’s easy to use search facility and favourites button make planning your trip to Florence a cinch."

      "label": "Pasinaudoję šia programėle Jūs sužinosite daugybę naujų ir įkvepiančių istorijų apie Lietuvos Didžiąją kunigaikštystę, Trakų miestą su pilimis, kuriose įsikūręs Trakų istorijos muziejus! Išradingas ir sumanus gidas Jus lydės visos kelionės laiku metu, nuspės klausimus, suteikdamas žinių bei dar labiau pažadins smalsumą, kviesdamas apsilankyti dar kartą.\r\nGal nustebsite sužinoję, kad viduramžiais su Trakų vardu buvo siejamos trys pilys? Visos buvo mūrinės, visos apsuptos vandens – natūralių telkinių ir dirbtinai suformuotų perkasų. Dabar jas vadiname Senųjų Trakų, Trakų Pusiasalio ir Trakų Salos pilimis.\r\nPažintis prasideda trečiojoje, garsiausioje ir geriausiai išlikusioje – gotikinėje Salos pilyje. Pilies sala suformuota dirbtinai – sujungus tris atskiras, atskirtas durpyno, užpelkėjusio ežero ir pakrančių vandens, saleles. Konvento tipo kunigaikščių rūmai su aukščiausiu – 33 metrų aukščio – bokštu (vadinamu donžonu) ir gynybinėmis atraminėmis sienomis, suformuojant terasą, yra dviejų aukštų, su pusrūsiais ir gynybine pastoge. Gyvenamuosius aukštus juosia medinės galerijos. Iš jų durys veda į devynias menes, kuriose gyveno kunigaikščio šeima, svita ir svečiai, ir į visą aukštą užimančią didžiąją, arba reprezentacinę, menę. Pusrūsyje po ja buvo įrengta virtuvė, priešingoje pusėje, kitame korpuso pusrūsyje, – iždinė. Iš kiemelio matomos pusrūsiuose esančios orinio šildymo pakuros, ant originalaus tinko pilyje visur randama polichrominės tapybos likučių.\r\nTrakų istorijos muziejaus ekspozicija prasideda kairiajame sparne, vadinamosiose „Vytautinėse“ menėse, kuriose, manoma, apsistodavęs Didysis kunigaikštis su žmona. Vitrinose eksponuojami archeologiniai radiniai – šachmatų figūrėlės, Venecijos stiklo šukės, daugiaspalvės glazūros kokliai – byloja, kad XV amžiuje pilis buvo puošniai ir prabangiai įrengta, joje vykdavo įvairios pramogos, šventės, įšventinimai į riterius. Arbaletų strėlių antgaliai – dažnas archeologų radinys – byloja apie intensyvias kovas. Dar daugiau įvairios istorinės ginkluotės pavyzdžių galima apžiūrėti ekspozicijos vitrinose, klausantis nuodugnaus ir informatyvaus šios programėlės pasakojimo. Visą dešiniojo sparno pirmą aukštą užimanti didžioji, arba reprezentacinė, menė – svarbiausia ir puošniausia pilies patalpa. Tai, kad Lietuvos Didžioji Kunigaikštystė XV ir XVI amžiais buvo didžiausia savo plotu Europos valstybė, įrodoma senovės kartografų sukurtais žemėlapiais, o Trakų miesto ir  pilių grožis – pavaizduotas istorinėse graviūrose ir paveiksluose. Trumpai pristatoma XX amžiaus Salos pilies restauravimo istorija: vitražai, kaip ir kai kurie kiti architektūriniai sprendimai (grindų plytelių, medinių galerijų raštai), atkuriant buvo stilizuoti pagal ankstyvosios gotikos analogus.\r\nModernėjantis Trakų istorijos muziejus kiekvienais metais skiria daug dėmesio interaktyvioms pramogoms, įvairaus pobūdžio edukacijoms, nuolat surengia įdomių parodų, renginių ar atnaujina ilgalaikes ekspozicijas. Mūsų tikslas – įdomus, gyvas, nuolat besikeičiantis muziejus.\r\nKviečiame apsilankyti dar ne kartą. Tapkime gerais draugais!"

Don't want to look up at the boards? Just tap 'Get Notifications' and relax. We'll notify you the second we learn your platform. At the latest, this will be a few seconds BEFORE it appears on the departure boards in the station. Sometimes we'll predict it up to 5 hours before! Now you'll always beat the rush and get a seat, and you don't need to stand there staring up at the departure board for hours.\n\nIs your train delayed? You can see exactly where your train is en-route, see where it's been, and when it's due. This includes the points in-between passenger stations that aren't reported in other train apps.\n\nDo you commute? Add your commute as a Widget and always see the next 5 trains at a glance. The Widget can be set to reverse at midday too, to show your journey back home.\n\nGot an iPhone with the Dynamic Island?

This NEW improved, paid version will help create more technology projects for the people of Chepstow and the surrounding areas.\nMore features are on their way for Enviroute, and we'll be adding surrounding roads / routes such as the M49 along with routes into Bristol, the M5, and more.\nIf you don't know about the original problems commuters have experienced with the Severn crossings, read on for some background...\nThe Severn bridges based between England and wales are major connections for the M4 and M48 motorways. Traditionally both crossings / bridges have been owned and operated by private companies.\n\n“Is the bridge open” and Enviroute have created an app that allows local residents and commuters to check the status of both bridges in order to plan their routes more effectively. From time to time the bridges are closed due to maintenance and/or adverse weather conditions and, since the ownership of the Severn bridges has changed there has been a lack of reliable communications around the status of the M48 Severn bridge and the M4 Severn Bridge.\n\n“Is the bridge open” is here to help with this and to provide information on when either of the Severn Bridges are closed or partially closed.\nSevern bridge updates at the touch of a button instead of endless maps, websites or twitter accounts. \nFind out instantly is the Severn Bridge is open and get updates sent directly to your device (Enviroute NEW now has this feature!) before you set off on your journey.\nBy paying for Enviroute NEW you are indirectly funding this local area for more exciting tech based projects.  We want to make life easier for residents of the surrounding areas, help local businesses sell more, save your local high-streets plus many more projects in the pipeline.  These will be funded by the money earned by Enviroute NEW\nThank you and I hope you enjoy the new version."

Every year thousands come to reach the top of at least one or to conquer all three in one go. \n\n\r\nThe app contains route details for the classic 24-mile circular walk, route maps for the individual peaks, Whernside, Pen-y-ghent and Ingleborough and four other shorter walks in the Three Peaks area. Don’t just come for the day, come for the stay and explore more of this spectacular area and its scenery.  \n\n\r\nThis GPS enabled app provides reassurance as you follow the arrow along your chosen route. It will also show you how far you are around the route. \n\n\r\nThis app has been developed alongside our National Park Yorkshire Three Peaks Rangers who have added points of interest along the routes for you. \n\n\r\nThe app also includes important safety advice and the code of conduct, which will help  you stay safe on the walks and help protect our  local communities. \n\n\r\nThe app is not a mapping tool. You must take other forms of navigation with you and know how to use them. We recommend you have an OS Explorer OL2 Yorkshire Dales (Southern and Western) map with you. \n\n\r\nUsing GPS tracking uses more of your battery than normal – do not rely solely on this app when walking.  \n\n\r\nAlways be prepared, conditions can change rapidly in an upland area such as the Three Peaks. \n\n\r\nYou must read the safety information contained in this app before using the route information.  \n  \r\nThe Yorkshire Three Peaks are very fragile environments, and the public rights of way network is under pressure from the hundreds of thousands of visitors that come to enjoy it each year. Maintaining the paths in the Yorkshire Three Peaks area costs on average £35 per metre. \n\n\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this app all go towards helping the Yorkshire Dales National Park with this work. \n\n\r\n\r\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\r\n\r\nContains OpenStreetMap Data © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\r\nhttps://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright \n\n\r\n\r\nThis walking app was developed for the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority by the team at Local Walks - www.localwalks.co.uk \n\n\r\n\r\nApp terms and conditions:\r\nhttps://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/apptermsandconditions"

With your trusty Vegan Passport, you can be sure of finding vegan food in restaurants around the globe.\n\nThis multilingual vegan guide is a must-have for globetrotting vegans. It’s small enough to slip into your pocket, but big enough to include the languages of over 96% of the world’s population.\n\nThe fifth edition of this essential guide has been updated and expanded, and now boasts 78 languages including Hausa, Igbo, Xhosa and Zulu.\n\nIncluding fail-safe pictures, which can be used when words don’t work, the Vegan Passport has all situations covered. This will ensure that you have no problem explaining what you do and don’t eat, no matter where you are in the world.\n\nWhen visiting a restaurant, show your waiter the relevant entry from this app, and ask them to read it.  Do not attempt to pronounce the text yourself!  If you are invited to a private home for a meal, show your host the relevant entry well in advance.  \n\nIf booking a hotel by post or email, send a copy of the relevant page.  Please note that several languages may be used in the place you are visiting, so you may be able to offer the reader a choice of languages.  \n\nIf all else fails then you can show them the images depicting what a vegan eats and what a vegan does not eat.\n\nWhen booking flights then you can refer to the below airplane meal code to request a vegan meal when booking.\n\nThe Vegan Society is a registered charity and the oldest vegan society in the world, founded on 1 November 1944, in the UK by Donald Watson.\n\nWhat do we want? Simple: a world where humans do not exploit non-human animals. A world where animals are free to exist in their own right. We promote a lifestyle that excludes, as far as possible and practical, all forms of exploitation of - and cruelty to - animals for the purposes of food, clothing or anything else.\n\nWe also want a just world for humans. A world where resources are utilised in a sustainable way to ensure all current and future generations are provided for - a world where no one goes hungry. At the heart of the sustainability and food justice agenda is plant-based food production and consumption: veganism."

No hidden costs.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino del Norte from Irún to Santiago de Compostela and includes all of the alternate routes along the way. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Enter your flight details, and using real flight data, the app perfectly demonstrates the unlikelihood of your flight going down.\n\nHow safe is your next flight? \n\nCrashes may make the headlines, but they’re incredibly rare, and when they do happen, seldom lead to injury. With those facts, there’s no need for nervous flyers to fall back on anything but the statistics. Am I Going Down? will tell you how and why you have only a millions-to-one chance of crashing, allowing you to fight fear with information.  \n\nNew York Times\n“In most cases a normal flight will give you a one in five million, or one in 10 million, chance of crashing, so that tends to reassure most people.”\n\nThe Economist\n\"[The app] wants to reassure nervous flyers that they are all but guaranteed to reach their destination in one piece.\"\n\nDaily Mail\n\"'Am I Going Down?' app uses real flight statistics to analyse flight safety.\"\n\nBustle\n\"One of the only sources providing such in-depth coverage of safety statistics in the aviation world.\"\n\nAlso featured in: CNN, Washington Post, Daily Telegraph, Quartz, Forbes, Newsweek, Gizmodo, Business Insider, Gadget Show, and many more! \n\n—\nDisclaimer: While \"Am I Going Down?\" is based on published flight and crash statistics to give an indication of flight safety, the app is intended for entertainment purposes only.

No Login. \n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Francés, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "TrekRight – Camino Francés is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking or bicycling the historic Camino de Santiago (specifically, the Camino Francés and the extension from Santiago to Finisterre / Fisterra). \n\nTrekRight includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, albergues, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed *offline* maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass with a built-in yellow arrow that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\n--- The Right Information, When You Need It ---\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching Puente la Reina, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what attractions are available around you, where you can find a water fountain, options for where to stay the night, easy access to interactive elevation profile charts, and clear, detailed directions. You can easily see what things you flagged as interesting, which things you added notes to, and which you marked as favorites. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n--- Caminopedia ---\nTrekRight’s ‘Camino Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information, organized into Communities, Shelters, Attractions, Services, Points of Interest, and Route Sections. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n--- Interactive Offline Maps ---\nPowerful, flexible map that displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Caminopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Caminopedia entry). Easily filter and do searches. Detailed, high-quality offline maps are included, so you have full access to maps even without Internet access. When you do have an Internet connection, online maps are also available which can be configured to show street maps, satellite view, terrain, or a hybrid. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the Camino.\n\n--- Intelligent Compass ---\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Two special compass indicators are available – one points towards the end point of your current section (typically the next town on the route), and the other points which way you should go *now*, taking into consideration your current position and all the twists and turns in your route. Never get lost again!\n\n--- Pre-Camino Planning & Preparation ---\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes including those touted by Brierley and Eroski. Review and rank albergues, flag locations of interest, add your own notes, and more.\n\n--- Up-To-Date Content ---\nTrekRight’s content is regularly updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps. No Internet connection is required!"

      "label": "This app is the culmination of over 40 years travelling and writing about the Greek islands. It covers all the inhabited Greek islands (and some fascinating uninhabited ones), bringing out their unique personalities, history, mythology, their archaeological and historical sites, their beaches, gorges, mountains, and waterfalls (yes, there are some!), their beautiful villages and churches.\n\nIt’s a handy companion for visiting the islands, but also useful for first timers, with a detailed section to help you decide where to go. Do you want to be on a beach within hours of landing in Greece, or ready to take the time to seek out a peaceful speck in the sea to write your next novel? Are you keen to walk up ancient cobbled paths to mysterious dragon houses, or soak in a hot spring? Dive the wreck of the Titanic’s sister ship, walk on a volcano, or wander through Greece’s Bronze age Pompeii, and find what’s behind those haunting Cretan myths?\n\nDana Facaros set off in 1977 at age 19 to write the first complete guide to the islands (she got the job mainly because her father comes from Ikaria!). Her guide, then called Greek Island Hopping, was the bible for many travellers back in the day, and the Cadogan guide version, the basis of this app went through nine editions. Since then she has written countless articles for newspapers and magazines about the Greek islands, or co-co-authored over 40 guidebooks, including the recent Bradt Guide to Northern Greece."

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Containing all the content from the the best-selling travel book \"Wild Swimming\" by Daniel Start (Wild Things Publishing £16.99, second edition, 2013) this app provides all you need to visit hundreds of magical rivers, lakes and waterfalls across the UK. \n\nIn this great British tour you’ll be able to swim with otters in Devon, go river-tubing in Yorkshire, night-swim under the stars in Oxfordshire and learn how to build a woodland sauna. In each area you can ready background chapters on famous wild-swimmers of the past and read stories of heroes, lovers and ordinary folk who have long enjoyed bathing under the willows. Perfect whether you are a wild swimmer, family paddler or just enjoy a waterside picnic.\n\nNOTE: due to the large number of images and places the app is slow to load first time and may not work well (or crash) if many other apps are open in parallel. Please close other apps.\n\nYou will find preloaded maps, photos, directions and travel writing to inspire and inform. Most locations comes with stunning photography and some include detailed mapping (at 1:25,000 to help walkers and 1:250,000 to help with route-planning). There is contact information for nearby pubs, campsites and attractions. If you need inspiration you can browse the app by slideshow, list, photo gallery and on an interactive map. Ask the app to find places close to you, or search using postcode, address, star rating, walk-in time, keywords or other features. You can share places on email and Facebook and save favourites too."

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales; with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

The app uses AR to measure the size of your bag and compare it with the maximum size allowed by your airline to see if it fits. It supports over 50 airlines and also allows you to set your custom maximum allowed size.\nWe know that most of the time people don't have a way to measure the bags until they get on the airport, but at that point it is too late. Luggage fit solves that problem for you and gives your peace of mind that you won't have any issues with your baggage size."

      "label": "Take this guide with you when riding the Munda Biddi Trail. It has all the information you need to both navigate and prepare for the Trail. It's built by local Western Australians who have ridden the Trail several times and LOVE bike packing!\n\nThe guide works 100% without needing mobile phone reception or Internet access. The offline maps are very detailed, show the Munda Biddi Trail, show where you are via GPS, and are marked up with huts, camping areas, places to get water, alternative accommodation and many points of interest. The App map shows you how many kilometres you are from places like huts and towns, and has an interactive elevation graph so you can see what hills are between you and places. \n\nThe App has advice on how to prepare for your trip, what gear to bring, what bike to ride and suitable food. It's a complete \"how to do the trail\" guide. It has many other features, photos and information, as described below.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Very detailed offline maps. They ALWAYS work, even when mobile phone coverage and Internet are not available.\n- The map is tuned to look great on a small phone screen and show details that a cyclist in the bush needs. You'll see details such as minor tracks and trails at zoom levels where most other maps hide them. So zoom out and tracks don't disappear from your map! This makes following trail redirections easy. And getting back to the trail if you lose it becomes trivial. Great for your safety and easier for you to navigate even with a tiny screen.\n- The map has contour lines.\n-  Uses GPS to show your location on the map.\n- The map has extra markers for huts, towns, camping areas, places where you can get food, attractions, swimming spots and other points of interest.\n- Tap places on the map and be shown your distance from them along the track. See how far away that hut is!\n- An elevation graph that you can zoom-and-swipe to see all the hills and valleys along the trail. \n- The elevation graph shows your location and markers for towns, huts and other places. Do I have to ride up any big hills to get to that hut?\n- Tap hut, town, camping and other markers on the map to get detailed information and photographs for those places.\n- Includes a map showing places where you can get drinking water. And a map showing toilets along the trail.\n- Has descriptions and pictures of each section of the Trail.\n- Provides detailed information on paid accommodation options outside towns. For those who want a bit more luxury than camping!\n- Has a trail overview, and information about the huts, drinking water, safety, weather, animals and history of the Munda Biddi Trail.\n- Detailed advice and information on how to train for a multi-day trip, choosing a bike, when to ride, what gear you need and suitable food.\n- Shows bike shops and other places that can supply bike parts or fix problems.\n- Describes transportation options such as buses and companies that provide shuttle services.\n- No mobile phone coverage or internet is needed for the App to work. Put your phone in Airplane Mode to save battery power and continue to use the App (your phone's GPS will still work in Airplane Mode).\n- The App turns off GPS when the screen is turned off, so will not use phone power when you are not using it.\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Trail to inspire you!\n\nYou should never get lost because the maps always work and show you where you are, even when you stray from the Trail. The great detail on the maps make it easy to follow bush tracks and paths to get back to the Trail.\n\nThis App was built by a small Western Australian software company. We've ridden the Trail and have extensive bike packing experience. We're confident our Munda Biddi Trail Guide App will make your trip easier to plan, safer and more fun.\n\nA portion of the earnings from this App are given to the Munda Biddi Trail Foundation."

Use the digital crown to zoom in/out and touch & drag on the screen to move around the map.\n\nUnfiltered Flight Data\nPlaneWatcher shows you all aircraft, unfiltered, unlike most major flight tracking apps. Made possible by our amazing data provider ADSBExchange, the world's largest source of unfiltered flight data.\n\nLocal & Worldwide\nView aircraft around your current location or jump to any airport in the world. Use the digital crown to zoom in on a busy LAX or watch aircraft taking off and landing at JFK.\n\nAircraft Details\nSimply tap on an aircraft to see all its details: flight name, registration, type, category, operator, altitude, speeds and more (depending on data availability).\n\nAircraft Following\nInterested in a single aircraft? Follow it as it proceeds among the other traffic. Just tap the small blue dot to exit follow mode and return to the main map.\n\nMultiple Filters\nJust want to see aircraft below 10'000 feet, Boeing 747s or only planes from a certain airline? You can filter by altitude, type, callsign or registration. Filters can be combined, too.\n\nCustomizability\nCustomize the display using many options. You only want to see helicopters and hide all small airports? You can do that and much more...\n\nComplications Support\nWith many different complications available, designed to fit into all color schemes, PlaneWatcher is always just a tap away.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.planewatcher.app/privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://www.planewatcher.app/terms.html"

Point your phone in the approximate direction that the track is running and see the estimated, interpolated position and distance of trains from your nearest station as beacons overlaid on-screen in AR (augmented reality).\n\nFind Great Britain real-time train times almost instantly from your nearest stations. Displays platform information where available. Automatically loads train times from your nearest station or loads train times from a station that you select from the stations screen. Filter train times by destination station to quickly find the timetable and live real-time train time information that you’re looking for.\n\nFuturistic high tech features\n\nWidgets - requires iOS 14 or higher\n\nEasily see train times, cancellations, rail incidents and service status on your homescreen.\n\nIncidents\n\nEasily see information about the service status and news about rail incidents and current / future planned maintenance. The incidents screen includes information such as the incident details, routes affected, date/s of incident and direct links to the relevent National Rail Enquiries page and map, where available.\n\nAR (augmented reality) mode - requires iOS 13 or higher\n\nPicture real-time train information in an interactive real-world environment. See nearby trains and railway stations in an immersive augmented reality experience. The app will locate trains that are departing from your nearest station and display them. Tapping on a train reveals more information about its calling points and last reported location. AR mode is available on iOS 13 or higher.\n\nTrain Tracker\n\nUsing it’s advanced geo-location capabilities, combined with real-time train data and it’s UK rail network map, the app predicts the estimated, interpolated location of trains at any given time. The estimated train location is displayed on a map, with information about whether the service is currently running early, on-time or late.\n\nHigh precision information\n\nThe app can report times from intermediary passing points such as junctions, providing you with a high level of precision and accuracy about the current status of a given train’s journey. Packed with detailed train information like number of carriages, train category, power type (eg Electric Multiple Unit), timing load (eg Class 323), planned maximum speed (eg 90mph max), seating classes, reservations, catering, and operating characteristics (eg Driver Only Operation). Please note that this information is only available if this data has been supplied by the Train Operating Company. Some TOCs do not supply carriage data.\n\nCustomer Feedback\n\n\"Thanks to the JUST bought @TrainBeacon app, light bags and running legs trained with @LondonCityAC - just swapped trains at READING, with 2 minutes crossover time. All makes for a GREAT #SundayMorning! #Staycation adventure to #Cornwall” - James Moyse - Journalist at Sky News\n\n\"@TrainBeacon who’s behind this app?? You’ve satisfied my nerdy needs and I am so impressed as to how slick it is. Well done”\n\n\"love the AR mode\"\n\nSafety Information\n\nNot for use in safety critical applications, level crossings, etc. Train position is estimated from latest available timing point data and may be incorrect. Care must be taken during use. Other trains may be present that are not indicated in the AR or train tracker mode of the app such as trains not stopping at the nearest station and also freight trains. Freight and non passenger trains are not displayed in the app. For your safety do not use your phone while you walk and take extreme care using the app near trains and railways.\n\nHardware requirements\n\n* AR mode and the augmented reality features of the app require iOS 13 or higher, and an iPhone 6S, SE or later device, or an iPad 2017 or later. Widgets require iOS 14 or higher *\n\nApp powered by National Rail Enquiries and contains information of Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd"

      "label": "TrekRight: Camino Portugués is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking all or part of the Portugués route of the Camino de Santiago.\n\nTrekRight includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, albergues / hotels, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed offline maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\nThis app includes:\n- Detailed coverage of the Portugués from Porto northward, including the Central route plus growing coverage of the Coastal and Senda Litoral routes. \n- In-depth coverage is available for the popular Variante Espiritual option as well as some other alternatives. \n- Limited coverage is available for the Lisbon to Porto route, currently including the route itself, most albergues, and geo-located communities. \n- Offline maps (including with this purchase) for Porto to Santiago, including Central, Coastal, and Senda Litoral variants.\n- Offline maps are also available via in-app purchase for Lisbon to Porto. \n\nLet us know if you are interested in other Portugués variants and we'll try to add them as well.  \n\n# The Right Information, When You Need it\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching a community, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what points of interest are available around you, where you can find a restaurant, and so on. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n# Trekopedia\nTrekRight’s ‘Camino Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n# Interactive Map / Offline Maps\nPowerful, flexible maps built on top of our high-quality mapping engine, with full support for detailed offline map imagery. Displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the trail.\n\n# Intelligent Compass\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Never get lost again!\n\n# Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank albergues / hotels, flag locations of interest as ‘favourites’, add your own notes, and more. Be prepared!\n\n# Up-To-Date Content\nTrekRight’s content is regularly being updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps. Once the offline maps are downloaded, no Internet connection is required."

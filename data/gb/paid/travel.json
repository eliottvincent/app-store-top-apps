      "label": "The Three Peaks of Pen-y-ghent, Ingleborough and Whernside are among the best-known in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Every year thousands come to reach the top of at least one or to conquer all three in one go. \n\n\r\nThe app contains route details for the classic 24-mile circular walk, route maps for the individual peaks, Whernside, Pen-y-ghent and Ingleborough and four other shorter walks in the Three Peaks area. Don’t just come for the day, come for the stay and explore more of this spectacular area and its scenery.  \n\n\r\nThis GPS enabled app provides reassurance as you follow the arrow along your chosen route. It will also show you how far you are around the route. \n\n\r\nThis app has been developed alongside our National Park Yorkshire Three Peaks Rangers who have added points of interest along the routes for you. \n\n\r\nThe app also includes important safety advice and the code of conduct, which will help  you stay safe on the walks and help protect our  local communities. \n\n\r\nThe app is not a mapping tool. You must take other forms of navigation with you and know how to use them. We recommend you have an OS Explorer OL2 Yorkshire Dales (Southern and Western) map with you. \n\n\r\nUsing GPS tracking uses more of your battery than normal – do not rely solely on this app when walking.  \n\n\r\nAlways be prepared, conditions can change rapidly in an upland area such as the Three Peaks. \n\n\r\nYou must read the safety information contained in this app before using the route information.  \n  \r\nThe Yorkshire Three Peaks are very fragile environments, and the public rights of way network is under pressure from the hundreds of thousands of visitors that come to enjoy it each year. Maintaining the paths in the Yorkshire Three Peaks area costs on average £35 per metre. \n\n\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this app all go towards helping the Yorkshire Dales National Park with this work. \n\n\r\n\r\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\r\n\r\nContains OpenStreetMap Data © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\r\nhttps://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright \n\n\r\n\r\nThis walking app was developed for the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority by the team at Local Walks - www.localwalks.co.uk \n\n\r\n\r\nApp terms and conditions:\r\nhttps://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/apptermsandconditions"

      "label": "Take this guide with you when walking the Cape to Cape Track. It has all the information you need to both navigate and prepare for the Track. It's built by local Western Australians who have walked the Track several times and live only a few km from the Track. We know the area!\r\n\r\nThe guide works 100% without needing mobile phone reception or Internet access. The offline maps are very detailed, show the Cape to Cape Track, show where you are via GPS, and are marked up with camping areas, sightseeing, water sources, places to swim, some accommodation, restaurants and food shops, the best beachs, sights and many other points of interest. The App shows you how many kilometres you are from places like camping area and towns, and has an interactive elevation graph so you can see what hills are between you and places. \r\n\r\nThe App has advice on how to prepare for your trip, what gear to bring, when to walk, possible itineraries and suitable food. It has many other features, photos and information, as described below.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n- Very detailed offline maps. They ALWAYS work, even when mobile phone coverage and Internet are not available.\r\n- The map is tuned to look great on a small phone screen and show details that a walker in the bush needs. You'll see details such as minor tracks at map zoom levels where most other maps hide them. So zoom out and tracks don't disappear from your map! Great for your safety and easier for you to navigate even with a tiny screen.\r\n- Contour lines are shown on the map as you zoom in a little.\r\n- Uses GPS to show your location.\r\n- The map has extra markers for towns, camping areas, sights, places where you can get food, attractions, swimming spots and other points of interest.\r\n- Map markers also show you where to get water and the location of toilets.\r\n- Tap place markers on the map and be shown your distance from them along the track. See how far away that camping area is!\r\n- An elevation graph that you can zoom-and-swipe to see all the hills and valleys along the track. \r\n- The elevation graph shows your location and has markers for towns, camping and other places. Use it to see if you have to walk up any big hills to get to that next camping area?\r\n- Tap town, sightseeing, camping and other markers on the map to get detailed information and photographs for those places.\r\n- Has descriptions and pictures of each section of the Track.\r\n- Provides information on paid accommodation options. For those who want a bit more luxury than camping!\r\n- Has a track overview, and information about camping, drinking water, safety, weather, animals and history of the Cape to Cape Track.\r\n- Detailed advice and information on how to prepare for a multi-day trip, when to do your trip, what gear you need and suitable food.\r\n- Describes transportation options such as buses and companies that provide shuttle services.\r\n- No mobile phone coverage or internet is needed for the App to work. Put your phone in Airplane Mode to save battery power and continue to use the App (your phone's GPS will still work in Airplane Mode).\r\n- The App turns off GPS when the screen is turned off, so will not use phone power when you are not using it.\r\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Track to inspire you!\r\n\r\nYou should never get lost because the maps always work and show you where you are, even when you stray from the Track. The great detail on the maps make it easy to follow bush tracks and paths to get back to the track.\r\n\r\nThis App was built by a small Western Australian software company located only 8 km from the northern termination of the Track. We know the track and the area intimately. We're confident our Cape to Cape Track Guide App will make your trip easier to plan, safer and more fun."

Find your way from any its 44 car parks and discover the stories behind their unusual names too!\n\nTen walking trails will take you to all corners of the Forest: follow in the footsteps of Pooh, visit the Airman's Grave or take a Walk Amongst Friends.\n\nAshdown Forest, the largest free public access space in the South East of England, lies at the heart of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. For nearly 2000 years the Forest was also exploited for the iron industry, leading to the creation of the heathland landscape that covers two thirds of the area. Ashdown Forest is rich in history and wildlife. Use this app to start exploring.\n\nThere are no photographs, audio or video to ensure the size of this app is kept really small.\n\nThe app makes use of GPS to show you places of interest close to your current location. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Whilst this app will work on devices without GPS, such as a Wi-Fi only iPad, you may not be able to use all location features."

      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button. You can swipe through all your favorites on the main calculation interface just as you swipe the pages on the iPhone’s home screen.\n\n== Charts and Historic Rates==\neCurrency provides detailed historical charts for all exchange rates.

You can turn off automatic updates to avoid roaming costs. The conversion and calculation functionally works completely offline using the latest downloaded exchange rates; the display of historical charts requires an active internet connection.\n\n==Rates Provider==\neCurrency is not dependant on any single data-source. The application obtains its exchange rates from our self-developed Currency-Provider-engine that aggregates rates data from multiple sources to secure the reliability of exchange rate updates.\n\n== Tutorial & Support==\nOn the first startup a short self-running demo is displayed to introduce you to the app. We appreciate any reviews or comments you may have on eCurrency in iTunes. If you have any questions please contact us directly, as we are unable to respond to your enquiries via iTunes."

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

No hidden costs.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino del Norte from Irún to Santiago de Compostela and includes all of the alternate routes along the way. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Containing all the content from the the best-selling travel book \"Wild Swimming\" by Daniel Start (Wild Things Publishing £16.99, second edition, 2013) this app provides all you need to visit hundreds of magical rivers, lakes and waterfalls across the UK. \n\nIn this great British tour you’ll be able to swim with otters in Devon, go river-tubing in Yorkshire, night-swim under the stars in Oxfordshire and learn how to build a woodland sauna. In each area you can ready background chapters on famous wild-swimmers of the past and read stories of heroes, lovers and ordinary folk who have long enjoyed bathing under the willows. Perfect whether you are a wild swimmer, family paddler or just enjoy a waterside picnic.\n\nNOTE: due to the large number of images and places the app is slow to load first time and may not work well (or crash) if many other apps are open in parallel. Please close other apps.\n\nYou will find preloaded maps, photos, directions and travel writing to inspire and inform. Most locations comes with stunning photography and some include detailed mapping (at 1:25,000 to help walkers and 1:250,000 to help with route-planning). There is contact information for nearby pubs, campsites and attractions. If you need inspiration you can browse the app by slideshow, list, photo gallery and on an interactive map. Ask the app to find places close to you, or search using postcode, address, star rating, walk-in time, keywords or other features. You can share places on email and Facebook and save favourites too."

      "label": "TrekRight: Cotswold Way is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking all or part of England's Cotswold Way long-distance trail or exploring the beautiful region surrounding it.\n\nIt includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, B&Bs / hotels, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed offline maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\n# The Right Information, When You Need it\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching a community, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what points of interest are available around you, where you can find a pub, and so on. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n# Trekopedia\nTrekRight’s ‘Cotswold Way Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n# Interactive Map / Offline Maps\nPowerful, flexible maps built on top of our high-quality mapping engine, with full support for detailed offline map imagery. Displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the trail.\n\n# Intelligent Compass\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Two special compass indicators are available – one points towards the end point of your current section (typically the next town on the route), and the other points which way you should go now, taking into consideration all the twists and turns in your route. Never get lost again!\n\n# Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank hotels / B&Bs, flag locations of interest as ‘favourites’, add your own notes, and more. Be prepared!\n\n# Up-To-Date Content\nTrekRight’s content is regularly being updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- Spotlight Integration ---\nTrekRight's content is fully indexed by iOS's amazing Spotlight search feature. Without even needing to open TrekRight, just call up Spotlight (swipe downwards from near the top of your phone's Home screen), enter what you are interested in, and if Spotlight finds it in TrekRight you simply press on a link to open that item. This works even if TrekRight isn't running and it works entirely offline! (iPhone 5 or later and iOS 9 or later needed for this feature).\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps (once downloaded). No Internet connection is required unless you want to use the online maps."

Some TOCs do not supply carriage data.\n\nCustomer Feedback\n\n\"Thanks to the JUST bought @TrainBeacon app, light bags and running legs trained with @LondonCityAC - just swapped trains at READING, with 2 minutes crossover time. All makes for a GREAT #SundayMorning! #Staycation adventure to #Cornwall” - James Moyse - Journalist at Sky News\n\n\"@TrainBeacon who’s behind this app?? You’ve satisfied my nerdy needs and I am so impressed as to how slick it is. Well done”\n\n\"love the AR mode\"\n\nSafety Information\n\nNot for use in safety critical applications, level crossings, etc. Train position is estimated from latest available timing point data and may be incorrect. Care must be taken during use. Other trains may be present that are not indicated in the AR or train tracker mode of the app such as trains not stopping at the nearest station and also freight trains. Freight and non passenger trains are not displayed in the app. For your safety do not use your phone while you walk and take extreme care using the app near trains and railways.\n\nHardware requirements\n\n* AR mode and the augmented reality features of the app require iOS 13 or higher, and an iPhone 6S, SE or later device, or an iPad 2017 or later. Widgets require iOS 14 or higher *\n\nApp powered by National Rail Enquiries and contains information of Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd"

      "label": "Ever been stood at a Bus Stop wondering when the next bus is? Or sat at home / in the pub wondering if you need to set off yet? There are a couple of way to do this if you are in Yorkshire, but none are specifically aimed at the iPhone.\n\n1.Text the 8 digit bus stop number to 63876 (A text message is charged at your standard outbound rate plus a maximum of 12p for the returned text.) \n\n2.Use the \"YourNextBus Service\" at  http://www.wymetro.com/yournextbus/search/ in Mobile Safari (What a hassle to navigate and remember all your stop numbers)\n\nNow you can have a dedicated app which will store your favourite Bus Stop numbers and present the results in an iPhone / iPad friendly format. With lots of useful features some of which are not available on the web …\n\n• Where available get the REAL arrival time of the busses, not timetabled times, but the actual time the bus is due at your chosen stop via the GPS tracker on the bus.\n• Check future arrival times by using the +1hr/-1hr buttons to move an hour or more along the schedules. \n• Store a list of \"Favourite Stops\" and organise them in Alphabetical order or simply order / rename them as you like.\n• Busses with a Live Feed will have their times highlighted in green and show how many minutes until they are due.\n• Busses with a Low Floor access for pushchairs and prams are indicated by a blue wheelchair icon on the end of the result.\n• You can tap on results to be alerted at your specified number of minutes before the bus is due, so you know when to set off.\n• Set an Auto-Refresh time to regularly reload the timetable data (Double Tap at the top of the timetable to enable).\n• The app will offer to fall back to SMS if you don't have a Data Connection on your phone.\n• Optional Shake to refresh and pull down on the results to refresh times.\n• Search for Busses / Stops by Postcode, Bus Number, or search for other bus stops near your current stop.\n• Use your phone's GPS to show a map of all the bus stops around you. \n• Our app uses the \"text-only\" version of the YourNextBus page and doesn't download images etc, this makes its very quick and saves on your data usage.\n• Large Text view for Sight Impaired users of iPads (enabled in the settings).\n\nIMPORTANT - Before purchasing we suggest you use the West Yorkshire Public Transport site linked above to make sure you can see information on the busses and stops you require. We can only provide the same information, so if you cannot find relevant information on their websites, our app will not be able to magically provide it. \n\nWe have thoroughly tested in Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield, Harrogate, Doncaster, Scarborough and York but please ensure your area is covered before purchase.\n\nPlease don't shoot the messenger by leaving negative reviews regarding the actual Bus Times data we display, this is from the WYPTE website and we can only show the data they offer. If the times are wrong, or the bus doesn’t turn up, then the problem is with their data or services and not our wonderful app! :)\n\n\nIf you have any suggestions or in the unlikely event of a problem please contact us via the Icons on the Service Status tab (Email, Twitter, Facebook, WWW). We cannot reply to comments left in the ratings on here, but we can assure you that you will receive a swift personal reply to any comments you send us via the Application.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimetable information provided by West Yorkshire Public Transport Executive (WYPTE).\nNote: Neither this application or its author is associated with or endorsed by WYPTE."

It has the first trains, the last trains and all the trains in between!\n\nJust choose your departure station and you’ll immediately see the last three trains of the day from that station. But it’s just as easy to check the first trains of the day, or the time of the next scheduled train. Choose a train and you’ll see all the stations it stops at and how long the journey will take. You can even check to see if you’ll have time to interchange with another line at one of the stops.\n\nTube Times does not need internet access, all the data is built-in, so it works fine underground or on an iPod touch. It contains data for all the Tube lines and the DLR, but does not currently include the London Overground.\n\nIMPORTANT: Tube Times does not display any live train time information. Its timetable is based on data published by Transport for London, and actual train times will be affected by line closures, engineering work and other delays, so check before you travel.\n\nPlease get in touch if you have any questions or feedback: support@tubetimesapp.com or @tubetimes on Twitter."

This NEW improved, paid version will help create more technology projects for the people of Chepstow and the surrounding areas.\nMore features are on their way for Enviroute, and we'll be adding surrounding roads / routes such as the M49 along with routes into Bristol, the M5, and more.\nIf you don't know about the original problems commuters have experienced with the Severn crossings, read on for some background...\nThe Severn bridges based between England and wales are major connections for the M4 and M48 motorways. Traditionally both crossings / bridges have been owned and operated by private companies.\n\n“Is the bridge open” and Enviroute have created an app that allows local residents and commuters to check the status of both bridges in order to plan their routes more effectively. From time to time the bridges are closed due to maintenance and/or adverse weather conditions and, since the ownership of the Severn bridges has changed there has been a lack of reliable communications around the status of the M48 Severn bridge and the M4 Severn Bridge.\n\n“Is the bridge open” is here to help with this and to provide information on when either of the Severn Bridges are closed or partially closed.\nSevern bridge updates at the touch of a button instead of endless maps, websites or twitter accounts. \nFind out instantly is the Severn Bridge is open and get updates sent directly to your device (Enviroute NEW now has this feature!) before you set off on your journey.\nBy paying for Enviroute NEW you are indirectly funding this local area for more exciting tech based projects.  We want to make life easier for residents of the surrounding areas, help local businesses sell more, save your local high-streets plus many more projects in the pipeline.  These will be funded by the money earned by Enviroute NEW\nThank you and I hope you enjoy the new version."

      "label": "WiFox is a continually updated map of airport and lounge wifi passwords from around the world. In map view, you can tap any wifi icon where wireless information is available, and use the button to copy the password to the clipboard. The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use WiFox when you’re traveling.\n\n*Click Copy to easily paste passwords into wireless network settings.\n\n*Users can also add passwords they find from airports around the world. Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings. Any unused portion of a free trial will be forfeited if you purchase a subscription.

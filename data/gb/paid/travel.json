Every year thousands come to reach the top of at least one or to conquer all three in one go. \n\n\r\nThe app contains route details for the classic 24-mile circular walk, route maps for the individual peaks, Whernside, Pen-y-ghent and Ingleborough and four other shorter walks in the Three Peaks area. Don’t just come for the day, come for the stay and explore more of this spectacular area and its scenery.  \n\n\r\nThis GPS enabled app provides reassurance as you follow the arrow along your chosen route. It will also show you how far you are around the route. \n\n\r\nThis app has been developed alongside our National Park Yorkshire Three Peaks Rangers who have added points of interest along the routes for you. \n\n\r\nThe app also includes important safety advice and the code of conduct, which will help  you stay safe on the walks and help protect our  local communities. \n\n\r\nThe app is not a mapping tool. You must take other forms of navigation with you and know how to use them. We recommend you have an OS Explorer OL2 Yorkshire Dales (Southern and Western) map with you. \n\n\r\nUsing GPS tracking uses more of your battery than normal – do not rely solely on this app when walking.  \n\n\r\nAlways be prepared, conditions can change rapidly in an upland area such as the Three Peaks. \n\n\r\nYou must read the safety information contained in this app before using the route information.  \n  \r\nThe Yorkshire Three Peaks are very fragile environments, and the public rights of way network is under pressure from the hundreds of thousands of visitors that come to enjoy it each year. Maintaining the paths in the Yorkshire Three Peaks area costs on average £35 per metre. \n\n\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this app all go towards helping the Yorkshire Dales National Park with this work. \n\n\r\n\r\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\r\n\r\nContains OpenStreetMap Data © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\r\nhttps://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright \n\n\r\n\r\nThis walking app was developed for the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority by the team at Local Walks - www.localwalks.co.uk \n\n\r\n\r\nApp terms and conditions:\r\nhttps://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/apptermsandconditions"

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

This NEW improved, paid version will help create more technology projects for the people of Chepstow and the surrounding areas.\nMore features are on their way for Enviroute, and we'll be adding surrounding roads / routes such as the M49 along with routes into Bristol, the M5, and more.\nIf you don't know about the original problems commuters have experienced with the Severn crossings, read on for some background...\nThe Severn bridges based between England and wales are major connections for the M4 and M48 motorways. Traditionally both crossings / bridges have been owned and operated by private companies.\n\n“Is the bridge open” and Enviroute have created an app that allows local residents and commuters to check the status of both bridges in order to plan their routes more effectively. From time to time the bridges are closed due to maintenance and/or adverse weather conditions and, since the ownership of the Severn bridges has changed there has been a lack of reliable communications around the status of the M48 Severn bridge and the M4 Severn Bridge.\n\n“Is the bridge open” is here to help with this and to provide information on when either of the Severn Bridges are closed or partially closed.\nSevern bridge updates at the touch of a button instead of endless maps, websites or twitter accounts. \nFind out instantly is the Severn Bridge is open and get updates sent directly to your device (Enviroute NEW now has this feature!) before you set off on your journey.\nBy paying for Enviroute NEW you are indirectly funding this local area for more exciting tech based projects.  We want to make life easier for residents of the surrounding areas, help local businesses sell more, save your local high-streets plus many more projects in the pipeline.  These will be funded by the money earned by Enviroute NEW\nThank you and I hope you enjoy the new version."

Each includes extensive commentary that doesn’t just say, “Take that road because it’s good for lions,” but instead explains the geology of each area, which in turn informs the flora that grows there, the herbivores that eat that flora and, ultimately, the predators that hunt those herbivores.\n- Each route will help you develop an intimate insight into Kruger’s incredible wilderness.\n- Each of the rest camps and entrance gates is covered with short, medium and full-day routes to explore.\n\nThe Maps are the most detailed and up-to-date available:\n- They include newly opened roads and correct errors found in the maps available in the park shops. \n- For first-time visitors to Kruger, note that you are not provided with a map and must buy one from a park shop at a cost similar to this App.\n- The live GPS map means you'll never get lost.\n\nWith over half a million words of content, KrugerExplorer is the most comprehensive and unparalleled encyclopedia for the Greater Kruger ever created.\n\nSince launching in 2019, the App has had a superb reception from fans and received wonderful accolades:\n- Downloads in over 80 countries\n- App Store “App of the Day”\n- “Recommended” commendation by BirdLife South Africa\n- “Highly Recommended” by Getaway Magazine\n\nKrugerExplorer is also a global community of wildlife lovers.

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

Containing all the content from the the best-selling travel book \"Wild Swimming\" by Daniel Start (Wild Things Publishing £16.99, second edition, 2013) this app provides all you need to visit hundreds of magical rivers, lakes and waterfalls across the UK. \n\nIn this great British tour you’ll be able to swim with otters in Devon, go river-tubing in Yorkshire, night-swim under the stars in Oxfordshire and learn how to build a woodland sauna. In each area you can ready background chapters on famous wild-swimmers of the past and read stories of heroes, lovers and ordinary folk who have long enjoyed bathing under the willows. Perfect whether you are a wild swimmer, family paddler or just enjoy a waterside picnic.\n\nNOTE: due to the large number of images and places the app is slow to load first time and may not work well (or crash) if many other apps are open in parallel. Please close other apps.\n\nYou will find preloaded maps, photos, directions and travel writing to inspire and inform. Most locations comes with stunning photography and some include detailed mapping (at 1:25,000 to help walkers and 1:250,000 to help with route-planning). There is contact information for nearby pubs, campsites and attractions. If you need inspiration you can browse the app by slideshow, list, photo gallery and on an interactive map. Ask the app to find places close to you, or search using postcode, address, star rating, walk-in time, keywords or other features. You can share places on email and Facebook and save favourites too."

It’s small enough to slip into your pocket, but big enough to include the languages of over 96% of the world’s population.\n\nThe fifth edition of this essential guide has been updated and expanded, and now boasts 78 languages including Hausa, Igbo, Xhosa and Zulu.\n\nIncluding fail-safe pictures, which can be used when words don’t work, the Vegan Passport has all situations covered. This will ensure that you have no problem explaining what you do and don’t eat, no matter where you are in the world.\n\nWhen visiting a restaurant, show your waiter the relevant entry from this app, and ask them to read it.  Do not attempt to pronounce the text yourself!  If you are invited to a private home for a meal, show your host the relevant entry well in advance.  \n\nIf booking a hotel by post or email, send a copy of the relevant page.  Please note that several languages may be used in the place you are visiting, so you may be able to offer the reader a choice of languages.  \n\nIf all else fails then you can show them the images depicting what a vegan eats and what a vegan does not eat.\n\nWhen booking flights then you can refer to the below airplane meal code to request a vegan meal when booking.\n\nThe Vegan Society is a registered charity and the oldest vegan society in the world, founded on 1 November 1944, in the UK by Donald Watson.\n\nWhat do we want? Simple: a world where humans do not exploit non-human animals. A world where animals are free to exist in their own right. We promote a lifestyle that excludes, as far as possible and practical, all forms of exploitation of - and cruelty to - animals for the purposes of food, clothing or anything else.\n\nWe also want a just world for humans. A world where resources are utilised in a sustainable way to ensure all current and future generations are provided for - a world where no one goes hungry. At the heart of the sustainability and food justice agenda is plant-based food production and consumption: veganism."

No hidden costs.\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Primitivo, the original route across northern Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales; with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "Take this guide with you when riding the Munda Biddi Trail. It has all the information you need to both navigate and prepare for the Trail. It's built by local Western Australians who have ridden the Trail several times and LOVE bike packing!\n\nThe guide works 100% without needing mobile phone reception or Internet access. The offline maps are very detailed, show the Munda Biddi Trail, show where you are via GPS, and are marked up with huts, camping areas, places to get water, alternative accommodation and many points of interest. The App map shows you how many kilometres you are from places like huts and towns, and has an interactive elevation graph so you can see what hills are between you and places. \n\nThe App has advice on how to prepare for your trip, what gear to bring, what bike to ride and suitable food. It's a complete \"how to do the trail\" guide. It has many other features, photos and information, as described below.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Very detailed offline maps. They ALWAYS work, even when mobile phone coverage and Internet are not available.\n- The map is tuned to look great on a small phone screen and show details that a cyclist in the bush needs. You'll see details such as minor tracks and trails at zoom levels where most other maps hide them. So zoom out and tracks don't disappear from your map! This makes following trail redirections easy. And getting back to the trail if you lose it becomes trivial. Great for your safety and easier for you to navigate even with a tiny screen.\n- The map has contour lines.\n-  Uses GPS to show your location on the map.\n- The map has extra markers for huts, towns, camping areas, places where you can get food, attractions, swimming spots and other points of interest.\n- Tap places on the map and be shown your distance from them along the track. See how far away that hut is!\n- An elevation graph that you can zoom-and-swipe to see all the hills and valleys along the trail. \n- The elevation graph shows your location and markers for towns, huts and other places. Do I have to ride up any big hills to get to that hut?\n- Tap hut, town, camping and other markers on the map to get detailed information and photographs for those places.\n- Includes a map showing places where you can get drinking water. And a map showing toilets along the trail.\n- Has descriptions and pictures of each section of the Trail.\n- Provides detailed information on paid accommodation options outside towns. For those who want a bit more luxury than camping!\n- Has a trail overview, and information about the huts, drinking water, safety, weather, animals and history of the Munda Biddi Trail.\n- Detailed advice and information on how to train for a multi-day trip, choosing a bike, when to ride, what gear you need and suitable food.\n- Shows bike shops and other places that can supply bike parts or fix problems.\n- Describes transportation options such as buses and companies that provide shuttle services.\n- No mobile phone coverage or internet is needed for the App to work. Put your phone in Airplane Mode to save battery power and continue to use the App (your phone's GPS will still work in Airplane Mode).\n- The App turns off GPS when the screen is turned off, so will not use phone power when you are not using it.\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Trail to inspire you!\n\nYou should never get lost because the maps always work and show you where you are, even when you stray from the Trail. The great detail on the maps make it easy to follow bush tracks and paths to get back to the Trail.\n\nThis App was built by a small Western Australian software company. We've ridden the Trail and have extensive bike packing experience. We're confident our Munda Biddi Trail Guide App will make your trip easier to plan, safer and more fun.\n\nA portion of the earnings from this App are given to the Munda Biddi Trail Foundation."

No hidden costs.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino del Norte from Irún to Santiago de Compostela and includes all of the alternate routes along the way. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

You’ve satisfied my nerdy needs and I am so impressed as to how slick it is. Well done”\n\n\"love the AR mode\"\n\nSafety Information\n\nNot for use in safety critical applications, level crossings, etc. Train position is estimated from latest available timing point data and may be incorrect.

      "label": "TrekRight: Camino Portugués is a comprehensive, incredibly handy mobile app for anyone walking all or part of the Portugués route of the Camino de Santiago.\n\nTrekRight includes an in-depth reference 'Trekopedia' (communities, albergues / hotels, attractions, services, points of interest, etc.), supports customizable routes, interactive maps (including detailed offline maps), directions and section-by-section guide, dynamic trip stats for your current section, stage, and route, an intelligent compass that shows the right direction based on your current location and chosen route, and more.\n\nThis app includes:\n- Detailed coverage of the Portugués from Porto northward, including the Central route plus growing coverage of the Coastal and Senda Litoral routes. \n- In-depth coverage is available for the popular Variante Espiritual option as well as some other alternatives. \n- Limited coverage is available for the Lisbon to Porto route, currently including the route itself, most albergues, and geo-located communities. \n- Offline maps (including with this purchase) for Porto to Santiago, including Central, Coastal, and Senda Litoral variants.\n- Offline maps are also available via in-app purchase for Lisbon to Porto. \n\nLet us know if you are interested in other Portugués variants and we'll try to add them as well.  \n\n# The Right Information, When You Need it\nLocation-aware information – TrekRight provides you with information tailored to your current location. If you are approaching a community, TrekRight will tell you how far you still have to go, what points of interest are available around you, where you can find a restaurant, and so on. Real-time information that keeps you completely on top of things!\n\n# Trekopedia\nTrekRight’s ‘Camino Encyclopedia’ is packed with extensive interactive reference information. Everything can be searched and filtered, viewed on a map, notes can be added (anything from a simple reservation number to a copy-and-pasted blurb from a website), and more. Handy information (literally) at your fingertips!\n\n# Interactive Map / Offline Maps\nPowerful, flexible maps built on top of our high-quality mapping engine, with full support for detailed offline map imagery. Displays your current location on your selected route along with pins showing all the locations included in the Trekopedia (just touch a pin to open its related Trekopedia entry). Our offline maps mean you don’t require Internet access to use the mapping functionality. Online maps are also available for when you have an Internet connection. Easily filter and do searches. Completely transform how you ‘see’ your surroundings on the trail.\n\n# Intelligent Compass\nIn addition to all the standard compass functionality, TrekRight’s intelligent compass also points you in the right direction based on your current location and your selected route, and updates dynamically as you move. Never get lost again!\n\n# Pre-Departure Planning & Preparation\nTrekRight makes it easy to plan your route (including configuring the sections you want to follow), organize it into stages, and review distances and elevations (including a handy interactive Elevation Profile Chart). Comes pre-defined with popular routes (full and partial). Review and rank albergues / hotels, flag locations of interest as ‘favourites’, add your own notes, and more. Be prepared!\n\n# Up-To-Date Content\nTrekRight’s content is regularly being updated and expanded based on the latest information available to us. You can check for content updates directly inside TrekRight and download our database whenever it is convenient for you (even on the trail), without having to connect to the App Store. Always be up to date!\n\n--- No Internet Connection Required ---\nAll of TrekRight's content is stored directly on your phone, including our detailed offline maps. Once the offline maps are downloaded, no Internet connection is required."

It's built by local Western Australians who have walked the Track several times and live only a few km from the Track. We know the area!\r\n\r\nThe guide works 100% without needing mobile phone reception or Internet access. The offline maps are very detailed, show the Cape to Cape Track, show where you are via GPS, and are marked up with camping areas, sightseeing, water sources, places to swim, some accommodation, restaurants and food shops, the best beachs, sights and many other points of interest. The App shows you how many kilometres you are from places like camping area and towns, and has an interactive elevation graph so you can see what hills are between you and places. \r\n\r\nThe App has advice on how to prepare for your trip, what gear to bring, when to walk, possible itineraries and suitable food. It has many other features, photos and information, as described below.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n- Very detailed offline maps. They ALWAYS work, even when mobile phone coverage and Internet are not available.\r\n- The map is tuned to look great on a small phone screen and show details that a walker in the bush needs. You'll see details such as minor tracks at map zoom levels where most other maps hide them. So zoom out and tracks don't disappear from your map! Great for your safety and easier for you to navigate even with a tiny screen.\r\n- Contour lines are shown on the map as you zoom in a little.\r\n- Uses GPS to show your location.\r\n- The map has extra markers for towns, camping areas, sights, places where you can get food, attractions, swimming spots and other points of interest.\r\n- Map markers also show you where to get water and the location of toilets.\r\n- Tap place markers on the map and be shown your distance from them along the track. See how far away that camping area is!\r\n- An elevation graph that you can zoom-and-swipe to see all the hills and valleys along the track. \r\n- The elevation graph shows your location and has markers for towns, camping and other places. Use it to see if you have to walk up any big hills to get to that next camping area?\r\n- Tap town, sightseeing, camping and other markers on the map to get detailed information and photographs for those places.\r\n- Has descriptions and pictures of each section of the Track.\r\n- Provides information on paid accommodation options. For those who want a bit more luxury than camping!\r\n- Has a track overview, and information about camping, drinking water, safety, weather, animals and history of the Cape to Cape Track.\r\n- Detailed advice and information on how to prepare for a multi-day trip, when to do your trip, what gear you need and suitable food.\r\n- Describes transportation options such as buses and companies that provide shuttle services.\r\n- No mobile phone coverage or internet is needed for the App to work. Put your phone in Airplane Mode to save battery power and continue to use the App (your phone's GPS will still work in Airplane Mode).\r\n- The App turns off GPS when the screen is turned off, so will not use phone power when you are not using it.\r\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Track to inspire you!\r\n\r\nYou should never get lost because the maps always work and show you where you are, even when you stray from the Track. The great detail on the maps make it easy to follow bush tracks and paths to get back to the track.\r\n\r\nThis App was built by a small Western Australian software company located only 8 km from the northern termination of the Track. We know the track and the area intimately. We're confident our Cape to Cape Track Guide App will make your trip easier to plan, safer and more fun."

For nearly 2000 years the Forest was also exploited for the iron industry, leading to the creation of the heathland landscape that covers two thirds of the area.

Enter your flight details, and using real flight data, the app perfectly demonstrates the unlikelihood of your flight going down.\n\nHow safe is your next flight? \n\nCrashes may make the headlines, but they’re incredibly rare, and when they do happen, seldom lead to injury. With those facts, there’s no need for nervous flyers to fall back on anything but the statistics. Am I Going Down? will tell you how and why you have only a millions-to-one chance of crashing, allowing you to fight fear with information.  \n\nNew York Times\n“In most cases a normal flight will give you a one in five million, or one in 10 million, chance of crashing, so that tends to reassure most people.”\n\nThe Economist\n\"[The app] wants to reassure nervous flyers that they are all but guaranteed to reach their destination in one piece.\"\n\nDaily Mail\n\"'Am I Going Down?' app uses real flight statistics to analyse flight safety.\"\n\nBustle\n\"One of the only sources providing such in-depth coverage of safety statistics in the aviation world.\"\n\nAlso featured in: CNN, Washington Post, Daily Telegraph, Quartz, Forbes, Newsweek, Gizmodo, Business Insider, Gadget Show, and many more! \n\n—\nDisclaimer: While \"Am I Going Down?\" is based on published flight and crash statistics to give an indication of flight safety, the app is intended for entertainment purposes only. The odds presented are an estimate of historical risk and not a prediction of future performance. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact info@vanillapixel.com or follow @fearofflyingapp on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram."

Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button.

With lots of useful features some of which are not available on the web …\n\n• Where available get the REAL arrival time of the busses, not timetabled times, but the actual time the bus is due at your chosen stop via the GPS tracker on the bus.\n• Check future arrival times by using the +1hr/-1hr buttons to move an hour or more along the schedules. \n• Store a list of \"Favourite Stops\" and organise them in Alphabetical order or simply order / rename them as you like.\n• Busses with a Live Feed will have their times highlighted in green and show how many minutes until they are due.\n• Busses with a Low Floor access for pushchairs and prams are indicated by a blue wheelchair icon on the end of the result.\n• You can tap on results to be alerted at your specified number of minutes before the bus is due, so you know when to set off.\n• Set an Auto-Refresh time to regularly reload the timetable data (Double Tap at the top of the timetable to enable).\n• The app will offer to fall back to SMS if you don't have a Data Connection on your phone.\n• Optional Shake to refresh and pull down on the results to refresh times.\n• Search for Busses / Stops by Postcode, Bus Number, or search for other bus stops near your current stop.\n• Use your phone's GPS to show a map of all the bus stops around you. \n• Our app uses the \"text-only\" version of the YourNextBus page and doesn't download images etc, this makes its very quick and saves on your data usage.\n• Large Text view for Sight Impaired users of iPads (enabled in the settings).\n\nIMPORTANT - Before purchasing we suggest you use the West Yorkshire Public Transport site linked above to make sure you can see information on the busses and stops you require. We can only provide the same information, so if you cannot find relevant information on their websites, our app will not be able to magically provide it. \n\nWe have thoroughly tested in Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield, Harrogate, Doncaster, Scarborough and York but please ensure your area is covered before purchase.\n\nPlease don't shoot the messenger by leaving negative reviews regarding the actual Bus Times data we display, this is from the WYPTE website and we can only show the data they offer. If the times are wrong, or the bus doesn’t turn up, then the problem is with their data or services and not our wonderful app! :)\n\n\nIf you have any suggestions or in the unlikely event of a problem please contact us via the Icons on the Service Status tab (Email, Twitter, Facebook, WWW). We cannot reply to comments left in the ratings on here, but we can assure you that you will receive a swift personal reply to any comments you send us via the Application.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimetable information provided by West Yorkshire Public Transport Executive (WYPTE).\nNote: Neither this application or its author is associated with or endorsed by WYPTE."

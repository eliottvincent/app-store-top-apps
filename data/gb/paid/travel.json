This NEW improved, paid version will help create more technology projects for the people of Chepstow and the surrounding areas.\nMore features are on their way for Enviroute, and we'll be adding surrounding roads / routes such as the M49 along with routes into Bristol, the M5, and more.\nIf you don't know about the original problems commuters have experienced with the Severn crossings, read on for some background...\nThe Severn bridges based between England and wales are major connections for the M4 and M48 motorways. Traditionally both crossings / bridges have been owned and operated by private companies.\n\n“Is the bridge open” and Enviroute have created an app that allows local residents and commuters to check the status of both bridges in order to plan their routes more effectively. From time to time the bridges are closed due to maintenance and/or adverse weather conditions and, since the ownership of the Severn bridges has changed there has been a lack of reliable communications around the status of the M48 Severn bridge and the M4 Severn Bridge.\n\n“Is the bridge open” is here to help with this and to provide information on when either of the Severn Bridges are closed or partially closed.\nSevern bridge updates at the touch of a button instead of endless maps, websites or twitter accounts. \nFind out instantly is the Severn Bridge is open and get updates sent directly to your device (Enviroute NEW now has this feature!) before you set off on your journey.\nBy paying for Enviroute NEW you are indirectly funding this local area for more exciting tech based projects.  We want to make life easier for residents of the surrounding areas, help local businesses sell more, save your local high-streets plus many more projects in the pipeline.  These will be funded by the money earned by Enviroute NEW\nThank you and I hope you enjoy the new version."

It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button. You can swipe through all your favorites on the main calculation interface just as you swipe the pages on the iPhone’s home screen.\n\n== Charts and Historic Rates==\neCurrency provides detailed historical charts for all exchange rates.

The application obtains its exchange rates from our self-developed Currency-Provider-engine that aggregates rates data from multiple sources to secure the reliability of exchange rate updates.\n\n== Tutorial & Support==\nOn the first startup a short self-running demo is displayed to introduce you to the app. We appreciate any reviews or comments you may have on eCurrency in iTunes. If you have any questions please contact us directly, as we are unable to respond to your enquiries via iTunes."

Containing all the content from the the best-selling travel book \"Wild Swimming\" by Daniel Start (Wild Things Publishing £16.99, second edition, 2013) this app provides all you need to visit hundreds of magical rivers, lakes and waterfalls across the UK. \n\nIn this great British tour you’ll be able to swim with otters in Devon, go river-tubing in Yorkshire, night-swim under the stars in Oxfordshire and learn how to build a woodland sauna. In each area you can ready background chapters on famous wild-swimmers of the past and read stories of heroes, lovers and ordinary folk who have long enjoyed bathing under the willows. Perfect whether you are a wild swimmer, family paddler or just enjoy a waterside picnic.\n\nNOTE: due to the large number of images and places the app is slow to load first time and may not work well (or crash) if many other apps are open in parallel. Please close other apps.\n\nYou will find preloaded maps, photos, directions and travel writing to inspire and inform. Most locations comes with stunning photography and some include detailed mapping (at 1:25,000 to help walkers and 1:250,000 to help with route-planning). There is contact information for nearby pubs, campsites and attractions. If you need inspiration you can browse the app by slideshow, list, photo gallery and on an interactive map. Ask the app to find places close to you, or search using postcode, address, star rating, walk-in time, keywords or other features. You can share places on email and Facebook and save favourites too."

Ideal for almost anything that requires measuring outdoor distance traveled such as walking, running, driving, boating, or hiking.  Note that GPS does not work well under a roof.  For best results, use outdoors.\n\nBenefits of the paid version:\n- Landscape and splitscreen support.\n- Ability to have multiple trips.  Each trip can be stopped and started independently.\n- Receive notifications while the application is closed at distance intervals of your choosing.\n- Custom units readout.  For example, you want to know how many calories you have burned.  You can customize this to include anything that has a linear relationship with distance traveled.  This can be different for each trip.\n- No advertisements.\n- Export trips via email and optionally restore later.\n\nDisplays:\n- Distance\n- Time elapsed\n- Speed (average or current)\n- Displacement (straight line distance from your starting point) This can be hidden.\n\nDistance units include:\n- Kilometers\n- Miles\n- Nautical miles\n- Meters\n- Feet\n\nSpeed units include:\n- Kilometers per hour\n- Miles per hour\n- Nautical miles per hour\n- Meters per second\n- Feet per second\n\nOther features:\n- Large font adjustable display.\n- Accurate to within 1 percent when compared to most car odometers under normal driving conditions.\n- Includes a lock to help prevent accidental reset of your trip. After unlocked, it locks back in a few seconds, or you can lock it yourself.\n- Approximates distance traveled in some GPS dead spots such as driving through a tunnel by adding the as-a-bird flies distance to your trip.\n\nPlease also note:\n- GPS Odometer does run in the background if you leave it running.  Be sure to pause the trip when you are finished or battery life will be negatively affected.  The timer stops when the trip is paused.\n- To change the display, tap the unlock button and notice the three green boxes that temporarily appear. Each button adjusts a different part of the display.\n- You can change the language to English in the application settings.\n\nPlease visit the web page for more details."

      "label": "Pasinaudoję šia programėle Jūs sužinosite daugybę naujų ir įkvepiančių istorijų apie Lietuvos Didžiąją kunigaikštystę, Trakų miestą su pilimis, kuriose įsikūręs Trakų istorijos muziejus! Išradingas ir sumanus gidas Jus lydės visos kelionės laiku metu, nuspės klausimus, suteikdamas žinių bei dar labiau pažadins smalsumą, kviesdamas apsilankyti dar kartą.\r\nGal nustebsite sužinoję, kad viduramžiais su Trakų vardu buvo siejamos trys pilys? Visos buvo mūrinės, visos apsuptos vandens – natūralių telkinių ir dirbtinai suformuotų perkasų. Dabar jas vadiname Senųjų Trakų, Trakų Pusiasalio ir Trakų Salos pilimis.\r\nPažintis prasideda trečiojoje, garsiausioje ir geriausiai išlikusioje – gotikinėje Salos pilyje. Pilies sala suformuota dirbtinai – sujungus tris atskiras, atskirtas durpyno, užpelkėjusio ežero ir pakrančių vandens, saleles. Konvento tipo kunigaikščių rūmai su aukščiausiu – 33 metrų aukščio – bokštu (vadinamu donžonu) ir gynybinėmis atraminėmis sienomis, suformuojant terasą, yra dviejų aukštų, su pusrūsiais ir gynybine pastoge. Gyvenamuosius aukštus juosia medinės galerijos. Iš jų durys veda į devynias menes, kuriose gyveno kunigaikščio šeima, svita ir svečiai, ir į visą aukštą užimančią didžiąją, arba reprezentacinę, menę. Pusrūsyje po ja buvo įrengta virtuvė, priešingoje pusėje, kitame korpuso pusrūsyje, – iždinė. Iš kiemelio matomos pusrūsiuose esančios orinio šildymo pakuros, ant originalaus tinko pilyje visur randama polichrominės tapybos likučių.\r\nTrakų istorijos muziejaus ekspozicija prasideda kairiajame sparne, vadinamosiose „Vytautinėse“ menėse, kuriose, manoma, apsistodavęs Didysis kunigaikštis su žmona. Vitrinose eksponuojami archeologiniai radiniai – šachmatų figūrėlės, Venecijos stiklo šukės, daugiaspalvės glazūros kokliai – byloja, kad XV amžiuje pilis buvo puošniai ir prabangiai įrengta, joje vykdavo įvairios pramogos, šventės, įšventinimai į riterius. Arbaletų strėlių antgaliai – dažnas archeologų radinys – byloja apie intensyvias kovas. Dar daugiau įvairios istorinės ginkluotės pavyzdžių galima apžiūrėti ekspozicijos vitrinose, klausantis nuodugnaus ir informatyvaus šios programėlės pasakojimo. Visą dešiniojo sparno pirmą aukštą užimanti didžioji, arba reprezentacinė, menė – svarbiausia ir puošniausia pilies patalpa. Tai, kad Lietuvos Didžioji Kunigaikštystė XV ir XVI amžiais buvo didžiausia savo plotu Europos valstybė, įrodoma senovės kartografų sukurtais žemėlapiais, o Trakų miesto ir  pilių grožis – pavaizduotas istorinėse graviūrose ir paveiksluose. Trumpai pristatoma XX amžiaus Salos pilies restauravimo istorija: vitražai, kaip ir kai kurie kiti architektūriniai sprendimai (grindų plytelių, medinių galerijų raštai), atkuriant buvo stilizuoti pagal ankstyvosios gotikos analogus.\r\nModernėjantis Trakų istorijos muziejus kiekvienais metais skiria daug dėmesio interaktyvioms pramogoms, įvairaus pobūdžio edukacijoms, nuolat surengia įdomių parodų, renginių ar atnaujina ilgalaikes ekspozicijas. Mūsų tikslas – įdomus, gyvas, nuolat besikeičiantis muziejus.\r\nKviečiame apsilankyti dar ne kartą. Tapkime gerais draugais!"

      "label": "This comprehensive guide shows you all you need to know to hike the Cape to Cape Track, which runs from Cape Naturaliste to Cape Leeuwin in the Margaret River Region of Western Australia.\n\nThis App has many innovative features that make it way more useful than a paper guidebook or a website!\n\nThe Cape to Cape Track is one of the best kept secrets in the world. If you have a chance to walk the Track, you will not be disappointed!\n\nThe App has beautiful photographs, extremely detailed information, built-in maps and GPS support. So you cannot get lost and will not miss anything.\n\nNO INTERNET OR MOBILE COVERAGE IS NEEDED to use this guide. This is very important because most of the track has no internet or mobile coverage. The excellent maps work without using any data, WiFi connection, or internet. So it's fast and won't cost you money. \n\nIt's very interactive; turn on your phone or tablet's GPS from within the App, then follow the track and you will never get lost again! Also see exactly where to park to take shorter day hikes, where to get water and food, and where the best sights, beaches and attractions are. Note that GPS works everywhere - you don't need mobile network reception for it to work.\n\nEach map is marked up to show you viewpoints, attractions, toilets, places to get water, the best beaches, where to camp and more. Tap any map marker to show much more information about that place.\n\nIt's like having your own personal tour guide in your pocket that is showing you exactly where to turn at those unmarked crossroads, and it can be quickly referenced to show you the name of the beach or town you are on or in. It is easier than using a paper guide book or a paper map and compass because you can instantly see where you are.\n\nWe suggest which way you should walk the track and give you the distances between campsites or paid (comfy!) accommodation to help you in planning your hike. \n\nFEATURES:\n- We describe beaches, sights, camping, accommodation and more\n- We give you lots of useful General Information to help you make your hike enjoyable and safe\n- We include a number of useful first-aid tips for the most common issues you may encounter on the Track\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Track to inspire you!\n- It has detailed maps of hiking trails. With the phone's GPS enabled you cannot get lost!\n- It works without the internet. So there are no data roaming charges. And mobile black spots will not stop the App from working (unlike websites and most other Apps)\n- It uses very high-resolution maps\n- It describes several other hiking tracks and day walks nearby the Cape to Cape track.\n- All information has been researched and written by a local of the Margaret River region\n- Information is presented relative to your current location, so its very easy to find where you are and how far it is to your next camping area or town for that cold beer or chilled glass of white wine\n- Has a useful search feature. For example, search for \"shower\" to list everything in the App that uses that text\n- Quick reference entries show you all of the water sources and the locations of toilets along the track. Activate the GPS to show you how far to your next one\n- The guide is simple to use\n- This App automatically keeps it's content up to date by periodically downloading updates from \"the cloud\". You don't have to do anything to make this happen."

      "label": "Ship's Bell is primarily an acoustic clock that sounds half-hourly or hourly time signals. Without taking the phone out of your pocket you can easily keep track of time.\n\nThe principle of this bell was founded in traditional seafaring. Seafarers used the bell to keep track of their four-hourly duty watches. The first half hour is signaled by a single bell strike. Another bell strike is added every half hour, ending with eight bell strikes. To hear the bell strikes better, they are grouped into double chimes. Eight bell strikes signaled a watch change – at midnight, 4 am, 8 am, 12 pm, 4 pm and 8 pm. With just eight different signals, being repeated in six cycles during the day, you will know what time it is every half and full hour.\n\n• Ship's bell according to the seafaring tradition\n• Two different kinds of chimes: classic bell or a modern synthesized sound\n• Option to strike only once each hour\n• Two different chimes for hourly signals: a single beep or a triple signal counting down to the full hour\n• Displays the current time on a maritime 24-hour clock face\n• Shows Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)\n• Switch to quickly enable or disable the acoustic signals\n\nA new addition in version 3.0 is the Tide Clock.\nAn additional clock hand and a tide ring can now be activated on the two dials of the glass clock (12-hour or 24-hour dial). This makes it possible to estimate the time until the next high or low tide in the style of a mechanical tide clock. The tide clock hand makes one revolution within 12 hours and 25 minutes independently of the hour clock hand and thus shows the average time between two high or low tides. The indices on the tide ring show the hours before and after a coming or past high or low tide.\n\nDear customers,\nIf there are any issues with this app, please send an email to our support team. We will get back to you as soon as possible!"

See with a glance whether or not your train is running on time.\n- Simple train adding UI: Tell us where you're going using our simple UI and we'll do the rest.\n- Missed trains: Missed a train? Don't worry, we'll detect that too and offer you help on advice on what to do to reach your destination as soon as possible.\n\nPlease note that this app does not support London underground services, only UK mainline services."

There are a couple of way to do this if you are in Yorkshire, but none are specifically aimed at the iPhone.\n\n1.Text the 8 digit bus stop number to 63876 (A text message is charged at your standard outbound rate plus a maximum of 12p for the returned text.) \n\n2.Use the \"YourNextBus Service\" at  http://www.wymetro.com/yournextbus/search/ in Mobile Safari (What a hassle to navigate and remember all your stop numbers)\n\nNow you can have a dedicated app which will store your favourite Bus Stop numbers and present the results in an iPhone / iPad friendly format. With lots of useful features some of which are not available on the web …\n\n• Where available get the REAL arrival time of the busses, not timetabled times, but the actual time the bus is due at your chosen stop via the GPS tracker on the bus.\n• Check future arrival times by using the +1hr/-1hr buttons to move an hour or more along the schedules. \n• Store a list of \"Favourite Stops\" and organise them in Alphabetical order or simply order / rename them as you like.\n• Busses with a Live Feed will have their times highlighted in green and show how many minutes until they are due.\n• Busses with a Low Floor access for pushchairs and prams are indicated by a blue wheelchair icon on the end of the result.\n• You can tap on results to be alerted at your specified number of minutes before the bus is due, so you know when to set off.\n• Set an Auto-Refresh time to regularly reload the timetable data (Double Tap at the top of the timetable to enable).\n• The app will offer to fall back to SMS if you don't have a Data Connection on your phone.\n• Optional Shake to refresh and pull down on the results to refresh times.\n• Search for Busses / Stops by Postcode, Bus Number, or search for other bus stops near your current stop.\n• Use your phone's GPS to show a map of all the bus stops around you. \n• Our app uses the \"text-only\" version of the YourNextBus page and doesn't download images etc, this makes its very quick and saves on your data usage.\n• Large Text view for Sight Impaired users of iPads (enabled in the settings).\n\nIMPORTANT - Before purchasing we suggest you use the West Yorkshire Public Transport site linked above to make sure you can see information on the busses and stops you require. We can only provide the same information, so if you cannot find relevant information on their websites, our app will not be able to magically provide it. \n\nWe have thoroughly tested in Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield, Harrogate, Doncaster, Scarborough and York but please ensure your area is covered before purchase.\n\nPlease don't shoot the messenger by leaving negative reviews regarding the actual Bus Times data we display, this is from the WYPTE website and we can only show the data they offer. If the times are wrong, or the bus doesn’t turn up, then the problem is with their data or services and not our wonderful app! :)\n\n\nIf you have any suggestions or in the unlikely event of a problem please contact us via the Icons on the Service Status tab (Email, Twitter, Facebook, WWW). We cannot reply to comments left in the ratings on here, but we can assure you that you will receive a swift personal reply to any comments you send us via the Application.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimetable information provided by West Yorkshire Public Transport Executive (WYPTE).\nNote: Neither this application or its author is associated with or endorsed by WYPTE."

      "label": "Welcome to KrugerExplorer – the all-in-one encyclopedia to Kruger National Park.\n\nWhether you are planning your South African safari, need the perfect companion guide for your self-drive Kruger experience, or simply want to explore Kruger from the comfort of home, you will find everything you need in the KrugerExplorer App.\n\nThis App explores the Greater Kruger in unparalleled detail, and includes:\n- The most extensive Kruger wildlife Field Guide ever created.\n- Guided Routes that share our knowledge of the park’s roads from years of exploring Kruger.\n- The most up-to-date Kruger Maps available, helping you navigate the park’s 3,500km road network including several newly opened roads.\n- Live GPS map with downloadable offline maps so you always know your location.\n- Extensive sections on Kruger’s Rest Camps, Itineraries, Accommodation, plus exclusive Special Offers & Competitions.\n- Thousands of stunning photographic images and audio files to reveal all the beauty of Kruger’s wildlife.\n- And once downloaded, the App works 100% offline – perfect for exploring the Kruger!\n\nThe Field Guide section is unprecedented in its focus on Kruger’s wildlife. It includes over 700 species profiles detailing physical characteristics, behaviours and locations, and each is accompanied by breathtaking photography to aid identification. The 700+ species profiles cover:\n- All 148 mammal species ever recorded in Kruger, including the best places to find them.\n- Over 60 footprint graphics so you can identify wildlife spoor.\n- 500+ bird species, including all of Kruger’s resident, migrant visitor and vagrant records since 2010. Stunning bird photography includes male, female, juvenile and breeding plumage where relevant.\n- Over 500 bird audio files bring the sounds of the bush to life.\n- 60+ profiles of commonly encountered reptiles and invertebrates, including crocodiles, snakes, lizards, tortoises, butterflies, spiders & much more.\n\nThe Guided Routes use our experience from many years exploring Kruger to create 70+ incredible journeys through the park:\n- The routes are like having an in-person guide in your pocket. Each includes extensive commentary that doesn’t just say, “Take that road because it’s good for lions,” but instead explains the geology of each area, which in turn informs the flora that grows there, the herbivores that eat that flora and, ultimately, the predators that hunt those herbivores.\n- Each route will help you develop an intimate insight into Kruger’s incredible wilderness.\n- Each of the rest camps and entrance gates is covered with short, medium and full-day routes to explore.\n\nThe Maps are the most detailed and up-to-date available:\n- They include newly opened roads and correct errors found in the maps available in the park shops. \n- For first-time visitors to Kruger, note that you are not provided with a map and must buy one from a park shop at a cost similar to this App.\n- The live GPS map means you'll never get lost.\n\nWith over half a million words of content, KrugerExplorer is the most comprehensive and unparalleled encyclopedia for the Greater Kruger ever created.\n\nSince launching in 2019, the App has had a superb reception from fans and received wonderful accolades:\n- Downloads in over 80 countries\n- App Store “App of the Day”\n- “Recommended” commendation by BirdLife South Africa\n- “Highly Recommended” by Getaway Magazine\n\nKrugerExplorer is also a global community of wildlife lovers. You can enjoy the stories, photos and experiences of our 200,000+ followers on Facebook & Instagram. We look forward to seeing you there!\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n- Yes, the App works 100% offline once fully downloaded. You can put your device into flight mode, escape to the bush and still make full use of the App!\n- Yes, this App is a one-time purchase, with no further in-app purchases or ongoing subscriptions required.\n- This is an English language app.\n\nHappy exploring,\nDanny & Charlotte"

Point your phone in the approximate direction that the track is running and see the estimated, interpolated position and distance of trains from your nearest station as beacons overlaid on-screen in AR (augmented reality).\n\nFind Great Britain real-time train times almost instantly from your nearest stations. Displays platform information where available. Automatically loads train times from your nearest station or loads train times from a station that you select from the stations screen. Filter train times by destination station to quickly find the timetable and live real-time train time information that you’re looking for.\n\nFuturistic high tech features\n\nWidgets - requires iOS 14 or higher\n\nEasily see train times, cancellations, rail incidents and service status on your homescreen.\n\nIncidents\n\nEasily see information about the service status and news about rail incidents and current / future planned maintenance. The incidents screen includes information such as the incident details, routes affected, date/s of incident and direct links to the relevent National Rail Enquiries page and map, where available.\n\nAR (augmented reality) mode - requires iOS 13 or higher\n\nPicture real-time train information in an interactive real-world environment. See nearby trains and railway stations in an immersive augmented reality experience. The app will locate trains that are departing from your nearest station and display them. Tapping on a train reveals more information about its calling points and last reported location. AR mode is available on iOS 13 or higher.\n\nTrain Tracker\n\nUsing it’s advanced geo-location capabilities, combined with real-time train data and it’s UK rail network map, the app predicts the estimated, interpolated location of trains at any given time. The estimated train location is displayed on a map, with information about whether the service is currently running early, on-time or late.\n\nHigh precision information\n\nThe app can report times from intermediary passing points such as junctions, providing you with a high level of precision and accuracy about the current status of a given train’s journey. Packed with detailed train information like number of carriages, train category, power type (eg Electric Multiple Unit), timing load (eg Class 323), planned maximum speed (eg 90mph max), seating classes, reservations, catering, and operating characteristics (eg Driver Only Operation). Please note that this information is only available if this data has been supplied by the Train Operating Company. Some TOCs do not supply carriage data.\n\nCustomer Feedback\n\n\"Thanks to the JUST bought @TrainBeacon app, light bags and running legs trained with @LondonCityAC - just swapped trains at READING, with 2 minutes crossover time. All makes for a GREAT #SundayMorning! #Staycation adventure to #Cornwall” - James Moyse - Journalist at Sky News\n\n\"@TrainBeacon who’s behind this app?? You’ve satisfied my nerdy needs and I am so impressed as to how slick it is. Well done”\n\n\"love the AR mode\"\n\nSafety Information\n\nNot for use in safety critical applications, level crossings, etc. Train position is estimated from latest available timing point data and may be incorrect. Care must be taken during use. Other trains may be present that are not indicated in the AR or train tracker mode of the app such as trains not stopping at the nearest station and also freight trains. Freight and non passenger trains are not displayed in the app. For your safety do not use your phone while you walk and take extreme care using the app near trains and railways.\n\nHardware requirements\n\n* AR mode and the augmented reality features of the app require iOS 13 or higher, and an iPhone 6S, SE or later device, or an iPad 2017 or later. Widgets require iOS 14 or higher *\n\nApp powered by National Rail Enquiries and contains information of Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd"

Don’t just come for the day, come for the stay and explore more of this spectacular area and its scenery.  \n\n\r\nThis GPS enabled app provides reassurance as you follow the arrow along your chosen route. It will also show you how far you are around the route. \n\n\r\nThis app has been developed alongside our National Park Yorkshire Three Peaks Rangers who have added points of interest along the routes for you. \n\n\r\nThe app also includes important safety advice and the code of conduct, which will help  you stay safe on the walks and help protect our  local communities. \n\n\r\nThe app is not a mapping tool. You must take other forms of navigation with you and know how to use them. We recommend you have an OS Explorer OL2 Yorkshire Dales (Southern and Western) map with you. \n\n\r\nUsing GPS tracking uses more of your battery than normal – do not rely solely on this app when walking.  \n\n\r\nAlways be prepared, conditions can change rapidly in an upland area such as the Three Peaks. \n\n\r\nYou must read the safety information contained in this app before using the route information.  \n  \r\nThe Yorkshire Three Peaks are very fragile environments, and the public rights of way network is under pressure from the hundreds of thousands of visitors that come to enjoy it each year. Maintaining the paths in the Yorkshire Three Peaks area costs on average £35 per metre. \n\n\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this app all go towards helping the Yorkshire Dales National Park with this work. \n\n\r\n\r\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\r\n\r\nContains OpenStreetMap Data © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\r\nhttps://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright \n\n\r\n\r\nThis walking app was developed for the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority by the team at Local Walks - www.localwalks.co.uk \n\n\r\n\r\nApp terms and conditions:\r\nhttps://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/apptermsandconditions"

Would you like to leave your house and arrive at your bus stop moments before your bus arrives? How many times did you get to your bus stop just to wave your bus goodbye as it passes you because you were a moment too late? We would all like to just hop onto a bus without waiting ages at a stop. Now we can.\n\nKey features:\n- Search by name: You can add bus stops by searching for them by name\n- Search by ID: You can also add bus stops by entering bus stop ID, each bus stop has its ID printed on a code plate placed above the timetable\n- Search by location: You can quickly add bus stops that are located near you at any time\n- Current location arrivals: You can check bus arrivals at the bus stop that's the closest to you at any time without knowing it's name\n\nDo you have any suggestions for improvements?

It has the first trains, the last trains and all the trains in between!\n\nJust choose your departure station and you’ll immediately see the last three trains of the day from that station. But it’s just as easy to check the first trains of the day, or the time of the next scheduled train. Choose a train and you’ll see all the stations it stops at and how long the journey will take. You can even check to see if you’ll have time to interchange with another line at one of the stops.\n\nTube Times does not need internet access, all the data is built-in, so it works fine underground or on an iPod touch. It contains data for all the Tube lines and the DLR, but does not currently include the London Overground.\n\nIMPORTANT: Tube Times does not display any live train time information. Its timetable is based on data published by Transport for London, and actual train times will be affected by line closures, engineering work and other delays, so check before you travel.\n\nPlease get in touch if you have any questions or feedback: support@tubetimesapp.com or @tubetimes on Twitter."

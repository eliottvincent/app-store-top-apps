All makes for a GREAT #SundayMorning! #Staycation adventure to #Cornwall” - James Moyse - Journalist at Sky News\n\n\"@TrainBeacon who’s behind this app?? You’ve satisfied my nerdy needs and I am so impressed as to how slick it is. Well done”\n\n\"love the AR mode\"\n\nSafety Information\n\nNot for use in safety critical applications, level crossings, etc. Train position is estimated from latest available timing point data and may be incorrect. Care must be taken during use. Other trains may be present that are not indicated in the AR or train tracker mode of the app such as trains not stopping at the nearest station and also freight trains. Freight and non passenger trains are not displayed in the app. For your safety do not use your phone while you walk and take extreme care using the app near trains and railways.\n\nHardware requirements\n\n* AR mode and the augmented reality features of the app require iOS 13 or higher, and an iPhone 6S, SE or later device, or an iPad 2017 or later. Widgets require iOS 14 or higher *\n\nApp powered by National Rail Enquiries and contains information of Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd"

Say goodbye to complicated train tracking and say hello to train tracking that gives you the information relevant to you.\n\nSimply book your trains as normal and then enter details about each of your journeys into Track. From that point onwards Track will keep an eye on all of your trains, let you know if you can make your connections, show you when you are delayed and give you help and advice when a train is cancelled.\n\nFeatures;\n\n- Connection information: We'll keep an eye out on your multiple leg journey and let you know how your chances of making your connection are looking.\n- Live train information: How long until your train arrives, whether or not it's approaching the station right now or even a countdown on how many minutes you have until the doors close and it leaves without you!\n- Colour coded statuses for your trains. See with a glance whether or not your train is running on time.\n- Simple train adding UI: Tell us where you're going using our simple UI and we'll do the rest.\n- Missed trains: Missed a train? Don't worry, we'll detect that too and offer you help on advice on what to do to reach your destination as soon as possible.\n\nPlease note that this app does not support London underground services, only UK mainline services."

      "label": "Love exploring Joshua Tree but hate that you can't get a cell signal in the park, making it nearly impossible to find the best sights? Well, today's your lucky day!\n\nIntroducing our new offline Joshua Tree National Park (and surrounding areas) photo guide. Now you can get all the great photos, content, and exact locations that you already love in Fotospot, but with one big difference - offline maps! When you have a working WiFi connection, simply download our offline guide to your device and, like magic, the app will now work when you don't have an internet connection. You'll be able to check in, save attractions for later, add new photos, and - best of all - find the exact locations of all the coolest Joshua Tree spots including Heart Rock, Lost Horse Mine, Barker Dam, and Skull Rock - all without having a working cell signal!\n\nPlease note, some of these attractions can be found in our flagship app, Fotospot, but with two huge differences:\n\n1. Exclusive Content \nSome of the coolest (and hardest to find) attractions can only be found here like the Iron Door Cave, Penguin Rock, Eagle Cliff Boulder House, Samuelson Rocks, the Freak Brothers, and Garrett's Arch (the largest arch in the park!), plus a ton more.\n\n2. Offline Maps\nUnlike Fotospot, our Joshua Tree photo guide works even when you don't have a working cell signal (and that's basically the entire park).\n\nOne-time payment:\nWe don't have any upsells, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in this app, so for a simple one-time purchase, all of this can be yours for life. Plus, you'll automatically get any new future attractions we add to the app for FREE!\n\nLeave no trace:\nWhen visiting any attraction (in our app or not) please be responsible and leave it exactly how you found it. Take only photos and leave only footprints. To learn more please visit LNT.org.\n\nHappy exploring,\nThe Fotospot Team\n\n#fotospotting\n#fotospotapp"

It has the first trains, the last trains and all the trains in between!\n\nJust choose your departure station and you’ll immediately see the last three trains of the day from that station. But it’s just as easy to check the first trains of the day, or the time of the next scheduled train. Choose a train and you’ll see all the stations it stops at and how long the journey will take. You can even check to see if you’ll have time to interchange with another line at one of the stops.\n\nTube Times does not need internet access, all the data is built-in, so it works fine underground or on an iPod touch. It contains data for all the Tube lines and the DLR, but does not currently include the London Overground.\n\nIMPORTANT: Tube Times does not display any live train time information. Its timetable is based on data published by Transport for London, and actual train times will be affected by line closures, engineering work and other delays, so check before you travel.\n\nPlease get in touch if you have any questions or feedback: support@tubetimesapp.com or @tubetimes on Twitter."

      "label": "The key feature of this app is the use of a simple pointer to find your way; no mobile data used; no maps required. This is especially useful in remote locations where accessing maps can be challenging or when travelling overseas where mobile data costs can be prohibitive.\n\nWHAT DOES THE APP DO?\n• Save numerous locations to return to or visit later. \n• A simple pointer guides you where to go. Choose any route and the pointer continually updates the direction required to reach your goal location. \n• How far away? The distance to your destination is constantly updated as you progress.\n\nSTORE AND MANAGE AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF LOCATIONS\n• Store your current location to return to it later\n• Store any location anywhere in the world\n• Planning a trip? No problem. Store multiple places to visit in advance ready for your arrival.\n• Sort your locations into an order that makes most sense to you.\n\nFIND LOCATIONS USING GPS AND A SIMPLE POINTER, OR USING MAPS\n• Find your way using GPS and a simple pointer; uses no mobile data, maps not required.\n• See how far away from your chosen destination you are at any time.\n• If you’re connected, you can choose to use the Maps integration to navigate to your destination instead.\n\nSOME EXAMPLES OF WHEN AND WHERE YOU MIGHT USE THE APP\n• Parked your car in an unfamiliar city? Maybe you’ve parked in a long stay airport car park and gone on holiday? No worries, you’ll easily find your car when you want to go home.\n• Pitched your tent at a festival amongst 1000’s of others? You’ll find it again, anytime, no problem.\n• Want to find your way to a particular tourist attraction? Save the location using the built-in map and follow the pointer to find it.\n• Need to get back to your start point after a long walk in the countryside? That’s not an issue, and you can check how far away you are from your start point at any time.\n\nHOW TO GET THE BEST FROM THE APP\n• The app uses the built-in GPS chip in your device. This requires clear line of sight from your device to the sky to lock on to GPS signals broadcast from space to establish your position on Earth. If you stand between skyscrapers, sit inside a building or walk under dense foliage then this will likely impact the GPS chip in your device from establishing an accurate location. Try to find some clear sky and your device will soon find your location.\n• Avoid magnetic interference near your device as this can affect the built-in compass and give a false direction. Moving the device around away from interference can help it pick up the Earth’s magnetic field and determine which way is North. If the device determines it needs to recalibrate its compass then the standard compass calibration screen will be displayed.\n• Continuously using any app that uses GPS will drain the battery more quickly than normal. The app only uses GPS while it is active so one way to minimise battery usage is to use the app when you need to check the direction you need to travel to reach your destination.\n\nAND FINALLY…\n\nWe built this app to make navigating without maps as simple as possible.\n\nIf you have any feedback, ideas for new features or suggestions for improvement we’d love to hear from you. You can get in touch with us via options on the Settings screen of the app. \n\nAnd if you like the app and want to support us, please, give us a 5-star review, you’ll make us more than happy :)\n\nCreated by Redkoala Solutions Ltd\nwww.redkoalasolutions.com"

      "label": "The Three Peaks of Pen-y-ghent, Ingleborough and Whernside are among the best-known in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. Every year thousands come to reach the top of at least one or to conquer all three in one go. \n\n\r\nThe app contains route details for the classic 24-mile circular walk, route maps for the individual peaks, Whernside, Pen-y-ghent and Ingleborough and four other shorter walks in the Three Peaks area. Don’t just come for the day, come for the stay and explore more of this spectacular area and its scenery.  \n\n\r\nThis GPS enabled app provides reassurance as you follow the arrow along your chosen route. It will also show you how far you are around the route. \n\n\r\nThis app has been developed alongside our National Park Yorkshire Three Peaks Rangers who have added points of interest along the routes for you. \n\n\r\nThe app also includes important safety advice and the code of conduct, which will help  you stay safe on the walks and help protect our  local communities. \n\n\r\nThe app is not a mapping tool. You must take other forms of navigation with you and know how to use them. We recommend you have an OS Explorer OL2 Yorkshire Dales (Southern and Western) map with you. \n\n\r\nUsing GPS tracking uses more of your battery than normal – do not rely solely on this app when walking.  \n\n\r\nAlways be prepared, conditions can change rapidly in an upland area such as the Three Peaks. \n\n\r\nYou must read the safety information contained in this app before using the route information.  \n  \r\nThe Yorkshire Three Peaks are very fragile environments, and the public rights of way network is under pressure from the hundreds of thousands of visitors that come to enjoy it each year. Maintaining the paths in the Yorkshire Three Peaks area costs on average £35 per metre. \n\n\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of this app all go towards helping the Yorkshire Dales National Park with this work. \n\n\r\n\r\nContains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2020.\r\n\r\nContains OpenStreetMap Data © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\r\nhttps://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright \n\n\r\n\r\nThis walking app was developed for the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority by the team at Local Walks - www.localwalks.co.uk \n\n\r\n\r\nApp terms and conditions:\r\nhttps://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/apptermsandconditions"

Keep track of which Mickey’s you find with an easy to use built-in scoring system. Keep in mind – this is a scavenger hunt! The score counts if you want it to, so do your best and try to use the least amount of hints as possible.\n\nWhether you’re playing solo or with the whole family, you are able to keep separate user profiles to keep track of everyone’s progress. Spanning all four parks and documenting over 1200 Hidden Mickeys, this application will add a whole new level of entertainment to your trips to Disney World!\n\nIn this application you'll discover well over 1200 Hidden Mickeys throughout various locations at the Walt Disney World Resort including:\n• Magic Kingdom Park \n• Epcot\n• Disney's Hollywood Studios\n• Disney’s Animal Kingdom\n• Blizzard Beach & Typhoon Lagoon Water Parks\n• Disney Springs\n• EPSN Wide World of Sports\n• Miniature Golf Courses\n• Over 20 DIFFERENT Disney Hotels\n\nPLUS: tips, hints and author Steven Barrett's very own favorite Hidden Mickeys. We've also included the use of Game Center, which allows you gain achievements while playing! We've even hidden a few of these that can only unlock from certain places inside the park - can you get them all?\n\nTrue to their name, Hidden Mickeys are elusive. New ones appear from time to time and some old ones disappear. When that happens — and it will — Steve will let you know on his web site: www.HiddenMickeysGuide.com. Periodically, the application will be updated to reflect these changes, becoming your best source for all things Hidden Mickeys!\n\n“Hidden Mickeys” is based off of the newest and most comprehensive edition of the book. “Hidden Mickeys – A Field Guide to Walt Disney World's Best Kept Secrets” 8th edition can be found for sale throughout Disney World, in stores, or online at Amazon.com."

Would you like to leave your house and arrive at your bus stop moments before your bus arrives? How many times did you get to your bus stop just to wave your bus goodbye as it passes you because you were a moment too late? We would all like to just hop onto a bus without waiting ages at a stop. Now we can.\n\nKey features:\n- Search by name: You can add bus stops by searching for them by name\n- Search by ID: You can also add bus stops by entering bus stop ID, each bus stop has its ID printed on a code plate placed above the timetable\n- Search by location: You can quickly add bus stops that are located near you at any time\n- Current location arrivals: You can check bus arrivals at the bus stop that's the closest to you at any time without knowing it's name\n\nDo you have any suggestions for improvements?

This NEW improved, paid version will help create more technology projects for the people of Chepstow and the surrounding areas.\nMore features are on their way for Enviroute, and we'll be adding surrounding roads / routes such as the M49 along with routes into Bristol, the M5, and more.\nIf you don't know about the original problems commuters have experienced with the Severn crossings, read on for some background...\nThe Severn bridges based between England and wales are major connections for the M4 and M48 motorways. Traditionally both crossings / bridges have been owned and operated by private companies.\n\n“Is the bridge open” and Enviroute have created an app that allows local residents and commuters to check the status of both bridges in order to plan their routes more effectively. From time to time the bridges are closed due to maintenance and/or adverse weather conditions and, since the ownership of the Severn bridges has changed there has been a lack of reliable communications around the status of the M48 Severn bridge and the M4 Severn Bridge.\n\n“Is the bridge open” is here to help with this and to provide information on when either of the Severn Bridges are closed or partially closed.\nSevern bridge updates at the touch of a button instead of endless maps, websites or twitter accounts. \nFind out instantly is the Severn Bridge is open and get updates sent directly to your device (Enviroute NEW now has this feature!) before you set off on your journey.\nBy paying for Enviroute NEW you are indirectly funding this local area for more exciting tech based projects.  We want to make life easier for residents of the surrounding areas, help local businesses sell more, save your local high-streets plus many more projects in the pipeline.  These will be funded by the money earned by Enviroute NEW\nThank you and I hope you enjoy the new version."

Each includes extensive commentary that doesn’t just say, “Take that road because it’s good for lions,” but instead explains the geology of each area, which in turn informs the flora that grows there, the herbivores that eat that flora and, ultimately, the predators that hunt those herbivores.\n- Each route will help you develop an intimate insight into Kruger’s incredible wilderness.\n- Each of the rest camps and entrance gates is covered with short, medium and full-day routes to explore.\n\nThe Maps are the most detailed and up-to-date available:\n- They include newly opened roads and correct errors found in the maps available in the park shops. \n- For first-time visitors to Kruger, note that you are not provided with a map and must buy one from a park shop at a cost similar to this App.\n- The live GPS map means you'll never get lost.\n\nWith over half a million words of content, KrugerExplorer is the most comprehensive and unparalleled encyclopedia for the Greater Kruger ever created.\n\nSince launching in 2019, the App has had a superb reception from fans and received wonderful accolades:\n- Downloads in over 80 countries\n- App Store “App of the Day”\n- “Recommended” commendation by BirdLife South Africa\n- “Highly Recommended” by Getaway Magazine\n\nKrugerExplorer is also a global community of wildlife lovers.

      "label": "No account necessary.  No hidden costs.  All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

It's built by local Western Australians who have walked the Track several times and live only a few km from the Track. We know the area!\r\n\r\nThe guide works 100% without needing mobile phone reception or Internet access. The offline maps are very detailed, show the Cape to Cape Track, show where you are via GPS, and are marked up with camping areas, sightseeing, water sources, places to swim, some accommodation, restaurants and food shops, the best beachs, sights and many other points of interest. The App shows you how many kilometres you are from places like camping area and towns, and has an interactive elevation graph so you can see what hills are between you and places. \r\n\r\nThe App has advice on how to prepare for your trip, what gear to bring, when to walk, possible itineraries and suitable food. It has many other features, photos and information, as described below.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n- Very detailed offline maps. They ALWAYS work, even when mobile phone coverage and Internet are not available.\r\n- The map is tuned to look great on a small phone screen and show details that a walker in the bush needs. You'll see details such as minor tracks at map zoom levels where most other maps hide them. So zoom out and tracks don't disappear from your map! Great for your safety and easier for you to navigate even with a tiny screen.\r\n- Contour lines are shown on the map as you zoom in a little.\r\n- Uses GPS to show your location.\r\n- The map has extra markers for towns, camping areas, sights, places where you can get food, attractions, swimming spots and other points of interest.\r\n- Map markers also show you where to get water and the location of toilets.\r\n- Tap place markers on the map and be shown your distance from them along the track. See how far away that camping area is!\r\n- An elevation graph that you can zoom-and-swipe to see all the hills and valleys along the track. \r\n- The elevation graph shows your location and has markers for towns, camping and other places. Use it to see if you have to walk up any big hills to get to that next camping area?\r\n- Tap town, sightseeing, camping and other markers on the map to get detailed information and photographs for those places.\r\n- Has descriptions and pictures of each section of the Track.\r\n- Provides information on paid accommodation options. For those who want a bit more luxury than camping!\r\n- Has a track overview, and information about camping, drinking water, safety, weather, animals and history of the Cape to Cape Track.\r\n- Detailed advice and information on how to prepare for a multi-day trip, when to do your trip, what gear you need and suitable food.\r\n- Describes transportation options such as buses and companies that provide shuttle services.\r\n- No mobile phone coverage or internet is needed for the App to work. Put your phone in Airplane Mode to save battery power and continue to use the App (your phone's GPS will still work in Airplane Mode).\r\n- The App turns off GPS when the screen is turned off, so will not use phone power when you are not using it.\r\n- The guide has loads of beautiful photographs of the Track to inspire you!\r\n\r\nYou should never get lost because the maps always work and show you where you are, even when you stray from the Track. The great detail on the maps make it easy to follow bush tracks and paths to get back to the track.\r\n\r\nThis App was built by a small Western Australian software company located only 8 km from the northern termination of the Track. We know the track and the area intimately. We're confident our Cape to Cape Track Guide App will make your trip easier to plan, safer and more fun."

It displays attractions, meet'n greets, shows, and parades on a single map with a simple color-coded system that breaks each item into good or bad use of your time, provides walking directions, and even suggests what to do right now.  Ask yourself a few questions.  Do you know if an attraction's current wait time is above or below average?  Would you know when a show or parade was about to start, right around the corner from where you are standing?  Do you know quickly when an attraction is closed or the exact minutes until a show begins?  Can you look at all the information about shows and rides and figure out what's the best use of your time right now?  Overwhelmed?  You don't have to be with Merlin's Magic Map by your side.  Simply open it on your smartphone and let it do all the work.\n  \nWhether you’re a thrill-seeker looking to ride all the best rides, or at the park to enjoy a day of shows and entertainment, or a little bit of both,  Merlin’s Magic Map will guide you through every turn making sure you never have to wait for the magic!\n\nKey Features:\n\n1. Simple Intuitive Design - A simple design reduces the complexities of each park down to three color-coded states, clearly spelling out your current attraction and entertainment options in one view.\n\n2. Real-Time Recommendation Engine - The true \"magic\" is the powerful suggestion engine which is calculated based on 15 separate criteria. Why wait for the magic? Allow the app to answer the question \"what should I do right now?\" and maximize every moment.\n\n3. Personalization - Quickly and easily adjust your favorite attractions and entertainment, or tell the recommendation engine to ignore others, making each user's experience customized specifically to them.\n\n4. Battery Friendly - You might not realize it, but the official Disney app is a real drain on your battery. Stop looking for an outlet and start enjoying your day at the park. Each app has been specifically designed from the ground up to be as battery-efficient as possible.\n\nIf you enjoyed Merlin's Magic Map of Disney World, please take a moment to add a nice review. Every review really helps, and thanks for your support!\n\nMerlin's Magic Map is in no way associated with Walt Disney World or Disney Parks & Travel."

Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button.

      "label": "Ever been stood at a Bus Stop wondering when the next bus is? Or sat at home / in the pub wondering if you need to set off yet? There are a couple of way to do this if you are in Yorkshire, but none are specifically aimed at the iPhone.\n\n1.Text the 8 digit bus stop number to 63876 (A text message is charged at your standard outbound rate plus a maximum of 12p for the returned text.) \n\n2.Use the \"YourNextBus Service\" at  http://www.wymetro.com/yournextbus/search/ in Mobile Safari (What a hassle to navigate and remember all your stop numbers)\n\nNow you can have a dedicated app which will store your favourite Bus Stop numbers and present the results in an iPhone / iPad friendly format. With lots of useful features some of which are not available on the web …\n\n• Where available get the REAL arrival time of the busses, not timetabled times, but the actual time the bus is due at your chosen stop via the GPS tracker on the bus.\n• Check future arrival times by using the +1hr/-1hr buttons to move an hour or more along the schedules. \n• Store a list of \"Favourite Stops\" and organise them in Alphabetical order or simply order / rename them as you like.\n• Busses with a Live Feed will have their times highlighted in green and show how many minutes until they are due.\n• Busses with a Low Floor access for pushchairs and prams are indicated by a blue wheelchair icon on the end of the result.\n• You can tap on results to be alerted at your specified number of minutes before the bus is due, so you know when to set off.\n• Set an Auto-Refresh time to regularly reload the timetable data (Double Tap at the top of the timetable to enable).\n• The app will offer to fall back to SMS if you don't have a Data Connection on your phone.\n• Optional Shake to refresh and pull down on the results to refresh times.\n• Search for Busses / Stops by Postcode, Bus Number, or search for other bus stops near your current stop.\n• Use your phone's GPS to show a map of all the bus stops around you. \n• Our app uses the \"text-only\" version of the YourNextBus page and doesn't download images etc, this makes its very quick and saves on your data usage.\n• Large Text view for Sight Impaired users of iPads (enabled in the settings).\n\nIMPORTANT - Before purchasing we suggest you use the West Yorkshire Public Transport site linked above to make sure you can see information on the busses and stops you require. We can only provide the same information, so if you cannot find relevant information on their websites, our app will not be able to magically provide it. \n\nWe have thoroughly tested in Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield, Harrogate, Doncaster, Scarborough and York but please ensure your area is covered before purchase.\n\nPlease don't shoot the messenger by leaving negative reviews regarding the actual Bus Times data we display, this is from the WYPTE website and we can only show the data they offer. If the times are wrong, or the bus doesn’t turn up, then the problem is with their data or services and not our wonderful app! :)\n\n\nIf you have any suggestions or in the unlikely event of a problem please contact us via the Icons on the Service Status tab (Email, Twitter, Facebook, WWW). We cannot reply to comments left in the ratings on here, but we can assure you that you will receive a swift personal reply to any comments you send us via the Application.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimetable information provided by West Yorkshire Public Transport Executive (WYPTE).\nNote: Neither this application or its author is associated with or endorsed by WYPTE."

Containing all the content from the the best-selling travel book \"Wild Swimming\" by Daniel Start (Wild Things Publishing £16.99, second edition, 2013) this app provides all you need to visit hundreds of magical rivers, lakes and waterfalls across the UK. \n\nIn this great British tour you’ll be able to swim with otters in Devon, go river-tubing in Yorkshire, night-swim under the stars in Oxfordshire and learn how to build a woodland sauna. In each area you can ready background chapters on famous wild-swimmers of the past and read stories of heroes, lovers and ordinary folk who have long enjoyed bathing under the willows. Perfect whether you are a wild swimmer, family paddler or just enjoy a waterside picnic.\n\nNOTE: due to the large number of images and places the app is slow to load first time and may not work well (or crash) if many other apps are open in parallel. Please close other apps.\n\nYou will find preloaded maps, photos, directions and travel writing to inspire and inform. Most locations comes with stunning photography and some include detailed mapping (at 1:25,000 to help walkers and 1:250,000 to help with route-planning). There is contact information for nearby pubs, campsites and attractions. If you need inspiration you can browse the app by slideshow, list, photo gallery and on an interactive map. Ask the app to find places close to you, or search using postcode, address, star rating, walk-in time, keywords or other features. You can share places on email and Facebook and save favourites too."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Pair your watch as a proper vehicle key, just like your phone! Works under all conditions, including in underground parking garages or in the middle of a desert!\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are never stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is required to supply a refresh token. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers, unless the OPTIONAL cloud processing is enabled, in which case an in-flight encrypted ACCESS token with a lifespan of 8 hours will be transmitted and stored ONLY WHILE COMMAND IS EXECUTING. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data.

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

      "label": "Octopus Watch is the easiest tool to track and stay on top of smart tariffs provided by Octopus Energy in the UK. Octopus Watch is a paymium app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch offering both a standard version and an optional subscription-only version. \n\nReady to supercharge your savings?\n\nUse the app to save big on your electricity bill, whether you are on Agile, Go, Go Faster, or Tesla tariffs. To use Octopus Watch and receive up-to-date Agile prices you only need a UK mainland postcode. For tracking of other smart tariffs (Go, Go Faster, Tesla) you need to have an Octopus Energy account. To get access to your historic usage you need to have an Octopus Energy account and an active smart meter.\n\nOctopus Watch offers full support for Agile, Go, Go Faster and Tesla import, as well as full support for Agile, SEG, fixed, and Tesla export. Octopus Watch does NOT support the Octopus Tracker tariff, Intelligent Octopus tariff, or the Powerloop tariff. Octopus Watch unofficially supports most fixed tariffs as long as you have an active smart meter. Due to a bug in Apple's Keychain the app at the moment does NOT support the Apple Watch Series 3. Support will be added again as soon as Apple fixes the Keychain bug.\n\nThe standard version gives you all the tools you need to track and stay on top of smart tariffs:\n• Immediately see the current price (also on Apple Watch!).\n• Instantly get the cheapest slot to run appliances, or charge an EV, and save big!\n• The app adjusts to the smart tariff you are on (Agile, Go, Go Faster, Tesla).\n• Easily set different appliance timers (start at, hours until start, hours until end).\n• See all upcoming rates in an easy chart and table.\n• Beautiful widget with current and upcoming prices.\n• Get a notification as soon as the next day rates are available.\n• See your historic day-by-day usage.\n• Easily compare savings against standard tariff or Agile/Go (not available if you have an export meter).\n• See how much you earned through export (only available with an export meter).\n• Various options to change the app defaults to best suit your needs!\n• Export cleaned data to CSV for easy use in other apps such as Microsoft® Excel®.\n\nWant even more? A single subscription gets you access to these amazing features:\n• Up to 48h rate predictions – better plan your usage and save more!\n• Have an export meter? Also get export rate predictions for Agile export.\n• Get an instant notification when next day prices drop below a desired threshold.\n• See the best half-hour blocks to charge an EV.\n• CO2 integration - see your environmental impact both now and in the past. \n• See the CO2 fuel composition, both as regional or national, and adjusted to your usage.\n• Get the best slot, either based on price or based on lowest CO2.\n• Day details – see your exact usage along with numerous statistics on a day-by-day basis.\n• Get half-hour details right in the app to micro-optimise your usage.\n• Create easy to read single page energy reports for any desired range over the last 4 months. \n\nThanks to Family Sharing you can install the app on all devices within the same family. Install it on your iPhone for an easy pocket reference, run it from your iPad to see the beautiful rate graph and double column table, or see the current rate with a flick of your wrist with dozens of complications to choose from. The choice is yours! Octopus Watch also supports subscription sharing, so one subscription gives you access to all the extras on all the iPhones and iPads in your household."

      "label": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

Please feel free to contact me if you have questions or need any help, via contact@oscarbouwmans.nl.\n\nEvery macro can send multiple MIDI messages, to any of the connected MIDI devices.

Etc.\n\nMIDI Devices can be connected to your iOS device via USB*, Bluetooth, or WiFi.\n*requires the Apple Camera Connection Kit or other compatible adapters\n\nMacro sets can be stored in presets. Presets can either be stored locally on the iOS device, or in iCloud, allowing you to synchronise presets between your devices. A future update will allow presets to be sent to other devices using AirDrop. This way you can send presets from your iPad to your iPhone for example, or to a friend who has a similar setup."

Use it for room correction, adjusting equalizers, setting subwoofer phase, choosing crossovers and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Sine sweep measurements\n* Display magnitude, phase and group delay\n* Compare measurements to target curve\n* Generate room correction filters (IIR or FIR)\n* Export parametric EQ settings or impulse response\n* Average and history display modes\n* Measurement save and undo\n* Use with built-in or external microphones\n* Connect with AirPlay, Bluetooth, headphone jack (analog) or use externally played sweeps\n\nHouseCurve measures in-room frequency response by listening to your audio system play a sine sweep.  Measurements are displayed on top of a target curve, making it easy to see where adjustment is needed.  Multiple measurements can be averaged to fully capture how the system sounds in the listening area.  With small changes and repeat measurements, you can manually tune your system to the target curve.  If your audio system has a parametric equalizer or convolution engine, HouseCurve can automatically generate filter settings to match the target curve.\n\nHouseCurve can help with home and car audio system tuning, from system equalization and room correction to subwoofer time alignment and speaker placement.  Visit housecurve.com for more information on how HouseCurve works and how to use it.\n\nFree trial - visit housecurve.com and give the HouseCurve app clip a try.\n\nHouseCurve will produce acceptable results with the built in iPhone/iPad microphone. Using calibrated external microphones will provide higher accuracy."

      "label": "Use your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad as a throttle for model railroad control!\n**PLEASE NOTE**  This App is not a stand-alone product!  Other hardware and software are required.\n\nLink to the popular JMRI software through a local Wi-Fi network to access throttle, address, and function controls wirelessly.\n-or-\nConnect directly to an MRC Prodigy WiFi module.\n-or-\nConnect directly to a Digitrax LnWi module.\n-or-\nConnect directly to a WifiTrax WFD-30/31.\n\nDigital Command Control (DCC) is now the most common control method for earnest model railroaders, allowing multiple trains to be controlled simultaneously anywhere on the track.  JMRI is an interface program that works with most brands of DCC and is very popular because it simplifies DCC programming, signaling, control, and many other aspects of running a permanent layout.  It is also free and multi-platform.  \n\nInstead of direct control through the DCC system, WiThrottle links with JMRI or a dedicated module.  This provides a universal interface to many possible combinations of technology and model railroads.  As DCC evolves, JMRI is updated as needed to match current technology.\n\nJMRI Requirements:\n- JMRI 2.12 or higher, JMRI 5.0 or newer recommended\n- DCC system interfaced to a computer and a model railroad\n- Local Wi-Fi network\n\nMRC Prodigy WiFi Requirements:\n- MRC Prodigy WiFi module\n- MRC Prodigy DCC system\n\nDigitrax LnWi Requirements:\n- Digitrax LnWi module\n- Digitrax DCC system\n\nWifiTrax WFD-30/31 Requirements:\n- WifiTrax WFD module\n- NCE DCC system\n\nIf you operate at either a club or private home that uses JMRI for operations and has Wi-Fi, access to the local network (host may need to share their password) is all you need.  Multiple iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad mobile devices may use their own WiThrottle app simultaneously during an operating session.  If you would like to sample WiThrottle, we offer a Lite version at no charge.  This allows you to confirm compatibility before buying the full App.\n\nPlease visit our website for additional information.  Our goal is to enhance your model railroading experience by providing convenient, wireless control of your existing system.  WiThrottle is the final piece of the puzzle.  \n\nFeatures:\n- Select road or yard throttle control arrangements\n- Dual throttle screen\n- F0 - F28 function controls\n- Build and break Advanced Consists\n- Link multiple addresses for control by one throttle (Universal Consists)\n- Control JMRI routes & turnouts\n- Imports roster list and function labels from your JMRI files\n- Access the JMRI WebServer for control panels and more\n- Adjust sensitivity of the throttle slider\n- Set for right or left hand use\n- Acquire and dispatch addresses wirelessly\n- Train idles if interrupted (e.g. phone call)\n- Control track power\n- Fastclock display\n- Automatic networking\n- Flashlight for devices equipped with camera flash\n\nWiThrottle will integrate seamlessly if:\n- you can already control a train using the built-in throttles of JMRI 2.12 or later\n- your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad can access your local wireless network (not cellular or Bluetooth)"

It can be run either manually or automatically. \n\nManual mode allows you to run the test signal and flip the phase so you can listen yourself to ensure your sound system is setup correctly. \n\nAutomatic mode will run a series of test signals through your sound system and use the microphone on the device to analyse the results.\n\nNew in version 2.0 is a waveform view mode for advanced use. It allows you to play an asymmetrical waveform (ramp waveform), record the sound from each speaker close up and capture the waveforms to then compare them. \n\nPhase is a difficult concept so full help is available in the app to ensure you get the best results.\n\nYou should check the phase of your sound system whenever the wiring has been changed to ensure everything is the correct polarity.\n\nWhen a sound systems speakers are out of phase the sound quality is affected massively. Bass is reduced significantly and stereo imaging gives the illusion of the sounds pulling outside of the room.\n\nTo run the check connect your iOS device to your sound system so it can play audio. If possible place the iOS device evenly between the speakers. Phase cancellation will not occur close to the speakers so ensure the device is not too close. Ensure the volume is at a comfortable listening level and if possible ensure there is no background noise to interfere with the scan."

Your phone controls installation of the app to the watch, not the app.  Put your watch on a charger to speed up install time;\n4. Not all audio content can be supported.

You can use a Siri Shortcut to launch the app and start speaking, just by raising your wrist on Apple Watch.  See the support page on how to configure;\n6. All watch complication types are supported, including those really weird ones.  Also you can change the complication icon under Settings;\n7. The watch app can listen automatically on launch. There is an option under settings to do the same thing on the iPhone;\n8. If the weather or time are wrong, ensure you've enabled Location access in the Alexa app to the \"Voice in a Can\" device, and that you have granted Location permissions to the app on your phone;\n9. You don't have to say \"Alexa\" ... just speak your command when the app is listening;\n10. You can change the language that you speak and hear responses in, under \"Settings\" on the watch and phone.  Only languages supported by Alexa are supported. The language should be set automatically.\n\nIf you have questions or any support issues please don't hesitate to email damian@voiceinacan.com ... you should get a response within 24 hours, and often in minutes.\n\nThis app was not created or endorsed by Amazon.

And if it's still too light for you - just slide your finger over the screen to dim the clock display or select a less intense color by tapping the time.  \n\nFeatures: \n\n* Display date and battery under the time. Or not.\n* Touch the time to set the color.\n* Slide up and down to set the intensity.\n* Pinch to resize font.\n* Works equally well in portrait and landscape modes.\n* The time always moves to ensure no burn-in.\n* Very low power consumption.\n* No ads, no in app-purchases, this is a labour of love, the only reason it's not free is to cover my App Store costs\n* Also, no user tracking. I really don't care who you are\n\nThat's it, really. Instead of having loads of functions, this app tries to do one thing and to do it well.\n\nThere are no advanced color pickers (I chose five nice colors for you!), no alarms, no background images, no distracting information.\n\nJust the time (and date and battery), beautifully displayed. \n\nKeep the time visible at all times while you sleep or daydream.\n\nFull source code can be found at https://github.com/kvasbo/natta"

No maintenance needed.\n\nMODERN\nBanish is written in Apple's latest programming paradigm Swift UI and Safari Extension functionality.\n\n---\nNOTE: Even with Banish, Smart Banners can still appear at the top for apps you have installed.

See the ratings and reviews for yourself. \n\nOther apps simply blow up the video preview without active stabilization resulting in terrible picture quality. Binoculars actually processes the full resolution photo sensor as fast as possible and then crops in on that full resolution photo image resulting in a much higher quality enlargement and a much more useful image. \n\nWhy pack binoculars when they can now be a part of your phone? Zoom in up to 32x (on latest iOS devices with Telephoto Lens) and up to 16x on older devices. For a closer look at nature, sporting events, or someone in the distance use our digital binoculars for high-resolution photo or video while in extreme zoom mode.\n\nFrom i4software, creators of Vizzywig, Flashlight and Fast Camera!\n\n• Binoculars incorporates GPS technology and displays your location on the map, shows your latitude and longitude coordinates, and remembers the exact location of your pictures. \n\n• Binoculars’ simple user-interface makes it fast and easy to use for all ages.\n\n• Includes Google Cardboard mode in landscape orientation."

      "label": "If you’re a vinyl junkie, you want your music to sound exactly as the artist intended - and that means 33⅓ RPM, not 35. Previously, checking your turntable for accuracy was difficult and inexact. But no longer. Measuring your turntable’s speed is now as simple as setting your phone down. Just start Turntabulator, place it on your platter, and start spinning. In as little as a few seconds, Turntabulator will adapt its output to your turntable, revealing its analysis in a stabilized rotating display that has to be seen to be believed. No twisting your neck - just read and be delighted.\n\nThrough the power of Musical Analysis with Gyroscopically Indifferent Calculations (MAGIC), no gyroscope is required, so Turntabulator works just fine on older devices.  In fact, the results are more accurate than the gyroscope would provide.\n\nTurntabulator offers two measurement modes.  Quick Mode will give you results within 0.1 RPM very quickly, typically in 15 seconds or less.  Or, if you’re a perfectionist, use Exact Mode for more precise results, typically reaching 0.01 RPM error or less within one or two minutes.\n\nTurntabulator will auto-sense 33⅓ or 45 RPM, or can be fixed at either setting.  It then displays the percentage error compared to the target RPM, and whether your turntable is running slow or fast.\n\nThat’s it!  Start using Turntabulator, and make sure your vinyl sounds as perfect as possible."

      "label": "\"Mosquitone Detector\" is a sound measurement app that detects high frequency noises and ultrasonic sounds hard to hear for human ears.\n\nIt may have been exposed to artificial high-frequency noise while you do not notice. This app can detect and visualize such high-frequency noises.\n \nIn general, the human audible range is said to be 20 Hz to 20 kHz, but very high frequency sounds above 10kHz will gradually become difficult to hear with age.\n\nFor example, there are increasing cases where high-frequency noise generators are installed in various places as a purpose of repelling young people and beast pests using very high frequency mosquito noises that can not be heard by general adults.\n\nEspecially for young children, there are cases that they stay in the bad place even though on a very uncomfortable noise environment because adults can not recognize at all.\nPlease use this app to find high frequency noise, so it will help you to quickly get away from the bad spot or remove the noise source.\n\nThis app has two operation modes, \"Detect\" and \"Search\". \"Detect\" can check if there are high frequency and ultrasonic sounds that you can not hear. \"Search\" can find the direction of high-frequency sound source. It can only be used when it has found the peak frequency in \"Detect\".\n\nFeatures:\n- Detection of high frequency sound and ultrasonic wave, and display the peak frequency of the highest level.\n- Search for sound source direction: 360 degrees horizontally\n- Detectable frequency range: 8kHz - 16kHz / 16KHz - 23kHz (2 band division)\n- Function to switch the gain range: 0 - 100dB / -10 - 90dB / -20 - 80dB (in Detect mode)\n\nOperating procedure:\n1) Selection of detectable frequency band\nSelect the frequency band as more than 16kHz or less than 16kHz.\n\n2) Selection of Operational mode\n- Detect mode \nIt finds an inaudible high frequency and ultrasonic sound in the frequency band more than 16 kHz (or less than 16 kHz).\nTap START button and it starts the detection function. If high frequency or ultrasonic sound exist, it will be displayed on the graph as the peak frequency. You can make the graph display easier to see by switching the gain range.\n\n- Search mode\nIt finds the direction of occurrence of the high-frequency sound source that detected the peak frequency. “Search” can be used only when high frequency or ultrasonic sound is founded in “Detect\". \nPlease make sure to hold the bottom built-in microphone of iPhone so that it faces outward. If you measure with the microphone facing inward, microphone sensitivity will deteriorate and accurate measurement will not be possible.\nTap Start button, and firmly hold the iPhone terminal, please turn slowly clockwise. Recommended that the time required for a rotation is about 15 seconds and the rotation speed in the graph is approximately 4 rpm.\nThe measurement is completed by one revolution, and the signal strength of the peak frequency is displayed on the pie chart. You can find approximate direction of the high-frequency sound source relative to your standing position.\n\n3) Snapshot\nTap SNAP button, you can save the measurement result as “Photos” as an image file. A timestamp is inserted in the image.\n\nNote:\nIf the frequency changes periodically or randomly, it is not possible to determine the direction of occurrence in \"Search\".\nUltrasonic measurement depends on the sensitivity characteristics of the built-in microphone, so the measurement result may vary.\n\nRemarks:\nIt is still under study about health effects on human body by listening to high-frequencies including ultrasonic sound. If the high frequency noise of high level is detected daily, we recommend that you consult an expert.\n\nPlease visit our iOS App Support page for more information on this app."

      "label": "In this the limited but therefore free version of Clinometer. It as all features but can not be calibrated. This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day. \n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device in every direction. When the device is put flat on the table a bubble view will fade in. The current features include: \n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering) \n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Volume Button Lock: Use volume buttons to trigger the lock.\n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode.\n\nOnly the full version has a two way calibration feature!\n\nPlease support us and buy the full version if you can. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features.\n\n► Check out all our products (free and paid) on www.plaincode.com"

      "label": "iPGMail is an app that implements the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880, RFC 6637) and allows the user to create and manage both public and private (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, EDDSA, ECDH) PGP keys and send and receive PGP encrypted messages.\n\nPGP Keys and Messages can be passed to iPGMail several ways:\n    * From the iOS Mail.app - The iOS mail application will pass PGP attachments to iPGMail directly, eliminating the need to do an awkward copy-and-paste.  NOTE: PGP messages that are part of the main body of an email will still have to be copy-and-pasted, only properly tagged attachments can be passed automatically.\n\n    * Directly from the system clipboard.  Copy-and-paste the PGP message text from any file, webpage, or message, and it can be imported and decrypted by the app.\n\n    * iTunes File Sharing -  Connect your device to a computer and open up iTunes, in the \"Apps\" section, you can scroll down and select iPGMail under the File Sharing section and transfer files to and from the app to your computer. Make sure device is unlocked before transferring files!\n\n    * AirDrop - Transfer key files from your Mac OS/X system (10.10 or later) to your iPhone/iPad (iOS 7+) using AirDrop feature.\n\n    * DropBox - You can link iPGMail to a dropbox account and transfer files to and from your dropbox file space.  This means you can encrypt and protect your dropbox files or share files with others through your existing dropbox Public interface.\n\n    * Keybase.IO - You can import public keys from http://keybase.io by using the \"+\" button on the public key listing and then searching for users registered in keybase.io.\n\niPGMail now allows you to easily reply to encrypted text-based messages and includes the original text with \"> \" prefixed to the lines.  This allows for more email like conversational exchanges, all with strong OpenPGP cryptographic protection.\n\niPGMail supports PGP key generation (RSA) directly in the app and stores them securely using the iOS keychain for the application.  Using your own private PGP keys, you can encrypt and/or digitally sign any messages.  Optionally, your public key can be attached to any message you send from the app so that the recipient can then import it into their own keychain, either on the phone or on any computer with PGP support.\n\niPGMail will import your private keys so you can reuse your existing PGP identity and keys on your iPhone or iPad.  Both public and private keys can be imported through the interfaces listed above.\n\niPGMail allows the user to search public SKS PGP keyservers to find registered public keys for other people with whom the user can then send email that is digitally signed and/or encrypted encoded in OpenPGP ASCII Armor.\n\nThis app is ideal for securing your files or for sending secure email messages to specific parties without worrying about it being viewed by anyone other than the designated recipient.  \n\nThe OpenPGP standard is described here: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

Support will be added again as soon as Apple fixes the Keychain bug.\n\nThe standard version gives you all the tools you need to track and stay on top of smart tariffs:\n• Immediately see the current price (also on Apple Watch!).\n• Instantly get the cheapest slot to run appliances, or charge an EV, and save big!\n• The app adjusts to the smart tariff you are on (Agile, Go, Go Faster, Tesla).\n• Easily set different appliance timers (start at, hours until start, hours until end).\n• See all upcoming rates in an easy chart and table.\n• Beautiful widget with current and upcoming prices.\n• Get a notification as soon as the next day rates are available.\n• See your historic day-by-day usage.\n• Easily compare savings against standard tariff or Agile/Go (not available if you have an export meter).\n• See how much you earned through export (only available with an export meter).\n• Various options to change the app defaults to best suit your needs!\n• Export cleaned data to CSV for easy use in other apps such as Microsoft® Excel®.\n\nWant even more? A single subscription gets you access to these amazing features:\n• Up to 48h rate predictions – better plan your usage and save more!\n• Have an export meter? Also get export rate predictions for Agile export.\n• Get an instant notification when next day prices drop below a desired threshold.\n• See the best half-hour blocks to charge an EV.\n• CO2 integration - see your environmental impact both now and in the past. \n• See the CO2 fuel composition, both as regional or national, and adjusted to your usage.\n• Get the best slot, either based on price or based on lowest CO2.\n• Day details – see your exact usage along with numerous statistics on a day-by-day basis.\n• Get half-hour details right in the app to micro-optimise your usage.\n• Create easy to read single page energy reports for any desired range over the last 4 months. \n\nThanks to Family Sharing you can install the app on all devices within the same family. Install it on your iPhone for an easy pocket reference, run it from your iPad to see the beautiful rate graph and double column table, or see the current rate with a flick of your wrist with dozens of complications to choose from.

Your phone controls installation of the app to the watch, not the app.  Put your watch on a charger to speed up install time;\n4. Not all audio content can be supported.  Amazon don't allow third-party apps such as this app to play music, audio books or some daily-news content, make announcements or drop-in;\n5. You can use a Siri Shortcut to launch the app and start speaking, just by raising your wrist on Apple Watch.  See the support page on how to configure;\n6. All watch complication types are supported, including those really weird ones.  Also you can change the complication icon under Settings;\n7. The watch app can listen automatically on launch. There is an option under settings to do the same thing on the iPhone;\n8. If the weather or time are wrong, ensure you've enabled Location access in the Alexa app to the \"Voice in a Can\" device, and that you have granted Location permissions to the app on your phone;\n9. You don't have to say \"Alexa\" ... just speak your command when the app is listening;\n10. You can change the language that you speak and hear responses in, under \"Settings\" on the watch and phone.  Only languages supported by Alexa are supported. The language should be set automatically.\n\nIf you have questions or any support issues please don't hesitate to email damian@voiceinacan.com ... you should get a response within 24 hours, and often in minutes.\n\nThis app was not created or endorsed by Amazon.

This allows you to write your applications for use with devices such as puck.js in a language you are more familiar with (i.e. javascript) and be able to use it from your iOS device.\n\nUse the built-in console viewer to debug issues when running your site on WebBLE.\n\nSecurity is important for bluetooth device access, and so only sites that use https are supported, and it is not possible to connect to a bluetooth device without permission being granted by the user.\n\nInitially the following key APIs are supported:\n\n- bluetooth.requestDevice()\n\n- BluetoothDevice.gatt\n- BluetoothDevice.addEventListener('gattserverdisconnected', cb)\n\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTServer.connect()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTServer.disconnect()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTServer.getPrimaryService()\n\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTService.getCharacteristic()\n\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic.writeValue()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic.readValue()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic.startNotifications()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic.stopNotifications()\n- BluetoothRemoteGATTCharacteristic.addEventListener(\"characteristicvaluechanged\", cb)"

      "label": "The Miracle Box is an app used for Spirit Communication and ITC Research. You must use this correctly, responsibly and by using it you are doing so at your own risk. To see the full information and Q&A on how to use this app correctly, you can visit: https://huffparanormal.com/2021/05/the-miracle-box-spirit-communication-app-is-here/\n\nThe Miracle Box includes methods used by Steve Huff of Huff Paranormal in his Astral Doorway and Miracle Box full size devices. The app has eleven banks, which are all reversed human speech. There are no words, no music, no phrases and nothing programmed in to make you think spirit is speaking with you. This is an advanced yet simple ITC app based on eleven years of research and communication. It will not work for everyone (no app or box does). \n\nWhen using it, you must do so correctly. If you do not have a connection to spirit you will not hear replies come through. Instead, you will hear gibberish, nothing. That is by design. This app is designed to only bring you true responses, if and only if you connect with a spirit when using it. No matter the app or device you use, the connection is the #1 aspect of getting results. \n\nAlways use this with love, respect, kindness and a clear mind. If you do not hear replies, try again at another time, or a different place. Do not use it if you are angry, depressed, in a negative mood or fearful of it. If you fear this, do not use this app as fear is an energy we put out that can and could attract undesirable spirits. Love is the key here and this is meant for serous ITC researchers and enthusiasts. \n\nJust pick a voice, press record, ask a question and move the slider to the right for 1-3 seconds and then slide it back. You will soon hear a voice emerge that will either be answering you (if you connected) or gibberish (if you did not). Even if you do not hear a reply in real time, always check the recording as it could have changed. \n\nThis is a tool you can grow with. To learn how to build a connection, and see demo videos with this app in action visit the Huff Paranormal YouTube Channel."

This is a small floor heating calculation app.\n\nDetermine the required water temperature, number of pipe loops, heat losses and more parameters of a hydronic underfloor heating system.\n\nFloor Heating application makes it easy to design and understand hydronic underfloor heating systems. While many parameters can be set, the workflow remains simple. \nThe application is suitable for calculation of hydronic underfloor heating systems with pipes laid in a screed layer below floor covering. It can be used for a wide range of conditions: small or large systems, different floor coverings, different room locations, different insulation thicknesses and conductivities etc. \n\nResults include a wide range of values, including:\n- floor surface temperature;\n- required water flow and return temperatures;\n- required number of pipe loops;\n- heat output of a single pipe loop and all loops in a room;\n- heat losses downwards;\n- required water volume flow rate;\n- pressure drop of underfloor heating loops;\n- total pipe length;\n- a warning if the required temperatures are too high (damage to the floor structure, medical issues);\n\nNote: it is recommended to perform calculations for every room separately, though it is also possible to enter a larger portion of a building's area and get an instant preview of what will be needed when designing an underfloor heating system. \n\nResults are instantaneous and accurate. \n\nBasic floor heating characteristics can be quickly determined. It is interesting to observe how different floor coverings, insulation thickness and specific heat losses of a room or a larger part of a building affect the required water temperature in order to keep the room warm. \n\nModern low-energy and passive houses require lower water temperatures than houses with poor thermal insulation. This application will help determine just how low.\n\nNotes:\n- metric units only;\n- room/building heat load must be calculated separately. This application does not do that: it only offers a few guidelines;\n- the application does not offer graphical layout of pipes;"

However, the list of transmitters with the bearing will still work. \n\n*** IPAD - IMPORTANT *** WIFI only Ipad devices do not have GPS. Therefore, depending on the type of Internet connection available, the GPS system in the oapp may not work. In these cases the location can be specified using postcode.\n\n*** Jersey / Channel Islands *** the postcode function is unlikely to work due to the data not being available for these areas. GPS will continue to work fine on supported devices.\n\n3G or 4G Ipads will work with this app as they have the GPS chip.\n\nMagnetic covers can affect the compass hardware, if you experience problems with the compass, try removing the case.

Use it for room correction, adjusting equalizers, setting subwoofer phase, choosing crossovers and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Sine sweep measurements\n* Display magnitude, phase and group delay\n* Compare measurements to target curve\n* Generate room correction filters (IIR or FIR)\n* Export parametric EQ settings or impulse response\n* Average and history display modes\n* Measurement save and undo\n* Use with built-in or external microphones\n* Connect with AirPlay, Bluetooth, headphone jack (analog) or use externally played sweeps\n\nHouseCurve measures in-room frequency response by listening to your audio system play a sine sweep.  Measurements are displayed on top of a target curve, making it easy to see where adjustment is needed.  Multiple measurements can be averaged to fully capture how the system sounds in the listening area.  With small changes and repeat measurements, you can manually tune your system to the target curve.  If your audio system has a parametric equalizer or convolution engine, HouseCurve can automatically generate filter settings to match the target curve.\n\nHouseCurve can help with home and car audio system tuning, from system equalization and room correction to subwoofer time alignment and speaker placement.  Visit housecurve.com for more information on how HouseCurve works and how to use it.\n\nFree trial - visit housecurve.com and give the HouseCurve app clip a try.\n\nHouseCurve will produce acceptable results with the built in iPhone/iPad microphone. Using calibrated external microphones will provide higher accuracy."

Huh?\n\nBlood Alcohol Content, or BAC, refers to the percentage of alcohol in a person's bloodstream, and can be measured within 30-70 minutes after drinking. Contrary to popular belief, nothing can lower BAC except time; coffee, cold showers, and chugging glasses of water will not help you sober up any faster. \n\nProduct vision\n\nCurious what your BAC might be? You'll be able to use this app to estimate, but don't forget that everyone metabolizes alcohol (beer, wine, liquor) differently. Our calculator can give you an approximate BAC level, but do not rely upon it to determine if you're fit to drive or work.\n\nI deeply believe this tool could really help people make smarter choices.

Amplosion shows how many times it has activated with a beautiful flip counter at the top of the app so you can see how many times it's saved the day. There's also a myriad of beautiful app icons to choose from. \n\nIt's completely open source, so with this transparency you can verify everything about the extension.\n\nAwesome home screen widgets are included as well, featuring the flip counter so you can see how many times Amplosion has activated right from your home screen.\n\nAs a bonus, it features a lovable digital dog that lives in the app named Lord Waffles, and a beautiful story about him and his turtle friend Rascal.

Additionally, all of this information is available off-line, so if your favorite Apothecary is out of cell range and you're looking for that special Crystal, Herb or Essential Oil then your Book of Shadows is still only a tap away!\n\nBook of Shadows is all about positive energies and does not contain anything which is harmful to others or deals in the darker side of magick (occult, Black Magick).\n\nFor more information about Book of Shadows check out\nhttp://www.bookofshadows.com.au/"

With Number Shield, block an entire group of numbers at once.  Just enter a wildcard for each digit you want to block.\n\nFor example, if your number is 714-555-1234, scammers might use a number like 714-555-6789.  Block all similar numbers by entering 714-555-####.  Wildcards and numbers can be combined in any order you choose.  Block international numbers, too!\n\nUse the \"Allow Contacts\" option to make sure you don't miss calls from your family and friends.\n\nBlock numbers directly from your phone's missed calls screen.  Just follow these steps:\n\n1. Tap the “ i ” button next to the missed call.\n2. Tap “Share Contact”.\n3. Tap “Block Similar Numbers”.  (If you don't see this action, tap “Edit Actions...“ to enable it.)\n4. Now you'll see the Number Shield number entry screen.  Tap “Done” to block calls from similar numbers.\n\nPlease note:\n\n• Each number pattern can contain up to 7 wildcards, and up to 50,000,000 phone numbers can be blocked.\n• Blocked calls are sent directly to voice mail.\n• Blocked text messages are sent to the “Junk” filter in the Messages app.\n• iMessage messages are not blocked.\n• When “Do Not Disturb” is enabled on your phone, calls that should be blocked may appear in your phone's list of missed calls.\n\nMore information about caller ID spoofing in the United States is available from the FCC:\n\nhttps://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/spoofing-and-caller-id"

      "label": "Sunnytrack transforms your device into a professional tool for planning sunlight, the sun’s position, path and shadows for every place in the world (and at every time) accurately, on the map or in AR. Whether for photography, real estate, your new flat or house, gardening, photovoltaics or all outdoor activities: sunlight, sun position and shadows play a major role. See sun’s elevation, its direction, exact sun movement over day and year, objects’ shadows, shadow lengths, shadow differences between seasons, and more.\n\nRECOMMENDED BY PROFESSIONALS:\n\n„This app is awesome! It has helped me to align the PV modules (solar panels) optimally.“ – Jürgen\n\n„For me as a photographer Sunnytrack is an extremely practical tool. Always knowing the sun’s position in real time brings enormous relief. Planning photo shootings becomes significantly easier.“ – Aki from Akigrafie Live\n\n„I am absolutely thrilled. I work in the real estate industry and can now use AR to check with my clients when the sun is shining on the balcony. Amazed customers guaranteed.“ – Toni K.\n\n„It's very useful and professional. It helps me coordinate my trips.“ – Dino\n\nPHILOSOPHY: No ads. No user tracking. Sunnytrack tracks the sun, but only the sun, not the user! For sure. This app is a professional product. It can be bought for a one-time price to get all the high quality features it offers at once, without distracting ads or the need for further in app purchases.\n\n• CREATORS (in photography/filming) all over the world love Sunnytrack not only for its easy usage but also for the extensive functionality it offers. With it you're guaranteed to not miss a perfect scene and optimal light – during the day, Golden Hour or Blue Hour, for instance. Precise, location-dependent planning of the sun’s position and natural lighting of your subjects are extremely relevant in photography – whether capturing landscapes, objects or humans.\n\n• You would like to know the effective AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT a flat or house/property offers? During Winter, when days are shorter? Get a general picture in advance on Maps or impress at site visits and property tours with showing the sun’s path at the kitchen window for the whole year, live in 3D in your camera image using Augmented Reality (AR)! It’s an insiders’ tip for real estate agents, house builders or interested individuals in general.\n\n• PHOTOVOLTAICS: Sunnytrack provides professional support in placing, adjusting and optimizing your solar modules. Where does sun rise, where does it set? See the differences between the seasons at your location.\n\n• We love green! We love GARDENS. Plan your garden with Sunnytrack. Simulate the exact shadows of multiple objects in Shadow Simulation mode, by adding them on the map defining their heights. For example, you can see the length and impact of shadows casted by objects like houses or a trees when the sun follows its path.\n\n• SAVE all planned scenes, sun paths, shadow simulations and your places for later use.\n\n• As you can see in the screenshots, DAY VIEW provides precise, location-dependent information on the sun like day length, solar noon, sunrise, sunset and twilight times (like Blue Hour, Golden Hour, Astronomical Twilight, …)\n\n• For all OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES Sunnytrack wants to be your faithful companion as a sun tracker and planner. Whether in cities, in the mountains or when touring through valleys, meadows and fields, the app develops its full potential: on Maps, live in AR or even in advance when planning.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nIdeas and feedback are very welcome. Please use the provided feedback function in the app.\n\nAR 3D functionality: Sunnytrack shows the sun’s position and path based on the orientation of your device with high precision. For identifying its orientation, your devices’ internal sensors are used. In order to achieve exact results, a calibration can be required by moving your device in a figure-eight-pattern and keeping it away of metallic objects."

Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

A lot of thought has gone into this truly excellent product.\"\n\"This is a superb program and does what it says simply and efficiently. The developer responds promptly to suggestions. Importing Contacts works well and changes are instantly carried through. My cards have never been sent out so early!\"\n\"I love how this app has streamlined addressing my Christmas cards!! Thank you!!\"\n\"AddressLabels delivers an extremely effective way to manage card lists which means the ability to easily compose lists from your Contacts, get the labels printed, and keep track of cards received and sent! Add the ability to manually enter list members, assign nicknames, select from multiple addresses, intelligent handling the country portion of the address, accommodate a large range of label types, AirPrint directly or produce a PDF of the labels, clone new lists from existing lists, all wrapped in a visually pleasing interface. Winner!\"\n\"I hate addressing my Christmas cards. This app made it very easy to make labels. I don't have a printer that works with my iPad yet, so I really appreciated having the capability to send them as a PDF to my email address. The app is awesome...\"\n“Just what you need at this time of year - a reliable self updating list to speed up sending out cards. This is the 3rd or 4th year I've used it and it just gets better and better.”\n“After years of tearing my hair out trying to get labels out of my iphone/iPad/iMac combo, an app that actually does what it promised!”"

      "label": "iCab Mobile is a web browser for the iOS. It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nAPPLE WATCH:\nThe Watch App is a remote control for iCab Mobile, so you can navigate, zoom, scroll, open bookmarks, links, the homepage, switch tabs or sitch on/off the fullscreen mode. Since watchOS 6.2 you can also open web pages and browse the Web directly on the Apple Watch. But there are a few limitations: The watchOS will always show a privacy warning when starting a browsing session and there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders. You can import/export the bookmarks from/to your PC/Mac browser. \n\nFULLSCREEN MODE:\niCab Mobile provides a fullscreen mode where the whole screen is used to display the web page. No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

The longer you have Battery Grapher installed, the more accurate future battery level predictions will be.\n\nLOW ENERGY CONSUMPTION\nBattery Grapher is made for people who want to extend the battery life, meaning that low energy usage is a priority. The app runs a background task only once an hour, and doesn't require a network connection, which keeps energy consumption extremely low.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE NOTIFICATIONS \nBattery Grapher allows you to set notifications that fit your needs. You can  get the app to notify you when you battery drops below a preset percentage, or if you only have a certain number of hours left before your battery runs out. (currently only available on watchOS)\n\nALL COMPLICATIONS & WIDGET SIZES SUPPORTED\nBattery Grapher supports all complications & widget sizes. Complications can show hours before needing to charge, or battery %. Both complications and widgets are customizable from within the app."

Simply select wind direction in degrees, windspeed and TAS in kts and let the app do the work for you!\nThe groundspeed figures appear in green, and correction angle applied to heading to maintain track are shown in blue.  These are displayed around the compass rose.  Interpolation between the compass points give data for all 360 degrees.\n \nUse it for navigation planning, diversion techniques, or planning drift in the hold. Take the mental stress out of practical diversions.\n \nThe windstar app is based around the theory of maximum drift, and compatible with many teaching techniques including the Navigation Rule DP-1, available at www.digital-innovations.co.uk\n\nPlease note that all data is for information only and is not a substitute for primary navigation techniques."

Maintaining husbandry tasks, testing, stability, water changes, inhabitant stats etc. are all vital to keeping successful aquariums. \n\nPocket Marine was designed to make inputting, storing and keeping all information with you at ease. Often, any issues that we have with our aquariums can be linked to actions that were performed a short time beforehand. For this reason, a log of changes made, actions performed or additions can be vital when trying to decipher a problem that may be in play. Pen and paper has always been a great way to keep this information at hand but, Pocket Marine offers a place to store this somewhere that, this day and age, is with us at all times.\n\nNot just for tracking events. Pocket Marine is a great way to help you log your inhabitants into specific tanks, record your latest water change for your mixed reef tank or simply log your latest maintenance action performed on the fish only office tank. Recording your information couldnt be easier and keeping it on your mobile device saves on that frantic search incase of needing the information at a later date.\n\nHelp with that last second impulse buy at the store. With an in depth library of over 800 species of fish, invertebrates and coral and being added to daily, you will always have the information on hand that you need to make that informed decision on a purchase. \n\nWe hope you enjoy using the app and that we can help with your success in the hobby and welcome any feature requests you may have.\n\nHappy Reefing!"

You can launch the app to view an animated display of live data (updated every 10 seconds while it's open), or add a complication to your watch face so that you always know how much battery you have left. Note that complications aren't allowed to refresh as often, so that will update roughly every 30 minutes if you add one.\n\nThe app displays solar, battery, grid and home power usage as well as how much charge is left in your Powerwall.\n\nThere's two main items in the app, showing live power data as well as a daily summary total telling you how much solar you've generated, home power used and how much grid power you've imported and exported.\n\nThis is a fully stand-alone watch app, it can run stand-alone and without your Apple Watch once you've signed in.\n\nNew to version 1.4, this app now works with solar only installations as well, so you don't need a Powerwall to use it, if you have Tesla solar panels you can see live stats and a day summary for that as well!\n\nAs of version 2.0, this app supports 2FA/MFA accounts as well.\n\nWe use this app personally every day and will endeavour to keep it up to date and add more features over time.\n\nNote:\nA Tesla Powerwall or a Tesla Solar Installation, and Tesla account are required to use this app. Your account details are stored in the built in secure Keychain on your device. They are only transmitted to Tesla's servers for authentication purposes on login. This app contains no first or third party tracking whatsoever. We take great care to respect your privacy and your data remains your data.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis app is not made or endorsed by Tesla. It's built by nerds who couldn't get enough of watching that mesmerising Powerwall animation and wanted it on their watches. It has an iPhone counterpart only because it needs to use a web based login to work."

In this complication you'll see all events and reminder of the day and got the next one display above. This complication supports up to 6 calendars at the same time.\n\nHUGE Update: Now you can choose your favorite style!\n\n· Fixed timeline: Fixed timespan from 6 am to 12 am\n\n· Dynamic timeline: The timeline shows the timespan from first to last event of the day with 1 hour padding each side\n\n· Dynamic timeline with actual time: Like dynamic but with the actual time marker (if before first or past last event)\n\n· Moving timeline: You will see a 4 hour timespan for the future and the timeline is moving through the day (only style where the next day do not get shown when after 6 pm and past the last event)\n\n· Also you can choose if you like the full big image on your watch face or like the next event text on top of the timeline.\n\n· You can switch on text in timeline which (mostly) fully displays your event text.\n\n· Even add you favorite tint color (disables text in timeline).\n\nWith these settings you can configure your own style on you own watch face!\n\n\n** IMPORTANT NOTE ** \n\nThe big graph complication only runs with Apple Watch Series 4 and higher (high detail watch faces like Modular Duo, Infograph Modular or Infograph Compact watch faces). MDM (company) managed devices may do not provide calendar data even when granted access since watchOS only apps cannot read MDM profiles."

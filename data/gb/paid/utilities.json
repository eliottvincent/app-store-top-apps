      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "Octopus Watch is the easiest tool to track and stay on top of smart tariffs provided by Octopus Energy in the UK. Octopus Watch is a paymium app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch offering both a standard version and an optional subscription-only version. \n\nReady to supercharge your savings?\n\nUse the app to save big on your electricity bill, whether you are on Agile, Go, Go Faster, or Tesla tariffs. To use Octopus Watch and receive up-to-date Agile prices you only need a UK mainland postcode. For tracking of other smart tariffs (Go, Go Faster, Tesla) you need to have an Octopus Energy account. To get access to your historic usage you need to have an Octopus Energy account and an active smart meter.\n\nOctopus Watch offers full support for Agile, Go, Go Faster and Tesla import, as well as full support for Agile, SEG, fixed, and Tesla export. Octopus Watch does NOT support the Octopus Tracker tariff, Intelligent Octopus tariff, or the Powerloop tariff. Octopus Watch unofficially supports most fixed tariffs as long as you have an active smart meter. Due to a bug in Apple's Keychain the app at the moment does NOT support the Apple Watch Series 3. Support will be added again as soon as Apple fixes the Keychain bug.\n\nThe standard version gives you all the tools you need to track and stay on top of smart tariffs:\n• Immediately see the current price (also on Apple Watch!).\n• Instantly get the cheapest slot to run appliances, or charge an EV, and save big!\n• The app adjusts to the smart tariff you are on (Agile, Go, Go Faster, Tesla).\n• Easily set different appliance timers (start at, hours until start, hours until end).\n• See all upcoming rates in an easy chart and table.\n• Beautiful widget with current and upcoming prices.\n• Get a notification as soon as the next day rates are available.\n• See your historic day-by-day usage.\n• Easily compare savings against standard tariff or Agile/Go (not available if you have an export meter).\n• See how much you earned through export (only available with an export meter).\n• Various options to change the app defaults to best suit your needs!\n• Export cleaned data to CSV for easy use in other apps such as Microsoft® Excel®.\n\nWant even more? A single subscription gets you access to these amazing features:\n• Up to 48h rate predictions – better plan your usage and save more!\n• Have an export meter? Also get export rate predictions for Agile export.\n• Get an instant notification when next day prices drop below a desired threshold.\n• See the best half-hour blocks to charge an EV.\n• CO2 integration - see your environmental impact both now and in the past. \n• See the CO2 fuel composition, both as regional or national, and adjusted to your usage.\n• Get the best slot, either based on price or based on lowest CO2.\n• Day details – see your exact usage along with numerous statistics on a day-by-day basis.\n• Get half-hour details right in the app to micro-optimise your usage.\n• Create easy to read single page energy reports for any desired range over the last 4 months. \n\nThanks to Family Sharing you can install the app on all devices within the same family. Install it on your iPhone for an easy pocket reference, run it from your iPad to see the beautiful rate graph and double column table, or see the current rate with a flick of your wrist with dozens of complications to choose from. The choice is yours! Octopus Watch also supports subscription sharing, so one subscription gives you access to all the extras on all the iPhones and iPads in your household."

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

In detailed mode, the text being encoded is scrolling through the decoding process. \n\nTap some morse code onto the screen and the program will translate it into some text. \nDifferent input types are handled : Novice, Straight key, Memory Paddle, Iambic Paddle (A and B), Microphone. Left and right handed modes supported. \nTest and improve your skills : are you good enough to be understood? \n\nCreate audio files containing Morse code in a dynamic way or from a given text.\nUse those files as you wish : listen to them to train your decoding skills or use them as ringtones for your phone.\n\nExclusive feature allowing to decode, in real time, the Morse code recorded from the microphone into Text (the sound must be quite clear/loud and without much noise). \nSome automatic calibration is performed, allowing adaptation to speed, tone and volume changes. \n\nThe full Morse alphabet can also be consulted and the associated Morse code can be played. \nTapped and decoded text can be edited and exported to the clipboard, the In-app email and SMS. \nA special screen allows textual conversion of morse code and text. Exchange encoded messages with your friends. \n\nWikipedia and Visual Mnemonic screens allowing to get informations and mnemonics regarding morse code.\nYou can also add your own web sites for an in-app consultation.\nAll the application is highly configurable (Frequency, WPM, tone type, color, morse characters, variables ...) \n\n!!! As seen on TV !!! (UK) in Most Haunted Live: Apparently you can use it to communicate with ghosts (no guaranty though) \n\nPremium features can also be unlocked as a single in-app purchase : \nKoch trainer screen, CWops Academy learning method, Quiz screen, Prosigns, Macros, Dictionaries : abbreviations, QSOs, mnemonics, Timing (farnsworth) and Morse alphabet/prosigns personalization, look customization ... and more.\n\nMorse-it is powered by Icom, a world leader in the amateur radio market."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "iCab Mobile is a web browser for the iOS. It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nAPPLE WATCH:\nThe Watch App is a remote control for iCab Mobile, so you can navigate, zoom, scroll, open bookmarks, links, the homepage, switch tabs or sitch on/off the fullscreen mode. Since watchOS 6.2 you can also open web pages and browse the Web directly on the Apple Watch. But there are still limitations: there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders. You can import/export the bookmarks from/to your PC/Mac browser. \n\nFULLSCREEN MODE:\niCab Mobile provides a fullscreen mode where the whole screen is used to display the web page. No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

      "label": "SPLnFFT is a sound level meter (noise meter) for your iPhone or iPad with many advanced features: frequency analyzer, frequency meter, test signal generator, dosimeter, ...\n\nThis soundmeter App is the only one for iOS recommended by the \"Laborers' Health and Safety Fund of North America\".\nHere are extracts from other reviews:\n\"our favorite sound measurement app\" SafetyAwakenings.com\n\"SPLnFFT is comprehensive, easy to use\" TapeOp.com\nYou will find more reviews here: https://www.facebook.com/SPLnFFT\n\nFor daily use, a very simple interface displays the level of exposure: if orange or red, protect your ears !\nProfessional users will take advantage of a wide range of accurate and reliable measurements: Leq, peak, L10, L95, taktmaximal, frequency analysis, histogram, dosemetering, ... A&C weightings are compliant with ANSI® S1.42 standard. \"468\" refers to ITU-R 468-4\n\n>>> Some KEY INFORMATION <<< :\n- you absolutely need to allow access to microphone to use this App\n- screen rotation must be un-locked\n- there are built-in help messages (speech bubble). Need more ? Contact us !: email, blog, Facebook,...\n- do not expect to measure as low as 0dB(A) in a quiet room, for these 2 reasons: 30-130dB(A) is the standard usable range for sound level meters and anyway a standard quiet room is around 30dB(A) whereas a typical anechoic chamber is 10 to 20dB(A)\n- to change frequency weightings (dB(A),dB(C),...) a LONG PRESS is required (1/3rd of a second). This is to avoid accidental changes\n\nTop digital display is for measurement of sound power in 'slow' mode (averaged on 1s). Central analog display is for 'fast' mode (averaged on 1/8th s). But it can display 'slow' mode as well on request: just click on 'fast' label.\nPeak and average values are displayed below and are held until you touch the 'reset' label. The videos on Youtube reveal more details.\n\nBottom view is a real time FFT (frequency analysis). You will notice that predominant frequency and next one are highlighted. Their frequencies and relative power are displayed on the right. If your input signal is a pure tone then this App will lock on its frequency and display a very accurate result.\nGreen line is the result of a real time FFT done with 1024 points. Purple line is the averaged FFT (exponential filtering done on power of each frequency). Blue line is a copy of what the purple line was when the user froze the display the last time.\nA test tone at 1kHz or a white noise or a pink noise can be generated and sent to right and/or left outputs (select the type you want in BEEP tab). This FFT view - more precisely an upsized version of it - can be exported as a picture in your own photo library, using the camera button (when display is frozen only).  This picture can be exported in a mail as well.\nThe display can be flipped upside-down to ease reading: just rotate your iPhone while holding it vertically.\n\nAs for ALL sound meters (thus including this one and all others at any price), calibration is suggested if you want to reach extreme precision. This is enabled in this App thanks to a slider to apply some compensation and to three non volatile memories (choice to be made in MIC. tab). How to ? For calibration, you need and external reference, either a calibrated sound meter, or a calibrated noise source.\nNote as well that the tiny embedded loudspeaker cannot reproduce extreme frequencies. Thus if you want to hear a real white or pink noise, you will need to use a quality headphone or HiFi system.\n\nThis App was designed seriously for our own needs, by a signal processing expert, and is regularly updated to maintain accuracy and reliability.\n\n***** Any comment, any feedback ? Click on 'support' in iTunes: there is a blog for this. You can even contact us directly by email  or through the dedicated FaceBook page (note 'send email' top right) *****"

Save time watching videos - without missing out on any content. Or watch a live stream's recorded part at increased speed - until you're \"back to live\".\n\n• CONTROL: jump ±10 seconds, use the position slider and - of course - play and pause.\n\n• ACTUAL TIME REMAINING: see how much _actual_ time remains to the end of the video - adjusted to the playback speed.\n\n• LIVE STREAM CLOCK: see the approximate clock time for your current position in the live stream, making it really easy to find f.ex. the beginning of a show.\n\n• PICTURE IN PICTURE (PiP): move web videos to picture in picture - and continue watching while using other apps.\n\n• FULLSCREEN: enlarge web videos to fullscreen.\n\n• MUTE/UNMUTE: mute and unmute web videos.\n\n\nSUPPORTED WEBSITES\n\nVidimote was written and designed to work with HTML5 web videos everywhere - and in our testing it has, including the websites of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Twitch, TED.com, Udemy, Khan Academy, MagentaTV, Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, Facebook, ownCloud, Nextcloud, Dropbox, Amazon Drive, Google Drive and OneDrive.\n\nGiven the sheer number of websites out there, however, we can't guarantee that Vidimote works with every single web video out there.

      "label": "HamAntCal Version 3.5 (Ham Antenna Calculator) will simply and intuitively calculate for you the starting length needed for constructing your antennas in feet/inches or in metric.\n\nIt will calculate the starting length for \"Dipole's\", \"Inverted Vee's\", \"Vertical's\" and has a page for calculating 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 5/8 and \"Full Wave\" length.\n\nIn this update:\n\n▪HamAntCal has been updated to 64 bit and iPhone X\n\n▪New updated interface and settings menu\n\n▪New in app purchase to update features\n\n▪This update requires iOS 8.2 and above.\n\n  --------------------------------------- \n\n▪      HamAntCal works in feet/inches as well as metric. \n\n▪      The easy to use and intuitive interface makes it easy to calculate starting lengths for building your antennas. It will calculate the starting length for \"Dipoles\", \"Verticals\" and \"Inverted Vee\" antennas. There is also a page for calculating  1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 5/8 and \"Full Wave\" length.\n\n▪      I have come across a lot of different and conflicting information for calculating the length of an \"Inverted Vee\" antenna. Some say subtract 2 to 5 percent based on the angle of the wires. Others say to add a percentage based on the angle of the wires down from horizontal. \n       I decided to test this before releasing this app. First I calculated for a \"Dipole\" using the \"Dipole\" calculator. Then I put together a \"Dipole\" with a support for the center insulator as well as the ends. I measured the resonant frequency with an antenna analyzer. Then I brought the ends down towards 45 degrees from horizontal. As the ends were lowered the resonant frequency increased. \n       This means that the length of the \"Inverted Vee\" would need to be increased to stay resonant at the same frequency as the dipole. The \"Inverted Vee\" calculator has a slider that starts up with an angle of 45 degrees and can be adjusted down to 20 degrees continuously re-calculating as it is moved. This corresponds to about 4.5 to 2 percent added to the length of the \"Inverted Vee\".\n\n▪     No antenna calculator can give exact results in every case. Much will depend on the wire used, the height above ground, the ground itself, nearby objects, etc….  It's always a good practice to add a little extra wire and then trim up to the desired frequency.\n\n▪     This calculator will calculate from 30 Khz to 500Mhz for the \"Dipole\", \"Vertical\" and \"Length\" calculators. The maximum for the \"Inverted Vee\" calculator is 60MHz.\n\n▪     This calculator does not give exact measurements and the results will need to be trimmed using an antenna analyzer or SWR meter to the exact frequency after installation. Leave some extra wire on each section for trimming and wrapping around the insulators.\n\n▪     Keep in mind that there are a lot of factors that can affect the resonant frequency of an antenna.  At VHF and above even a small change in the length or diameter of an element can make a large change in the resonant frequency of an antenna even more so than at lower frequencies. This calculator just provides the starting length for building an antenna and proper matching methods will need to be used.\n\n▪     Please be safe while building your antennas. Always use the proper safety equipment. Never build your antenna where it can come in contact with power lines, this includes the supports as well as the antenna itself and feed lines. BE SAFE! \n\n▪     Although I have had good results using this calculator the results are not guaranteed. Always add some extra length and trim the antenna to frequency (it's much easier to trim than it is to add wire to the antenna). Please feel free to contact me with suggestions, problems,  compliments, ideas for improvements or additions to HamAntCal. Your ratings are appreciated."

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n• 2-finger click to open a link in a new tab\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Font replacement. Substitute one font for another on web pages, such as Helvetica for Arial and Courier for Courier New.\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

This is because the clock mechanism is influenced by temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, breeze and others environmental conditions and therefore requires frequent adjustment.\n\nWhen you are regulating the pendulum of your Cuckoo Clock today, you are attempting to achieve the best timekeeping possible by a trail and error method by lifting the pendulum bob up or down and hope for a better accuracy.\nUsing this app you can finally get a reading of your Clock ticks timing and precisely calibrate it to a known value.\n\n\nHow to calibrate your Clock using this app:\n1.\tRun this App and measure your Clock timings using the iPhone microphone\n2.\tUse the Signal Gain and the Detection Threshold sliders to adjust the measured signal\n3.\tSelect a reference timing for calibration from the clock reference table or set your own reference timing\n4.\tRead the accuracy level of your clock vs. the reference timing\n5.\tAdjust your Clock pendulum bob to get the best accuracy!\n6.     Review how many seconds/minutes your Clock will gain or lose per day based on your current calibration\n\nThe app will presents your Clock beats period reading as well as BPH (beats per hour) and BPM (beats per minutes) values.\nAn accurate waveform display of the microphone signal will help you to adjust the tick readings for the best measurement.\nAnimated Indicators will guide you through the calibration process.\n\nManage the app Reference Timings table and add user defined clocks in addition to the predefined ones to support all your clocks.\n\nThis app will turn your iPhone into a powerful measurement tool which normally costs hundreds of dollars."

      "label": "Anyone can make their own tunes in Forza. It comes down to doing the right math, taking a test drive and knowing when to make a few adjustments. Nothing magic. ForzaTune Pro does the complex math for you, and makes it easy to adjust the car to your driving style and skill.\n\nTell ForzaTune you're driving a Supra on the streets of Mexico, and it creates a tune to match. If you prefer a more aggressive or more stable feel, then open up the tune customizer to set oversteer or understeer in each part of a turn. ForzaTune works out the new values for you automatically.\n\nThere's nothing better than driving a car dialed in how you want it. And a car that feels planted lets you drive faster.\n\nThis Pro version includes many extra tuning types like rally, drag and drift plus gearing options, the ability to save tunes, and finer control over your tune balance.\n\nHere are the complete specs if you'd like to learn more:\n\nONE APP TO TUNE THEM ALL\nForzaTune Pro has support for Forza Horizon 5, Forza Horizon 4, Forza Motorsport 7 and also includes most vehicles in Forza Horizon 3 and Forza Motorsport 6.\n\nMAKE STREET, DRIFT, RALLY TUNES AND MORE\nNo matter what kind of driving you like, this tuning app has you covered. Create standard (street/track), drift, drag, rain, rally/snow, and off-road tunes with ease.\n\nLEARN HOW TO QUICKLY FINE-TUNE\nAdjust the overall balance, turn entry balance, turn exit balance, ride stiffness, roll stiffness in seconds.\n\nRETUNE GEARS WITH EASE\nIncludes a gearing calculator option that lets you match race transmission values to engine swaps or major power upgrades. \n\nTUNES ARE TAILORED TO EACH CAR\n1140+ vehicles covering Forza Horizon 5 back through Forza Motorsport 6. Tuning for some special editions (F&F, Team Forza, FE) is done with the base car unless noted otherwise. ForzaTune does not include oval racing vehicles or tuning.\n\nACCURATE FORMULAS\nForzaTune Pro combines your input with its vehicle and track databases to create original, balanced tunes. Formulas are based on real race engineering. They are also tested extensively with a gamepad and steering wheel/pedal set.\n\nSAVE AND MANAGE YOUR TUNES\nSave, edit, search and backup all of your tunes. Export and import options let you transfer your tunes to new devices or friends easily without logins or accounts.\n\n-----\nFAQs\n-----\nQ: Is this for beginners or experienced tuners?\nA: Both. Experienced tuners use it to save time. Newer tuners use it to learn how to tune.\n\nQ: How do I use the app?\nA: Copy several car details from the game into ForzaTune, hit \"Next\" and copy the results into the tuning menu in Forza Horizon 5 or an earlier Forza title. There is also a series of video tutorials on YouTube to get you started.\n\nQ: What settings and upgrades do I need?\nA: You will need racing upgrades like suspension, braking, anti-roll bars, and differential to change the values in the tuning menu. You can also use drift, rally and adjustable stock suspensions when available (like off-road buggies and some trucks in Horizon). You will also have the best results if you disable stability management (STM) and traction control (TCS) for lower class cars. Normal or simulation steering is fine, but simulation steering is recommended in FH5 especially when fine-tuning.\n\nQ: Why is tuning your cars important?\nA: When doing upgrades many of the default tune settings will not match the new build. ForzaTune brings it back to a balanced setup. Also, tuning doesn't affect your PI or race restrictions—so this is how you can gain an advantage over other racers.\n\n---\nMake better tunes faster with ForzaTune Pro."

It can be run either manually or automatically. \n\nManual mode allows you to run the test signal and flip the phase so you can listen yourself to ensure your sound system is setup correctly. \n\nAutomatic mode will run a series of test signals through your sound system and use the microphone on the device to analyse the results.\n\nNew in version 2.0 is a waveform view mode for advanced use. It allows you to play an asymmetrical waveform (ramp waveform), record the sound from each speaker close up and capture the waveforms to then compare them. \n\nPhase is a difficult concept so full help is available in the app to ensure you get the best results.\n\nYou should check the phase of your sound system whenever the wiring has been changed to ensure everything is the correct polarity.\n\nWhen a sound systems speakers are out of phase the sound quality is affected massively. Bass is reduced significantly and stereo imaging gives the illusion of the sounds pulling outside of the room.\n\nTo run the check connect your iOS device to your sound system so it can play audio. If possible place the iOS device evenly between the speakers. Phase cancellation will not occur close to the speakers so ensure the device is not too close. Ensure the volume is at a comfortable listening level and if possible ensure there is no background noise to interfere with the scan."

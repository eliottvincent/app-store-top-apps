Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n• 2-finger click to open a link in a new tab\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Font replacement. Substitute one font for another on web pages, such as Helvetica for Arial and Courier for Courier New.\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "TslaMirror for iOS \nTslaMirror is an App that will help your iPhone App mirroring to Tesla vehicle! Also, it can support App screencast to a Chrome browser.\n\nFor Tesla vehicle built-in browser\n1 Make sure the car is PARKED (0mph/0kph)! \n2 The Tesla vehicle network must be connected to the iOS device Personal Hotspot (cellular data needed) first. Tesla MCU2 hardware is needed. MCU2 is available on the Tesla Model \n3 Model Y, Model X (late than March 2018), Model S (late than March 2018), or the Tesla vehicles that are upgraded to MCU2 from MCU1.3 Start the TslaMirror App. Confirm \"Tesla Proxy\" switch is on in the TslaMirror App\n4 Click the \"Start\" button, then click \"Start Broadcast\" to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n5 Access the link http://240.3.3.3 via Tesla vehicle in-car browser\n6 Pinch the Tesla vehicle built-in browser screen to zoom in/out the picture\n7 There is no audio support for the moment. Only the App screen will be mirrored to the browser. You can use the Bluetooth audio link to the Tesla vehicle play the audio of the iOS device simultaneously during the App mirroring.\n8 Do not lock the screen. The Screen Broadcast API limitation needs the screen to keep unlocked. Once the screen is locked, Screen Broadcast needs to be restarted.\n\nFor normal desktop browser\n1 Devices are on the same Wi-Fi network\n2 Start the TslaMirror App.\n3 Click the \"Start\" button to start Screen Broadcast in the TslaMirror App\n4 Access the link below the \"Stop\" button via a normal desktop browser (Safari or Chrome)\n\nKey Features\n1 No extra internet traffic for the screencast, the App mirroring traffic is only locally on iOS device Personal Hotspot. However, please note that during the screenshot, the Tesla vehicle will use the hotspot traffic for its internet access when the hotspot is connected\n2 No extra hardware needed\n3 Private, the screencast is only available to the devices connected to the iOS Personal Hotspot Wi-Fi network\n4 Fast network\n5 5GHz Personal Hotspot(iPhone 12 series supports it) Wi-Fi is highly recommended.

All watch complication types are supported, including those really weird ones.  Also you can change the complication icon under Settings;\n7. The watch app can listen automatically on launch. There is an option under settings to do the same thing on the iPhone;\n8.

You don't have to say \"Alexa\" ... just speak your command when the app is listening;\n10.

      "label": "Anyone can make their own tunes in Forza. It comes down to doing the right math, taking a test drive and knowing when to make a few adjustments. Nothing magic. ForzaTune Pro does the complex math for you, and makes it easy to adjust the car to your driving style and skill.\n\nTell ForzaTune you're driving a Supra on the streets of Mexico, and it creates a tune to match. If you prefer a more aggressive or more stable feel, then open up the tune customizer to set oversteer or understeer in each part of a turn. ForzaTune works out the new values for you automatically.\n\nThere's nothing better than driving a car dialed in how you want it. And a car that feels planted lets you drive faster.\n\nThis Pro version includes many extra tuning types like rally, drag and drift plus gearing options, the ability to save tunes, and finer control over your tune balance.\n\nHere are the complete specs if you'd like to learn more:\n\nONE APP TO TUNE THEM ALL\nForzaTune Pro has support for Forza Horizon 5, Forza Horizon 4, Forza Motorsport 7 and also includes most vehicles in Forza Horizon 3 and Forza Motorsport 6.\n\nMAKE STREET, DRIFT, RALLY TUNES AND MORE\nNo matter what kind of driving you like, this tuning app has you covered. Create standard (street/track), drift, drag, rain, rally/snow, and off-road tunes with ease.\n\nLEARN HOW TO QUICKLY FINE-TUNE\nAdjust the overall balance, turn entry balance, turn exit balance, ride stiffness, roll stiffness in seconds.\n\nRETUNE GEARS WITH EASE\nIncludes a gearing calculator option that lets you match race transmission values to engine swaps or major power upgrades. \n\nTUNES ARE TAILORED TO EACH CAR\n1140+ vehicles covering Forza Horizon 5 back through Forza Motorsport 6. Tuning for some special editions (F&F, Team Forza, FE) is done with the base car unless noted otherwise. ForzaTune does not include oval racing vehicles or tuning.\n\nACCURATE FORMULAS\nForzaTune Pro combines your input with its vehicle and track databases to create original, balanced tunes. Formulas are based on real race engineering. They are also tested extensively with a gamepad and steering wheel/pedal set.\n\nSAVE AND MANAGE YOUR TUNES\nSave, edit, search and backup all of your tunes. Export and import options let you transfer your tunes to new devices or friends easily without logins or accounts.\n\n-----\nFAQs\n-----\nQ: Is this for beginners or experienced tuners?\nA: Both. Experienced tuners use it to save time. Newer tuners use it to learn how to tune.\n\nQ: How do I use the app?\nA: Copy several car details from the game into ForzaTune, hit \"Next\" and copy the results into the tuning menu in Forza Horizon 5 or an earlier Forza title. There is also a series of video tutorials on YouTube to get you started.\n\nQ: What settings and upgrades do I need?\nA: You will need racing upgrades like suspension, braking, anti-roll bars, and differential to change the values in the tuning menu. You can also use drift, rally and adjustable stock suspensions when available (like off-road buggies and some trucks in Horizon). You will also have the best results if you disable stability management (STM) and traction control (TCS) for lower class cars. Normal or simulation steering is fine, but simulation steering is recommended in FH5 especially when fine-tuning.\n\nQ: Why is tuning your cars important?\nA: When doing upgrades many of the default tune settings will not match the new build. ForzaTune brings it back to a balanced setup. Also, tuning doesn't affect your PI or race restrictions—so this is how you can gain an advantage over other racers.\n\n---\nMake better tunes faster with ForzaTune Pro."

      "label": "The Miracle Box is an app used for Spirit Communication and ITC Research. You must use this correctly, responsibly and by using it you are doing so at your own risk. To see the full information and Q&A on how to use this app correctly, you can visit: https://huffparanormal.com/2021/05/the-miracle-box-spirit-communication-app-is-here/\n\nThe Miracle Box includes methods used by Steve Huff of Huff Paranormal in his Astral Doorway and Miracle Box full size devices. The app has eleven banks, which are all reversed human speech. There are no words, no music, no phrases and nothing programmed in to make you think spirit is speaking with you. This is an advanced yet simple ITC app based on eleven years of research and communication. It will not work for everyone (no app or box does). \n\nWhen using it, you must do so correctly. If you do not have a connection to spirit you will not hear replies come through. Instead, you will hear gibberish, nothing. That is by design. This app is designed to only bring you true responses, if and only if you connect with a spirit when using it. No matter the app or device you use, the connection is the #1 aspect of getting results. \n\nAlways use this with love, respect, kindness and a clear mind. If you do not hear replies, try again at another time, or a different place. Do not use it if you are angry, depressed, in a negative mood or fearful of it. If you fear this, do not use this app as fear is an energy we put out that can and could attract undesirable spirits. Love is the key here and this is meant for serous ITC researchers and enthusiasts. \n\nJust pick a voice, press record, ask a question and move the slider to the right for 1-3 seconds and then slide it back. You will soon hear a voice emerge that will either be answering you (if you connected) or gibberish (if you did not). Even if you do not hear a reply in real time, always check the recording as it could have changed. \n\nThis is a tool you can grow with. To learn how to build a connection, and see demo videos with this app in action visit the Huff Paranormal YouTube Channel."

The MMO simply enters the distance and bearing to the TARGET and SOURCE from their observation position and the app calculates the rest.\n\nThis app is loaded with features to make allow to keep focused on the detection (See the user manual for a detailed description):\nFix compass bearing to animal and source by pointing device and pressing button.\nConvert binocular reticules to distance  by entering the number of reticules between horizon and animal and pressing the reticule button (per formulae in Lerczack and Hobbs, 1998).\nSet up to 3 unique observation locations to define height above sea level (required for accurate reticule conversion).\nSave data to the log for each sighting and export in .csv format for your own mapping and analyses needs.\nShows vessel position, mitigation zone and projected fauna sightings on the map. Map also displays latitude, longitude, course and speed.\nPress the radar button and the map will orientate to the vessel point of view. Sightings labels will be updated live with the distance to source and the bearing from the vessel for ease of re-sighting.\nFully customise the MMO parameters. Specify anything from your binocular MILs per reticule, mitigation zone size, choose a ramform hull as your maps ship symbol and much much more!\n\nDisclaimer:\nMMO Range Finder App should be used as a reference tool and is only as precise as the users ability to range find. Any decision making is the responsibility of the user. If in use, the compass and GPS location should be verified often."

      "label": "Octopus Watch is the easiest tool to track and stay on top of smart tariffs provided by Octopus Energy in the UK. Octopus Watch is a paymium app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch offering both a standard version and an optional subscription-only version. \n\nReady to supercharge your savings?\n\nUse the app to save big on your electricity bill, whether you are on Agile, Go, Go Faster, or Tesla tariffs. To use Octopus Watch and receive up-to-date Agile prices you only need a UK mainland postcode. For tracking of other smart tariffs (Go, Go Faster, Tesla) you need to have an Octopus Energy account. To get access to your historic usage you need to have an Octopus Energy account and an active smart meter.\n\nOctopus Watch offers full support for Agile, Go, Go Faster and Tesla import, as well as full support for Agile, SEG, fixed, and Tesla export. Octopus Watch does NOT support the Octopus Tracker tariff, Intelligent Octopus tariff, or the Powerloop tariff. Octopus Watch unofficially supports most fixed tariffs as long as you have an active smart meter. Due to a bug in Apple's Keychain the app at the moment does NOT support the Apple Watch Series 3. Support will be added again as soon as Apple fixes the Keychain bug.\n\nThe standard version gives you all the tools you need to track and stay on top of smart tariffs:\n• Immediately see the current price (also on Apple Watch!).\n• Instantly get the cheapest slot to run appliances, or charge an EV, and save big!\n• The app adjusts to the smart tariff you are on (Agile, Go, Go Faster, Tesla).\n• Easily set different appliance timers (start at, hours until start, hours until end).\n• See all upcoming rates in an easy chart and table.\n• Beautiful widget with current and upcoming prices.\n• Get a notification as soon as the next day rates are available.\n• See your historic day-by-day usage.\n• Easily compare savings against standard tariff or Agile/Go (not available if you have an export meter).\n• See how much you earned through export (only available with an export meter).\n• Various options to change the app defaults to best suit your needs!\n• Export cleaned data to CSV for easy use in other apps such as Microsoft® Excel®.\n\nWant even more? A single subscription gets you access to these amazing features:\n• Up to 48h rate predictions – better plan your usage and save more!\n• Have an export meter? Also get export rate predictions for Agile export.\n• Get an instant notification when next day prices drop below a desired threshold.\n• See the best half-hour blocks to charge an EV.\n• CO2 integration - see your environmental impact both now and in the past. \n• See the CO2 fuel composition, both as regional or national, and adjusted to your usage.\n• Get the best slot, either based on price or based on lowest CO2.\n• Day details – see your exact usage along with numerous statistics on a day-by-day basis.\n• Get half-hour details right in the app to micro-optimise your usage.\n• Create easy to read single page energy reports for any desired range over the last 4 months. \n\nThanks to Family Sharing you can install the app on all devices within the same family. Install it on your iPhone for an easy pocket reference, run it from your iPad to see the beautiful rate graph and double column table, or see the current rate with a flick of your wrist with dozens of complications to choose from. The choice is yours! Octopus Watch also supports subscription sharing, so one subscription gives you access to all the extras on all the iPhones and iPads in your household."

Get automatic reminders for individual prayers. Supports various azan alerts as well as vibration only alerts\n\n* Pre-Prayer alerts. Get reminded of the next prayer 30 minutes in advance to help you prepare\n\n* Displays prayer times for: Fajr, *Ishraaq, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha and Qiyam-ul-lail (Last 1/3rd of the night; Tahajjud Prayer)\n\n* Landscape Prayer Timetable. Turn your device landscape to see upcoming prayer times for the week / month / year. Best way to observe Ramadan monthly prayer times\n\n* Apple Watch app, as well as support for various watch-face complications. Please note: not all complications are the same. The \"InfoGraph\" watch face, for example, are limited (by watchOS) to show static information such as the next or current prayer time only.

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

Maintaining husbandry tasks, testing, stability, water changes, inhabitant stats etc. are all vital to keeping successful aquariums. \n\nPocket Marine was designed to make inputting, storing and keeping all information with you at ease. Often, any issues that we have with our aquariums can be linked to actions that were performed a short time beforehand. For this reason, a log of changes made, actions performed or additions can be vital when trying to decipher a problem that may be in play. Pen and paper has always been a great way to keep this information at hand but, Pocket Marine offers a place to store this somewhere that, this day and age, is with us at all times.\n\nNot just for tracking events. Pocket Marine is a great way to help you log your inhabitants into specific tanks, record your latest water change for your mixed reef tank or simply log your latest maintenance action performed on the fish only office tank. Recording your information couldnt be easier and keeping it on your mobile device saves on that frantic search incase of needing the information at a later date.\n\nHelp with that last second impulse buy at the store. With an in depth library of over 800 species of fish, invertebrates and coral and being added to daily, you will always have the information on hand that you need to make that informed decision on a purchase. \n\nWe hope you enjoy using the app and that we can help with your success in the hobby and welcome any feature requests you may have.\n\nHappy Reefing!"

JMRI is an interface program that works with most brands of DCC and is very popular because it simplifies DCC programming, signaling, control, and many other aspects of running a permanent layout.  It is also free and multi-platform.  \n\nInstead of direct control through the DCC system, WiThrottle links with JMRI or a dedicated module.  This provides a universal interface to many possible combinations of technology and model railroads.  As DCC evolves, JMRI is updated as needed to match current technology.\n\nJMRI Requirements:\n- JMRI 2.12 or higher, JMRI 5.0 or newer recommended\n- DCC system interfaced to a computer and a model railroad\n- Local Wi-Fi network\n\nMRC Prodigy WiFi Requirements:\n- MRC Prodigy WiFi module\n- MRC Prodigy DCC system\n\nDigitrax LnWi Requirements:\n- Digitrax LnWi module\n- Digitrax DCC system\n\nWifiTrax WFD-30/31 Requirements:\n- WifiTrax WFD module\n- NCE DCC system\n\nIf you operate at either a club or private home that uses JMRI for operations and has Wi-Fi, access to the local network (host may need to share their password) is all you need.  Multiple iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad mobile devices may use their own WiThrottle app simultaneously during an operating session.  If you would like to sample WiThrottle, we offer a Lite version at no charge.  This allows you to confirm compatibility before buying the full App.\n\nPlease visit our website for additional information.  Our goal is to enhance your model railroading experience by providing convenient, wireless control of your existing system.

Rewinder is actually a front-end for the Wayback Machine API. It uses a timeline-based design that allows you to smoothly navigate through different snapshots of a website's history. Simply scroll through the page to view past versions of a site, and tap the \"Go\" button to quickly access specific points in time.\n\nYou’re probably already familiar with Wayback Machine, so I won’t repeat its benefits here. But keep in mind that archive.org is VERY SLOW, so refresh the page if snapshots take too long (say, longer than 1 minute) to load. And avoid opening multiple archive.org pages too quickly, or you may encounter the \"429 Too Many Requests\" error.\n\nRewinder is a universal purchase, so you only need to buy it once to use it on all your Apple devices. I hope you find it useful."

      "label": "\"Low Frequency Detector\" is a new acoustic measurement tool for detecting the low frequency sound that is hard to hear in the normal situation. \n\nThe human ear is insensitive enough to become a low frequency. If you may be exposed to the noise of neighboring constructions and factories without noticing, you may have a feeling bad and a sense of oppression. In this case, you can check what type of low frequency noise exists by simple operation of this app.\n\nIn general, the low frequency sound is a sound wave with 1 Hz to 100 Hz. By depending on its frequency component and sound level, it is different the degree of influence on the human body and the noise sensation. \n\nThis app also allows you to examine the frequency component of the low frequency sounds by 1/3 octave band analysis and FFT analysis.\n\nFeatures:\n- Low frequency power level measurement less than 100Hz (LF Level):  Flat characteristic, Updating indication of measurement period 1 sec.\n- Power level measurement in the audible band (Leq): Flat characteristic, Updating indication of measurement period 200ms.\n- 1/3 octave band analysis (OCT)\n- FFT analysis (FFT)\n- Time course graph (TIME) \n- Snapshot (Snap) on the measurement display screen.\n- Report function (Report): Analysis report of a peak LF Level with TIME,  OCT and FFT.\n- Measurement time : up to 60 sec.\n\nFunctions: \nThe measurement analysis is performed in the following step. Be sure to set the measurement conditions in Step-1 once before starting the sound measurement.\n\n1) Calibration (Calibrate): A reference signal (1kHz sine wave) is output to determine the reference noise level for the low frequency component. If the volume level of iPhone is set to about 20-50%, the calibration will automatically adjust it to the optimum volume level for the reference signal.\n\n2) Measurement (Measure) : Analyze a power level of low frequency sound. \n- LF Level (dB): Low frequency power level less than 100Hz. \n- Leq (dB): Sound power level with the frequency weight characteristic Z (Flat) of the audible band.\n\n3) Measurement display: It can select either 1/3 octave band frequency analysis, FFT analysis or Time course graph. They are updated in real time.\n\n4) Report:  Measurement result report. It is effective when measuring for 10 seconds or more.\n# Time course graph : TIME\n- Low frequency (LF) Level (dB): Time course graph with peak level noise level judgment (RED-very noisy, YELLOW-noisy, GREEN-normal) at the peak level.\n- LF max (dB) : maximum dB value of low frequency.\n# Frequency response graph : OCT, FFT\n - OCT Band LF max (dB): maximum dB value in 1/3 octave band at LF max observation.\n - Max Level Frequency (Hz): peak frequency at LF max observation.\n\nNotes:\n- The sound measurement of the low frequency range is a level difference with respect to the reference signal (1kHz sine wave), which indicates the relative power level. \n- The reference signal is output during calibration and sound level measurement.\n- Do not change the volume level of iPhone after the calibration. \n- White line in the OCT and FFT modes indicates frequency characteristics in frequency weight correction of G characteristics.\n- Since iPhone's built-in microphone has a lower sensitivity on the very low frequency range, it is not recommended to measure a huge volume sound near a very loud noise source.\n- Since it takes a while for the observation value to stabilize immediately after the start of measurement, the maximum value is calculated from about 2 seconds later.\n- In the case high power of 1kHz component is included in the measured noise source, the precision of measured value by this app largely decreases. \n- Sudden noise or impulsive sounds are not low frequency noises in general.\n- The previous calibration information can be maintained internally.\n- The analysis results may vary due to individual differences in iPhone devices.\n- The authorization to access built-in microphone and Photos will be confirmed by iOS system at first boot."

      "label": "iCab Mobile is a web browser for the iOS. It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nAPPLE WATCH:\nThe Watch App is a remote control for iCab Mobile, so you can navigate, zoom, scroll, open bookmarks, links, the homepage, switch tabs or sitch on/off the fullscreen mode. Since watchOS 6.2 you can also open web pages and browse the Web directly on the Apple Watch. But there are still limitations: there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders. You can import/export the bookmarks from/to your PC/Mac browser. \n\nFULLSCREEN MODE:\niCab Mobile provides a fullscreen mode where the whole screen is used to display the web page. No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

There's no limit on how many contacts you can lock.\n\nWe all have a few contacts in our iPhone for people we really should NOT phone or email at 1am on a Friday night (your ex-girl/boy friend, your mother(!) or your boss).\n\nWith Drunk Dial NO! you can leave your house at 8pm on a Friday night, hide those contacts for 12 hours and stop yourself waking up on Saturday morning thinking (cleaned up for iTunes!) \"Oh dear! oh my! I didn't, did I??!\"\n\nNEW FEATURE: Drunk Dial NO! now blocks incoming numbers for the time you set! Make sure that annoying ex-boyfriend doesn't try to call you when you're out on the town. Make sure your boss doesn't call and hear you drunk! Awesomely useful!\n\nNEW FEATURE: Send yourself a message upto 48 hours into the future! Warn your future, drunken, self against making a dreadful mistake! (you know the kind of thing we're talking about!)\n\n- Now looks great on Retina displays \n\n- Have Fun (and don't worry)\n\n----------------\nReal User Reviews:\n\nDrunk and call!! - 5 Stars\nby LISA705 - Version 2.995 - Nov 23, 2012\nI like it, it saves me alot!\n\nIt works!! - 4 Stars\nby me - Version 2.80 - Dec 27, 2011\nThis app is ridiculously funny!

This is gonna be awesome for upcoming nights.\n\nThe Best! - 5 Stars\nby ksierra123 - Version 1.20 - May 29 2009\nThis is the best app ever! Thank you for saving me from myself!\n\nPerfect App - 5 Stars\nby Jenniferw83 - Version 2.00 - May 29 2010\nThis app is perfect, and not just for when you are drunk. It's good to keep me from calling or texting an ex right after we break up. Every time I get the urge to text just cause I put his number on drunk dial no for 48 hours and by the time the 48 hours goes by the urge is gone. If not then I put him on it for another 48 hours!\n----------------\n\nTO START:\n - Tap the '+' button\n - Choose one of your contacts\n - Drunk Dial NO! will store the contact's phone number(s) and email address(es) for between 1 and 48 hours\n - NO EXCUSES! NO BEGGING!\n - After between 1 and 48 hours, run Drunk Dial NO! again to restore stored contact(s)\n\nTO TEST:\n - Create a contact called 'Test Person'\n   (first name: Test, last name: Person)\n - Add some fake phone and email entries for 'Test Person'\n - Choose 'Test Person' contact in Drunk Dial NO!\n - 'Test Person' is only stored for 5 minutes\n\nTO SEND YOURSELF A MESSAGE:\n - Tap the Compose button\n - Enter an important message you don't want to forget\n - The message will be sent to your device after the number of hours you enter\n\nTO TURN ON INCOMING BLOCKING:\n - In the Settings App\n - Goto Phone > Call Blocking & Identification\n - Make sure Drunk Dial NO! is turned On\n\nNote: If you've got contacts which Drunk Dial NO! is blocking, don't delete Drunk Dial NO! until you've restored the contacts using Drunk Dial NO! (of course, hopefully you'll like Drunk Dial NO! so much that you won't delete it!)\n\nFollow us on twitter @explorefun\n\nAll comments/suggestions welcomed to: info@explorefun.com"

      "label": "Know if someone unlocked your screen and is spying on your device! True security against physical access. It works if they know your password and even if no password is set for the lock-screen.\niAmNotified is the solution to definitively secure your device! \nIt acts as a watchdog that lets you know if someone accessed your iPhone or iPad while you were not looking. It can also alert people that you are monitoring the device, discouraging any malicious access.  \n\nNo one can access your device without the password. But...\n\nWhat happens if your sneaky colleague or friend peeks while you type it in? \nWhat if your partner or parents simply demand it? (\"Why don't you give me your password, are you hiding something?\".... does this sound familiar?). \nWhat if someone uses your fingerprint to unlock your device while you sleep? (yeah, it has happened, check the press).\n\nThey would have access to your entire life: pictures, videos, contacts, whatsapp conversations, facebook chats, emails (which mean access to any of your online accounts via password reset), etc.\nThey might even install malware to spy on you remotely!\n\nTHE WORST PART IS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE. \nThat you need to change your password. That a tracking virus is running on your device. That you have to alert your bank. That your competitor has stolen your confidential data.  That your partner knows about \"those\" pictures and conversations and you'd better prepare a good excuse....\nThat people you trust don't respect your privacy!\n\n\n+++ HOW IT WORKS +++\n! THE SIMPLEST APP EVER !\n1. open the App\n2. lock the screen\n\nThat's it! Your device is Secured!\n\nYou will immediately receive a notification on the lock-screen. The notification will remain there until the screen stays locked. If anyone unlocks the screen while you are away, the notification will not be there when you return, alerting you that someone had access to your device.\nThe notification changes every single time for extra security.\n\nThe History Log keeps track of the last notifications shown, so by-passing the system is virtually impossible. \n\n+++FEATURES +++\nDouble Function: use the app with STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS to catch anyone who is spying on you, or with DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS to let everybody know that you are monitoring any access to the device.\n\nYou choose what appears on the notification: \n\n+ STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS (simulate a useful notification, to disguise the true nature of iAmNotified)\n- Lucky Lottery Numbers - [Who doesn't play the lottery?  I mean... free money, right?!]\n- Famous Citations - [Because everyone needs some inspirational quotes every now and then]\n- Definition of a Complex Word - [Education is important! Anyone would want to expand his vocabulary]\n- Fake Stock Exchange Alert - [These are total random companies symbols and values. Not real data to be sued in the stock market!]\n\n+ DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS (showing that you are monitoring the device, will discourage people from accessing it)\n- Custom Message - [You choose what appears on the notification]\n- \"Device locked at: #current date and time#\" - [Shows the time of the last screen lock]\n- \"Access to this device is monitored. Unique notification ID: #securityID#\" \n\n*** PRO OPTIONS ***\nImprove your stealthiness with these advanced options\n\n- Secret Lock -> Launch iAmNotified without anyone near you noticing. When the option is activated, a black dimmed screen is shown when the app is opened, simulating the lock screen. Now you can secretly press the lock button to lock the screen, or wait for it to lock automatically. To access the app with the option activated, simply tap anywhere on the black screen.\n\n- Random Notification Time -> The notification appears at a random time within 2 minutes from the screen lock, instead of immediately after\n\nStart to feel in control of your device!"

The front-facing camera will use the infrared sensor in the TrueDepth camera. The rear-facing camera will use the new LiDAR sensor. The LiDAR & Infrared Night Vision app turns the world around you into a depth map, where different colors represent distances from your device.\n\nSCARE YOUR FRIENDS \nTrigger scare-mode and set your friends up for a huge scream.\n\nFor best results, be in complete darkness in a room with space behind you. Explain to your friends how the cool new app shows things around the room you can’t see with the naked eye. Make sure your friend’s face is on the screen, and after 30 seconds, a jump-scare flashes on screen, and captures the terrified face.  \n\nAPPLICATIONS\nSee in the dark without turning on your flashlight\nShow off your new phone capabilities\nScare Your Friends\nMake Your Friends Cry\nShare your friend’s terror with a captured picture or video.\nExplore how LiDAR and infrared technology works\nLearn about depth maps and seeing without light\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nUnlike a regular camera, LiDAR and infrared sensors do not need ambient light.  They both generate their own light, which you cannot see. Therefore, both sensors will work in complete darkness.\n\nOTHER DEVICES\nThis app will work on devices that don’t have LiDAR. It will use the front TrueDepth camera to provide a depth map of yourself and objects behind you.

      "label": "Take the guess work out of aligning any TV antenna. Within seconds Antenna Mate will accurately* point to the direction of your best** TV reception from anywhere in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. Antenna Mate is used by professional installers, caravaners, and DIYers from city and country areas.\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n* 1,151 broadcasting sites.\n* 3,698 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands where digital terrestrial television is available*****\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN AUSTRALIA\n\n* 597 broadcasting sites.\n* 2,841 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in QLD, NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, SA, WA and NT where digital terrestrial television is available***\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN NEW ZEALAND\n\n* 35 broadcasting sites.\n* 344 transmitters\n* All cities and towns in the North and South Islands where digital terrestrial television is available****\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nUsing your current location, your device's compass, and the target site's effective radiated power, Antenna Mate instantly estimates the signal strength of all nearby sites and automatically plots a bearing to the best one**.\n\nUnder normal circumstances you should get an initial result within seconds. The longer you leave Antenna Mate open, the more accurate it will become. For best results use Antenna Mate outside in an open space and away from objects which cause interference.\n\nAntenna Mate doesn't need an internet connection, that's one of the reasons why it's so fast.\n\nDETAILED TRANSMITTER INFO\n\nComplete listings of all digital terrestrial transmitters are available at each site. Listings include the callsign, frequency (MHz), channel, polarisation, and effective radiated power (kW).\n\nALL SITES BY STRENGTH OR DISTANCE\n\nPrefer to align your TV antenna with another broadcasting site? No worries! Sites can be listed from strongest to weakest, or closest to furthest away. Pick any site from the list and Antenna Mate instantly plots a new bearing to the targeted site.\n\nUsing an amplifier or high gain antenna? You can increase the search radius up to 200 km (120 mi) from your current location.\n\nLIGHT AND DARK DISPLAY SWITCHING\n\nWhen your device is in direct sunlight Antenna Mate will automatically switch to a light display making the arrow easy to see. Perfect for performing an alignment during the middle of the day.\n\nUSE IT UPSIDE DOWN, OR THE RIGHT WAY UP\n\nAntenna Mate is smart enough to know when your device is being held upside down, or the right way up. Either way, it will always point to the targeted site.\n\nSUPPORT AND FEEDBACK\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback or help you troubleshoot. Send an e-mail to support@antennamate.com or tweet @antennamate. Follow us on Twitter to get notified when transmitter data is updated.\n\n* Time taken to find best broadcasting site and directional accuracy will vary based on device and external environmental factors.\n\n** Best broadcasting site is measured by estimating maximum theoretical field strength in free space (No obstructions or reflections). Actual field strength will be lower. Closest broadcasting site is measured by estimating distance using line of sight. Distance is only an approximation.\n\n*** Based on Australian Communications and Media Authority data.\n\n**** Based on Radio Spectrum Management and OpenStreetMap data.\n\n***** Based on Ofcom data."

      "label": "iNet - explore your network!\nFind out about security risks and keep your network under control. Which devices are connected to my network? Are they online? Which services do they provide? Does somebody use my wifi network without my knowledge? These and other questions answers iNet fast and simple.\n\nWith iNet you know exactly what's going on! This easy to use App outlines a computer network even to the unexperienced user. And iNet never phones home, your data is absolutely private on your iPhone.\n\niNet provides you with information about networks your iPhone or iPod touch is connected to. Its very easy and user friendly design even allows the unexperienced user to get a profound and understandable overview of a network and the running services.\n\nIn the current release of iNet we implemented the following features:\n\n    • Network scan\n    • Ping\n    • Bonjour browser\n    • Portscan\n    • Device info\n    • Wake on Lan\n    • Sleep on Lan (Macintosh only)\n    • Extensive help section\n    • Send scan results via email\n\nScan Network:\niNet shows the devices connected to your local network, e. g. a computer or router, along with their name, IP and vendor. iNet discovers and distinguishes between windows and macintosh computers with different icons. For most Apple Computers the particular computer model can be seen. Find out the name, vendor and IP of the connected devices as well as the number of running Bonjour services on that particular device. (MAC and Vendor cannot be detected anymore since iOS 11) A classic portscan on the choosen device can also be performed.\n\nThe technology used in iNet scans on a very low level, therefore one can even find machines that don't want to be found, for instance a Mac OS X computer running in stealth mode.\n\nPing:\nPing is a computer network tool used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network or not. The ping section in iNet enables you to find out if an IP exists (if its ping service is enabled; otherwise you will get no response :-)). For your convenience we added a bookmark function to store often needed addresses.\n\nBonjour browser:\nBonjour, also known as zero-configuration networking, enables automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. Bonjour uses industry standard IP protocols to allow devices to automatically discover each other without the need to enter IP addresses or configure DNS servers. The Bonjour-Browser in iNet scans the connected local network for Bonjour services, detecting any hardware that ist connected via the Bonjour protocol (for instance computer, router, printer, …) and any software running Bonjour services, e. g. iTunes or Filemaker.\n\nWake on lan:\nThe outstanding feature of our implementation is that it is very easy to use and simple to setup. For more information see iNet WOL, our stand-alone tool for WOL.\n\nPortscan:\nApplications on devices communicate with the outside world through so called TCP ports. iNet detects wether a port is open or closed. For all detected open ports the service using this port is displayed by its real name (if available).\n\nDevice Info: \nThe device info in iNet shows some information related to your iPhone or iPod touch, e. g. its name or its IP.\n\nFuture:\nThe modularisized structure of iNet allows to add more features and scanning methods in the future. We will implement by time more network monitoring tools, e. g. DNS-Querys, Traceroute, Whois lookup etc.. iNet Pro will be updated on a regular basis as before. In addition we released iNet for Mac in December 2010 - available via the App Store.\n\nIf you want to know what's going on in your local network - iNet Networks Scanner gives you a profound answer.\n\nP.s.: In case you need just the network scan feature of iNet Pro, use the free version iNet - Network Scanner.  You can always update to iNet Pro from within iNet to access its full feature set. \n\nP.p.s: iNet never \"phones home\"!"

This cuts the blue light and makes it easier to sleep.\n\nThe second slider is where you set the fade out time, from 1-60 mins.\n\nThe third slider shows how much time is remaining and will gradually move to zero after you hit start.\n\nWhen you hit start, the controls will dim and only the Time Remaining slider will be visible. This allows you to quickly turn up the brightness if you need to see, or if you want to give more time until it's dark.\n\nWhile the timer is running, the device will be prevented from sleeping.\nOnce the timer is finished and the screen is dark, the device will be allowed to auto-lock to save battery."

      "label": "\"Decibel X\" is the leading noise meter app on the market, which has highly reliable, pre-calibrated measurements and supports dBA, dBC. Our success lies at the intersection of expertise in sound communication, listening to our dear users, and our vision to build a great product. Our app turns your iOS device into a professional sound level meter, precisely measures the sound pressure level (SPL) all around you. While this pro tool mainly aids audio experts or workers prone to noise pollution, it can also add more fun and protect your hearing. Have you ever wondered how quiet your surroundings are or how loud is a rock concert or football match? \"Decibel X\" will help you answer all of those.\n\nWHAT MAKE IT GREAT AND STAND OUT FROM OTHER APPS:\n\n- Trusted accuracy: the app is tested and pre calibrated for all Apple devices. The precision is matching with real SPL devices\n- Apple Watch support: see noise level right from your wrist\n- Health App integration: export noise levels directly into Health app.\n- Frequency weighting filters: ITU-R 468, A, B, C, Z\n- Powerful, smart history data management:\n  + Recording data can be saved into a list of history records for future access and analysis\n  + Each record can be exported as hi-res PNG graph or CSV text via sharing services\n  + iCloud support which synchronize all history records across your Apple devices\n  + Fullscreen mode to give overview the whole history of an record\n- Dosimeter with NIOSH, OSHA standards\n- FFT and BAR graphs to display real time FFT. Those are very useful for frequency analysis and musical tests. Real time predominant frequency is also displayed.\n- WAVE graph with 2 display modes: Rolling & Buffer\n- InstaDecibel to capture your dB report overlaid on photos and easily shared via popular social networks (Facebook, Instagram, Messages, etc.).\n- Support both Portrait and Landscape layouts\n- Beautiful, intuitive and carefully crafted UI design\n- Optimized for iOS 11\n\nOTHER GREAT FEATURES:\n\n- Standard time weightings (Response Time): SLOW (500 milliseconds) and FAST (200 milliseconds)\n- Trimming calibration from -15 dB to 15 dB\n- Standard measurement range from 30 dBA up to 130 dBA\n- HISTO graph for plotted history of the recorded values\n- Real time scale level chart\n- Display Current, Average/Leq, and Max values with both nice and clear digital and analog layouts\n- Quick reference text to help you compare with real-life examples\n- \"Keep Device Stay Awake\" option for long duration recording\n- Reset and clear current recording at any time\n- Tap on Max value to reset at any time\n- Pause/Resume the tool at any time\n\nNOTES:\n\n- Please do not expect a quiet room reading will be 0 dBA. The range 30-130 dBA is the standard usable range and an average quiet room will be about 30 dBA.\n- Although all devices are pre-calibrated, custom calibration is suggested for serious purposes requiring higher precision and accuracy. You will need a real external device or calibrated sound meter as a reference, then adjust the trimming calibration until the reading matches with the reference.\n\n* Choose from different subscription options.

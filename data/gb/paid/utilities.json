Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation."

      "label": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

      "label": "StopTheMadness is a Safari extension that stops web sites from making your browser harder to use. And it protects your privacy on the web. StopTheMadness is not an ad blocker: it offers unique features not available from ad blockers or any other apps. StopTheMadness is one of a kind!\n\nMade by indie developer Jeff Johnson. The support link has documentation and my email address.\n\nMany web sites deliberately disable user interface features in Safari that you normally expect to work. StopTheMadness re-enables those features for you in Safari:\n• opening contextual menus\n• selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting of text\n• drag and drop\n• AutoFill/autocomplete of passwords, emails, etc.\n\nStopTheMadness also protects your privacy on the web:\n• Stops Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)! Automatically loads the original \"canonical\" web site page instead of Google AMP.\n• Removes tracking tags such as utm_source, gclid, and fbclid from the end of URLs.\n• Stops clickjacking in Google Search, Gmail, Facebook, and DuckDuckGo.\n• Stops hyperlink auditing (anchor \"ping\").\n• Stops tracking beacons (Navigator.sendBeacon).\n• Stops sites from using the Page Visibility API to know when a tab is visible on your screen.\n• Stops URL shorteners. Checks the links you click in Safari for well-known link shorteners — bit.ly, tinyurl.com, l.facebook.com, t.co, etc. — and loads the unshortened destination URL instead of the shortened URL. This occurs without setting any cookies or other site data, so you can't be tracked by your click.\n\nBonus Features:\n• Stop videos from autoplaying. This works even on sites where Safari doesn't stop autoplay, such as YouTube. And YouTube video ads are automatically skipped! Also stops videos from following you down the page when you scroll on many sites.\n• Stop sites in Safari from pausing your audio in a background app such as Apple Music.\n• Show native video controls. Use Picture-in-Picture from Safari on sites that don't normally support it, including YouTube!\n• Automatically select the highest video quality on YouTube!\n• Hides the annoying popup banners prompting you to get the app on Google, Google Maps, DuckDuckGo, IMDb, Instagram, Quora, Reddit, and Tumblr!\n• Add your own site-specific CSS and JavaScript to web pages!\n• Custom URL redirects! Redirect new Reddit to old Reddit, Twitter to Nitter, YouTube to Invidious, etc. You can create any redirect that you want!\n• Stop keyboard page zoom. Stops the page from zooming in when you show the software keyboard!\n• Enable pinch-to-zoom on sites that prevent it, such as old reddit.\n• Stops \"Are you sure you want to leave this page?\" alerts. Close your tabs without getting stopped by the site!\n• Force external links to open in the current tab instead of a new tab. Remove target=\"_blank\" from links so that they no longer automatically create a new tab.\n• Force external links to open in a new tab instead of the current tab. This is great if you're scrolling through a list of links and want to open each one in a new tab.\n• Force images to the front. Bypass the transparent overlay on sites such as Instagram that prevents you from dragging and opening the contextual menu on images.\n• Warns when you paste or type beyond the maximum length in a password field or other text field. Stops you from accidentally losing characters!"

All watch complication types are supported, including those really weird ones.  Also you can change the complication icon under Settings;\n7. The watch app can listen automatically on launch. There is an option under settings to do the same thing on the iPhone;\n8. If the weather or time are wrong, ensure you've enabled Location access in the Alexa app to the \"Voice in a Can\" device, and that you have granted Location permissions to the app on your phone;\n9. You don't have to say \"Alexa\" ... just speak your command when the app is listening;\n10. You can change the language that you speak and hear responses in, under \"Settings\" on the watch and phone.  Only languages supported by Alexa are supported. The language should be set automatically.\n\nIf you have questions or any support issues please don't hesitate to email damian@voiceinacan.com ... you should get a response within 24 hours, and often in minutes.\n\nThis app was not created or endorsed by Amazon.

      "label": "The Miracle Box is an app used for Spirit Communication and ITC Research. You must use this correctly, responsibly and by using it you are doing so at your own risk. To see the full information and Q&A on how to use this app correctly, you can visit: https://huffparanormal.com/2021/05/the-miracle-box-spirit-communication-app-is-here/\n\nThe Miracle Box includes methods used by Steve Huff of Huff Paranormal in his Astral Doorway and Miracle Box full size devices. The app has eleven banks, which are all reversed human speech. There are no words, no music, no phrases and nothing programmed in to make you think spirit is speaking with you. This is an advanced yet simple ITC app based on eleven years of research and communication. It will not work for everyone (no app or box does). \n\nWhen using it, you must do so correctly. If you do not have a connection to spirit you will not hear replies come through. Instead, you will hear gibberish, nothing. That is by design. This app is designed to only bring you true responses, if and only if you connect with a spirit when using it. No matter the app or device you use, the connection is the #1 aspect of getting results. \n\nAlways use this with love, respect, kindness and a clear mind. If you do not hear replies, try again at another time, or a different place. Do not use it if you are angry, depressed, in a negative mood or fearful of it. If you fear this, do not use this app as fear is an energy we put out that can and could attract undesirable spirits. Love is the key here and this is meant for serous ITC researchers and enthusiasts. \n\nJust pick a voice, press record, ask a question and move the slider to the right for 1-3 seconds and then slide it back. You will soon hear a voice emerge that will either be answering you (if you connected) or gibberish (if you did not). Even if you do not hear a reply in real time, always check the recording as it could have changed. \n\nThis is a tool you can grow with. To learn how to build a connection, and see demo videos with this app in action visit the Huff Paranormal YouTube Channel."

      "label": "Convenience on the wrist - Watch app for Tesla is the ideal companion in day to day life with your Tesla vehicle. These are just a few of the day to day conveniences this app will help achieve:\n\n - Forgot to plug in? Get a notification if vehicle is in a pre-configured location and not plugged in - all done directly on the watch, no external servers required, keeping your privacy!\n\n - Add the graphic corner complication to your watch face and enjoy the convenience of having easy access to state of charge, charging indicator, time remaining if charging, sentry mode active indicator and indicator if any windows, doors or trunks are open. All from one complication, that also will launch the app when tapped. \n\n - During and after charge, a panel will show how much energy was added. Convenient if you schedule your charge during the night - wake up each morning and easily check how much energy was added to the battery. \n\n - If you have multiple vehicles on your account, tap the vehicle name to quickly and easily switch between them. \n\n - You can queue up commands by tapping on buttons, then put your wrist down and the commands will execute in the background when the vehicle is successfully woken up. \n\n - When you tap the unlock vehicle button, the charge port will also unlock if a charging cable is attached. That's convenience right there!\n\n - Want to reduce phantom drain? Background updates can be configured to longer intervals between updates or to only update if car is already awake or can be disabled entirely for absolutely zero impact on phantom drain.\n\n - A warning panel will show up if any doors, windows or trunks are left open. Conveniently, you can tap the panel to close any open windows.\n\n - Need to access the frunk? Just do it from your wrist - no fiddling with your phone. \n\n - Sitting comfy in the couch, but just remembered you have a road-trip in the morning? Set the charge limit to 100% - or any value really - and start charging, right from the convenience of your wrist!\n\n - Leaving the office after a long hot day? Activate the HVAC when you're on your way, and enjoy a nice cool vehicle.\n\n - When charging, tap the time remaining label to switch to show time of expected completion - no more head calculus!\n\n - Need to run a quick errand, but you don't have your phone? Unlock your vehicle from your wrist, then activate remote start and off you go. Just please be mindful that this feature requires internet connectivity on both watch and vehicle - so don't drive into the desert and leave your vehicle, or you'll get stuck there!\n\nA note about security and privacy:\nThis app accepts two types of login. Either Tesla account credentials or a Tesla API token. Your account credentials are by default not stored in the app, but are used only once to obtain an authentication token and refresh token directly from the Tesla API server. If you would rather supply that token yourself, you can do so instead. It is preferable to supply a refresh token, as the app will then have a perpetual login. Your token will be persisted in the app. Tokens will be revoked if you change your Tesla account password. With the optional remote start feature you can choose to store your password in the app - it will be securely stored in the iOS / watchOS / iPadOS keychain. This feature is optional and is not required for all other features to function. No network traffic will ever be emitted from this app that goes anywhere other than directly to the Tesla API servers. The source code for this application will at all times be made available to any security researcher for a voluntary security and safety audit. \n\nDisclaimer: \nThis app is not endorsed by Tesla Inc. Use at your own risk. No guarantee of proper function is given. Only you are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.  \n\nMade in Denmark"

      "label": "iNet - explore your network!\nFind out about security risks and keep your network under control. Which devices are connected to my network? Are they online? Which services do they provide? Does somebody use my wifi network without my knowledge? These and other questions answers iNet fast and simple.\n\nWith iNet you know exactly what's going on! This easy to use App outlines a computer network even to the unexperienced user. And iNet never phones home, your data is absolutely private on your iPhone.\n\niNet provides you with information about networks your iPhone or iPod touch is connected to. Its very easy and user friendly design even allows the unexperienced user to get a profound and understandable overview of a network and the running services.\n\nIn the current release of iNet we implemented the following features:\n\n    • Network scan\n    • Ping\n    • Bonjour browser\n    • Portscan\n    • Device info\n    • Wake on Lan\n    • Sleep on Lan (Macintosh only)\n    • Extensive help section\n    • Send scan results via email\n\nScan Network:\niNet shows the devices connected to your local network, e. g. a computer or router, along with their name, IP and vendor. iNet discovers and distinguishes between windows and macintosh computers with different icons. For most Apple Computers the particular computer model can be seen. Find out the name, vendor and IP of the connected devices as well as the number of running Bonjour services on that particular device. (MAC and Vendor cannot be detected anymore since iOS 11) A classic portscan on the choosen device can also be performed.\n\nThe technology used in iNet scans on a very low level, therefore one can even find machines that don't want to be found, for instance a Mac OS X computer running in stealth mode.\n\nPing:\nPing is a computer network tool used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network or not. The ping section in iNet enables you to find out if an IP exists (if its ping service is enabled; otherwise you will get no response :-)). For your convenience we added a bookmark function to store often needed addresses.\n\nBonjour browser:\nBonjour, also known as zero-configuration networking, enables automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. Bonjour uses industry standard IP protocols to allow devices to automatically discover each other without the need to enter IP addresses or configure DNS servers. The Bonjour-Browser in iNet scans the connected local network for Bonjour services, detecting any hardware that ist connected via the Bonjour protocol (for instance computer, router, printer, …) and any software running Bonjour services, e. g. iTunes or Filemaker.\n\nWake on lan:\nThe outstanding feature of our implementation is that it is very easy to use and simple to setup. For more information see iNet WOL, our stand-alone tool for WOL.\n\nPortscan:\nApplications on devices communicate with the outside world through so called TCP ports. iNet detects wether a port is open or closed. For all detected open ports the service using this port is displayed by its real name (if available).\n\nDevice Info: \nThe device info in iNet shows some information related to your iPhone or iPod touch, e. g. its name or its IP.\n\nFuture:\nThe modularisized structure of iNet allows to add more features and scanning methods in the future. We will implement by time more network monitoring tools, e. g. DNS-Querys, Traceroute, Whois lookup etc.. iNet Pro will be updated on a regular basis as before. In addition we released iNet for Mac in December 2010 - available via the App Store.\n\nIf you want to know what's going on in your local network - iNet Networks Scanner gives you a profound answer.\n\nP.s.: In case you need just the network scan feature of iNet Pro, use the free version iNet - Network Scanner.  You can always update to iNet Pro from within iNet to access its full feature set. \n\nP.p.s: iNet never \"phones home\"!"

      "label": "Octopus Watch is the easiest tool to track and stay on top of smart tariffs provided by Octopus Energy in the UK. Octopus Watch is a paymium app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch offering both a standard version and an optional subscription-only version. \n\nReady to supercharge your savings?\n\nUse the app to save big on your electricity bill, whether you are on Agile, Go, Go Faster, or Tesla tariffs. To use Octopus Watch and receive up-to-date Agile prices you only need a UK mainland postcode. For tracking of other smart tariffs (Go, Go Faster, Tesla) you need to have an Octopus Energy account. To get access to your historic usage you need to have an Octopus Energy account and an active smart meter.\n\nOctopus Watch offers full support for Agile, Go, Go Faster and Tesla import, as well as full support for Agile, SEG, fixed, and Tesla export. Octopus Watch does NOT support the Octopus Tracker tariff, Intelligent Octopus tariff, or the Powerloop tariff. Octopus Watch unofficially supports most fixed tariffs as long as you have an active smart meter. Due to a bug in Apple's Keychain the app at the moment does NOT support the Apple Watch Series 3. Support will be added again as soon as Apple fixes the Keychain bug.\n\nThe standard version gives you all the tools you need to track and stay on top of smart tariffs:\n• Immediately see the current price (also on Apple Watch!).\n• Instantly get the cheapest slot to run appliances, or charge an EV, and save big!\n• The app adjusts to the smart tariff you are on (Agile, Go, Go Faster, Tesla).\n• Easily set different appliance timers (start at, hours until start, hours until end).\n• See all upcoming rates in an easy chart and table.\n• Beautiful widget with current and upcoming prices.\n• Get a notification as soon as the next day rates are available.\n• See your historic day-by-day usage.\n• Easily compare savings against standard tariff or Agile/Go (not available if you have an export meter).\n• See how much you earned through export (only available with an export meter).\n• Various options to change the app defaults to best suit your needs!\n• Export cleaned data to CSV for easy use in other apps such as Microsoft® Excel®.\n\nWant even more? A single subscription gets you access to these amazing features:\n• Up to 48h rate predictions – better plan your usage and save more!\n• Have an export meter? Also get export rate predictions for Agile export.\n• Get an instant notification when next day prices drop below a desired threshold.\n• See the best half-hour blocks to charge an EV.\n• CO2 integration - see your environmental impact both now and in the past. \n• See the CO2 fuel composition, both as regional or national, and adjusted to your usage.\n• Get the best slot, either based on price or based on lowest CO2.\n• Day details – see your exact usage along with numerous statistics on a day-by-day basis.\n• Get half-hour details right in the app to micro-optimise your usage.\n• Create easy to read single page energy reports for any desired range over the last 4 months. \n\nThanks to Family Sharing you can install the app on all devices within the same family. Install it on your iPhone for an easy pocket reference, run it from your iPad to see the beautiful rate graph and double column table, or see the current rate with a flick of your wrist with dozens of complications to choose from. The choice is yours! Octopus Watch also supports subscription sharing, so one subscription gives you access to all the extras on all the iPhones and iPads in your household."

      "label": "\"Mosquitone Detector\" is a sound measurement app that detects high frequency noises and ultrasonic sounds hard to hear for human ears.\n\nIt may have been exposed to artificial high-frequency noise while you do not notice. This app can detect and visualize such high-frequency noises.\n \nIn general, the human audible range is said to be 20 Hz to 20 kHz, but very high frequency sounds above 10kHz will gradually become difficult to hear with age.\n\nFor example, there are increasing cases where high-frequency noise generators are installed in various places as a purpose of repelling young people and beast pests using very high frequency mosquito noises that can not be heard by general adults.\n\nEspecially for young children, there are cases that they stay in the bad place even though on a very uncomfortable noise environment because adults can not recognize at all.\nPlease use this app to find high frequency noise, so it will help you to quickly get away from the bad spot or remove the noise source.\n\nThis app has two operation modes, \"Detect\" and \"Search\". \"Detect\" can check if there are high frequency and ultrasonic sounds that you can not hear. \"Search\" can find the direction of high-frequency sound source. It can only be used when it has found the peak frequency in \"Detect\".\n\nFeatures:\n- Detection of high frequency sound and ultrasonic wave, and display the peak frequency of the highest level.\n- Search for sound source direction: 360 degrees horizontally\n- Detectable frequency range: 8kHz - 16kHz / 16KHz - 23kHz (2 band division)\n- Function to switch the gain range: 0 - 100dB / -10 - 90dB / -20 - 80dB (in Detect mode)\n\nOperating procedure:\n1) Selection of detectable frequency band\nSelect the frequency band as more than 16kHz or less than 16kHz.\n\n2) Selection of Operational mode\n- Detect mode \nIt finds an inaudible high frequency and ultrasonic sound in the frequency band more than 16 kHz (or less than 16 kHz).\nTap START button and it starts the detection function. If high frequency or ultrasonic sound exist, it will be displayed on the graph as the peak frequency. You can make the graph display easier to see by switching the gain range.\n\n- Search mode\nIt finds the direction of occurrence of the high-frequency sound source that detected the peak frequency. “Search” can be used only when high frequency or ultrasonic sound is founded in “Detect\". \nPlease make sure to hold the bottom built-in microphone of iPhone so that it faces outward. If you measure with the microphone facing inward, microphone sensitivity will deteriorate and accurate measurement will not be possible.\nTap Start button, and firmly hold the iPhone terminal, please turn slowly clockwise. Recommended that the time required for a rotation is about 15 seconds and the rotation speed in the graph is approximately 4 rpm.\nThe measurement is completed by one revolution, and the signal strength of the peak frequency is displayed on the pie chart. You can find approximate direction of the high-frequency sound source relative to your standing position.\n\n3) Snapshot\nTap SNAP button, you can save the measurement result as “Photos” as an image file. A timestamp is inserted in the image.\n\nNote:\nIf the frequency changes periodically or randomly, it is not possible to determine the direction of occurrence in \"Search\".\nUltrasonic measurement depends on the sensitivity characteristics of the built-in microphone, so the measurement result may vary.\n\nRemarks:\nIt is still under study about health effects on human body by listening to high-frequencies including ultrasonic sound. If the high frequency noise of high level is detected daily, we recommend that you consult an expert.\n\nPlease visit our iOS App Support page for more information on this app."

      "label": "iCab Mobile is a web browser for the iOS. It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nAPPLE WATCH:\nThe Watch App is a remote control for iCab Mobile, so you can navigate, zoom, scroll, open bookmarks, links, the homepage, switch tabs or sitch on/off the fullscreen mode. Since watchOS 6.2 you can also open web pages and browse the Web directly on the Apple Watch. But there are a few limitations: The watchOS will always show a privacy warning when starting a browsing session and there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders. You can import/export the bookmarks from/to your PC/Mac browser. \n\nFULLSCREEN MODE:\niCab Mobile provides a fullscreen mode where the whole screen is used to display the web page. No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

If you want to spread the fish or tripe quantities across several days, it can do that too.\nOne, two or more meals a day ? You got it.\nSeveral pets ?

Using iTunes on a Mac, simply connect your iPhone, and drag-and-drop the new ringtone file to \"On My Device\".\n\nThis app allows pasting your new Morse Code ringtone sound directly into an iOS GarageBand track, thus allowing one to create a ringtone directly on a iOS device, without having to Sync with iTunes.    Using GarageBand on iOS to install a ringtone is not a simple one-step process.  GarageBand requires a user to navigate and find several interesting looking and nearly hidden buttons in order to install a new ringtone.  \n\nOnce the new ringtone file is on your iPhone, you can use the Settings app in order to select your new custom ringtone.\n\nWith Morse Code Ringtone Maker, you can customize the text and the Morse Code/CW speed (combined up to 30 seconds), as well as the the tone frequency.  The Words-Per-Minute (WPM) speed is variable from 5 to 40 WPM.  The tone frequency is customizable from 300 to 1200 Hz.  On the customization page, you can additionally configure Farnsworth timing where the dots and dashes for each letter come even faster than the WPM of the letters.  For different timbres, select Sinewaves, Square-waves or Triangle-waves for your tone sound."

Plus it's easy and intuitive to use, with no need for WiFi or Internet connectivity.  \n \n\nKey Features\n\n•  Allows the accurate setting and matching of critical speaker angles for optimum sound quality.\n\n•  As you adjust a speaker in the room, on-screen speaker icons move and continuously update to display the current speaker angle.\n\n•  Onscreen number boxes change color to let you know when left and right speaker toe-in angles are identical.  \n\n•  Includes user guide that can be printed or shared. \n\n•  Projects are automatically saved as you work and can be freely renamed and recalled. \n\nTo use SpeakerAngle, simply create a stereo or surround sound project and name it. Then adjust your speakers so they are facing straight ahead. Place your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch on top of one of the speakers and press the corresponding onscreen icon, then rotate that speaker towards the listening position. \n\nAs you do so, SpeakerAngle's onscreen display shows you the angle, using red-green color coding to guide you through a range of recommended angles. Next, do the same for the paired speaker in your system until its icon's number box becomes yellow in color, indicating that both speakers are identically angled. A handy onscreen Reset button allows you to start from scratch at any time and experiment with different toe-in angles.\n\nWhen you're ready to fine-tune your system, a menu option allows you to purchase our companion app, SpeakerPro, which allows you to take precise distance measurements and receive intelligent toe-in recommendations. Available on the App Store now!"

See the full list of devices at the bottom of this description.\n\nSEE IN THE DARK\nWith the LiDAR & Infrared Night Vision app, you can use the front camera on devices with FaceID, and the front and back cameras on iPhone 12 Pro, iPad Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max in complete darkness! The front-facing camera will use the infrared sensor in the TrueDepth camera. The rear-facing camera will use the new LiDAR sensor. The LiDAR & Infrared Night Vision app turns the world around you into a depth map, where different colors represent distances from your device.\n\nSCARE YOUR FRIENDS \nTrigger scare-mode and set your friends up for a huge scream.\n\nFor best results, be in complete darkness in a room with space behind you. Explain to your friends how the cool new app shows things around the room you can’t see with the naked eye. Make sure your friend’s face is on the screen, and after 30 seconds, a jump-scare flashes on screen, and captures the terrified face.  \n\nAPPLICATIONS\nSee in the dark without turning on your flashlight\nShow off your new phone capabilities\nScare Your Friends\nMake Your Friends Cry\nShare your friend’s terror with a captured picture or video.\nExplore how LiDAR and infrared technology works\nLearn about depth maps and seeing without light\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nUnlike a regular camera, LiDAR and infrared sensors do not need ambient light.  They both generate their own light, which you cannot see. Therefore, both sensors will work in complete darkness.\n\nOTHER DEVICES\nThis app will work on devices that don’t have LiDAR. It will use the front TrueDepth camera to provide a depth map of yourself and objects behind you. The rear-facing display will not work without an iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro, or iPad Pro (4th Generation).\n\nWorks on any iOS device with FaceID/TrueDepth including: iPhone X, iPhone XS, iphone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPad Pro (3rd generation), iPad Pro (4th generation), iPad Pro 2021"

You can measure everything in a simple way: from \"face to face\", or ”center to center”, and quickly get the solution in the App. Standard pipe sizes and long radius elbows (including ANSI and DIN) can be selected from the list of up to 40 inches.\nThe entire process consists of three steps: \n1) determining the purpose of calculation (question mark symbol)\n2) entering the data \n3) displaying the result of a calculation.\n\nThe result: we have all the necessary information which are needed to create and fold your pipe. Drawings clearly show you the way of what you are looking for and what you need to do. It speeds up the process of work of pipe fitters. \nThe application is being updated all the time and oriented to develop and extend, basing on suggestions of other pipe fitters."

Maintaining husbandry tasks, testing, stability, water changes, inhabitant stats etc. are all vital to keeping successful aquariums. \n\nPocket Marine was designed to make inputting, storing and keeping all information with you at ease. Often, any issues that we have with our aquariums can be linked to actions that were performed a short time beforehand. For this reason, a log of changes made, actions performed or additions can be vital when trying to decipher a problem that may be in play. Pen and paper has always been a great way to keep this information at hand but, Pocket Marine offers a place to store this somewhere that, this day and age, is with us at all times.\n\nNot just for tracking events. Pocket Marine is a great way to help you log your inhabitants into specific tanks, record your latest water change for your mixed reef tank or simply log your latest maintenance action performed on the fish only office tank. Recording your information couldnt be easier and keeping it on your mobile device saves on that frantic search incase of needing the information at a later date.\n\nHelp with that last second impulse buy at the store. With an in depth library of over 800 species of fish, invertebrates and coral and being added to daily, you will always have the information on hand that you need to make that informed decision on a purchase. \n\nWe hope you enjoy using the app and that we can help with your success in the hobby and welcome any feature requests you may have.\n\nHappy Reefing!"

      "label": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass)."

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

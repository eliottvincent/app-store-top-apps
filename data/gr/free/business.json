Build and share low-code apps for your work or school at the Power Apps website.\n\nTIPS\n\n• Swipe right to make an app a favorite, swipe left to add a shortcut to the home screen.\n• As an admin, mark an app as Featured, so that it stays pinned to the top of the apps list.\n• Some apps can work offline, and Power Apps will sync your data when you reconnect.\n\nAccessibility: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121429"

During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

With our encrypted messenger app, your mobile communications will be completely confidential and have the same level of privacy as the spoken word.\n\nYou’ll leave zero trace online with end-to-end encrypted messaging, vanishing messages, screenshot-proof technology, and Incognito Mode. You can even send retractable messages or use our line-by-line text reader.\n\nOver 350 million encrypted messages have already been delivered safely and self-destructed with the help of Confide, while the patented ScreenshieldKit technology prevented more than 7.9K screenshot attempts.\n\nHere's what you get with Confide:\n \nENCRYPTED MESSAGING\nSend private texts and sensitive data with end-to-end encryption. (Your data is never saved on our servers.)\n\nDISAPPEARING MESSAGES\nTurn on Confidential Mode, and your messages will disappear after they’re read. Want to keep them for the day? Turn off Confidential Mode. Regardless, all messages will disappear automatically 24 hours after being sent. \n\nVANISHING iMESSAGES \nConfide’s highly-rated iMessage plugin does what no other technology can: erases your iMessages during any conversation. With Confide, you can compose and send self-destructive messages via iMessage.\n\nSCREENSHOT PREVENTION\nConfide’s patented technology ensures messages cannot be screenshotted by their recipients. Passports, credit cards, personal docs, and sensitive messages stay protected.\n \nPRIVATE AND GROUP MESSAGING\nEnjoy all of the privacy perks of this secret text app, like anonymous text, safe chat, and private texting – whether you’re 1-to-1 messaging or using group chat.\n \nTHREADED CONVERSATIONS\nAdd a layer of security to group texts. Quickly start a thread within the chat experience to keep the momentum going – without disrupting an ongoing group chat conversation.\n\nINCOGNITO MODE\nStay anonymous. Unlike other encrypted messenger apps that announce when a new user has joined, Incognito Mode ensures you become undiscoverable to the people you don’t want to be seen by.\n\nRETRACT UNREAD MESSAGES\nMake private messaging even more private with the option to unsend unread messages. Change your mind? Retract!\n \nADDITIONAL FEATURES:\n* Create nicknames for your contacts\n* Switch themes \n\nAVAILABLE ON MOBILE AND DESKTOP\nUse an anonymous chat, encrypted messaging, safe chat, private text, and Confide’s other features on the go or closer or on your computer.\n\nEveryone deserves their privacy.

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "If you want to grow your leadership skills but don't have time to read every book or sift through endless blog posts, you're in the right place.\n\nBUNCH is an AI leadership coach that enables you to get 1% better every day in just 2 minutes a day. Curious? Here's what you need to know:\n\n****Leadership is a mindset, not a title****\nWhether you're leading yourself, a team, or an entire company, you have what it takes to be a great leader. Once you've got the mindset, you just need the tools. That's where BUNCH comes in!\n\n****Become the leader YOU want to be****\nNo two leaders are alike. That's why BUNCH uses psychology & AI to create a completely unique learning journey tailored for your leadership style, your role, and your interests - so you can build the skills that matter to you and your team.\n\n****Straight to the point with no fluff****\nEach day you'll get a bite-sized leadership tip that distills one key concept that's relevant for you, inspired & vetted by real-world leaders. They're designed to understood and remembered - like getting a summary of the best blog post you ever read.\n\n****Learn, act, reflect, repeat****\nTrue, stable growth comes from improving 1% every day. Get your tip, take action, and see how it goes. There is no try, only do!\n\n****Top 5 signs you should get BUNCH****\n=> You love to learn but don't have time to read every book or comb through every HBR article\n=> You want to empower those around you to do their best work but don’t know how\n=> You’re frustrated with your team: missed deadlines, re-work, slow progress\n=> You keep running into the same problems on project after project\n=> It feels like there’s always too much work and not enough time\n\nJoin a movement alongside 40,000+ other leaders. Here’s what they’re saying:\n\n\"After using BUNCH for a few months, I find it to be a helpful tool with constantly new and updated tips on leadership, it is eye opening for me in fields I have not explored before. I can recommend it to anyone responsible for a team's performance. Added bonus is that it comes with a community of leaders I can discuss related-topics with, and get specific advice.\" - Nader Alexan, CTO @ Airteam\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH user for months now, and there aren't many services that I'm this excited about! I genuinely believe it can be the lever to catapult your career or business - especially if you don't have time to read all the latest management books and HBR articles, but you still need to lead people in your work.\" - Srđan Stanić, Software Engineer at Gravitus\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH beta tester since the very beginning. Over the last year I've watched the app and the content grow into a truly meaningful product experience. Leaders at all levels can benefit from adopting the 2-minute daily habit. I love binging on tips in my free time, and often share content with my team.\" - Merissa Silk, Head of Product @ fundingport\n\n\"I almost dislike how popular BUNCH is becoming because as a beta user, it always felt like my own personal secret weapon! The coach makes it easy to have a moment of reflection each day, and having met the team behind it, I know they’re serious about their mission and vision to enable anyone to be a better leader.\" - Javier Gutiérrez Boronat, Agile Coach & Entrepreneurship Facilitator\n\n“Bunch gave me a template for how to call out team members who’ve gone above and beyond. The team loves it, and It’s really helped them gain a sense of what excellence looks like in their role.” - Cynthia Gordon, Customer Experience Leader @ [monday.com](http://monday.com/)\n\nReady to take the lead?

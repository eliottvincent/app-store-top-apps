      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click.

It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

Mondly is the quick fix that will teach you core German words and German phrases for conversation, just like a phrasebook. \n\nWith Mondly you can learn German sentences and expressions FREE with daily German language lessons online. This app is the effective way for beginners to study verbs, pronunciation and how to speak like a native with daily practice.\n\nThe secret path to language learning\nRemember the German language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of German grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a local. Does it sound familiar? That’s the traditional way to learn a language. But it’s not the fastest and not the most efficient way.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nThis is how the future of language courses looks like\nThe App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn German phrases.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\nState-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your German words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak German clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\nUseful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of words is not the way to go when it comes to learning German.\n\nLearn conversational German. Unless you plan on reading science books, conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core German vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs and speak German clearly.\n\nVerb conjugations. Conversations are fun, but the foundation of a foreign language is grammar. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the German verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\nThe Leaderboard. We made learning easy and fun, so why not throw in some more game elements, such as score? See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly family.\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these German lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

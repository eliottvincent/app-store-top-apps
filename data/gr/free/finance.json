When banking online, use pushTAN, an advanced, mobile security procedure.\n\nIT'S THAT EASY\n• When banking online with iPhone, iPad or computer, place your payment orders and send them.\n• The S-pushTAN app always shows the details of the order. Just check the order data and release the order by swiping.\n• Usable for all orders with TAN release. Whether transfers, submitting or changing standing orders, securitie or service orders and much more.\n\nLET'S GO AFTER ACTIVATION BY YOUR SPARKASSE\nYou can start with the S-pushTAN app if you are registered for the pushTAN procedure and have got your personal registration letter.\n\n1 - Apply for the pushTAN procedure or switch from your previously used procedure at the online branch of your Sparkasse.\n2 - Download the S-pushTAN app to your iPhone or iPad for free.\n3 - As soon as you have received the registration letter from your Sparkasse, start setting up the S-pushTAN app. \n\nSAFETY\n• The S-pushTAN app communicates exclusively encrypted via tested interfaces and ensures secure data transfer according to German online banking requirements.\n• Access to S-pushTAN is protected by a password you have chosen and optionally by Touch ID or Face ID.\n• The app automatically locks after a short period of time, which means that your data is secured as much as possible even if the iPhone or iPad gets lost.\n• The German TÜV confirms these highest safety standards every year anew.\n\nWORTH TO KNOW\n• In order to be able to use pushTAN, you need an activation by your Sparkasse and a registration letter for the first setup.\n• In order to use the current version of the app, you need iOS from version 13 on your iPhone or iPad.\n• If your iPhone or iPad is jailbroken, S-pushTAN is not executable on it.

      "label": "The free and easy solution to share your expenses with others. Create or check your tricount now to add your expenses.\n\nUsed by millions of people because short reckonings make long friends :-)!\n\nVery practical for holidays, housesharing, events, couples evenings, etc.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n• A clean and simple interface.\n• If you want, share accounts with a group: everyone will see them and can add their own expenses.\n• Divide expenses unevenly: good for travelling with couples or children, for example.\n• Works with the app and online: accounts are visible in the app, but also online!\n• Works offline to ensure perfect use in every part of the world... even on the beach!\n• You can turn on notifications to see if others are adding or editing expenses, and link your tricount list to your email address.\n\nWHAT USERS SAY:\n\n\"The best expenses app I've ever downloaded. The app is very intuitive\" - Michael P.\n\"Makes sharing bills with friends so much easier, many useful options, an absolute must have.\" - Tom C.\n\"Super useful - my flatmates and I can't live without it anymore!\" Sarah P.\n\nTHEY RECOMMEND TRICOUNT :\n\nFORBES:\n\"With Tricount, you can create a group expense report on your phone. It tracks spending by person, and then splits up how much each individual owes or is owed from the total balance. When you’re ready to share the final breakdown, the app sends each person a link to Tricount’s site to review the data.\"\n\nBUSINESS INSIDER:\n\"Next time you organize a group activity, Tricount will split up the expenses for you\".\n\nABOUT IN-APP PURCHASES\n\nAs of version 2.1, Tricount offers in-App purchase subscriptions valid for one year. \n\nThe price of the subscription is 6.99€ (Premium) and may depend on your territory and is clearly indicated on the subscription page. Payment will be directly charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. The subscription renewal costs the same price as the one of the original subscription. After purchase, you can disable auto-renewal in your user's Account Settings. Note that no cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Tricount's terms and conditions are available at https://tricount.com/en/terms\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\ncreate a tricount, share your link with friends ... et voilà!\n\nTricount makes sorting out and divvying your group expenses very easy when you organize activities (for example: ski trip, citytrip, holidays with a classroom, flatmates etc.)\n\nGone are the days of the old excel file: an easier and effective solution exists to breakdown the costs, sharing expense reports, list tickets and spending. Tricount does the accounting and balances the cost for your group expenses.\n\nIt lets you breakdown the budget of a group and track expenses during a trip or any occasion with friends. It can be used by couples, between colleagues, roommates & flatmates. It is a simple yet powerful tool to figure out who owes what to whom and balance spendings : I owe you, you owe me (IOU) ... so easy!\n\nCreate your group expenses on your mobile (even offline), during your group activity. Send everyone the link (a la Doodle), and your friends too can add their own expense or see your changes.\n\nTricount then tells you who should pay what to whom to balance the group.\n\nVery useful for any activity with friends and colleagues: holiday, city-trip, flat sharing & flatmates, week-ends, everyday lunch with colleagues, parties, etc. In your couple, you can create a tricount to know who has paid what this month, or on holiday.\nThe app exists for most mobile devices, and on the web! All currencies are accepted, even bitcoins if you want."

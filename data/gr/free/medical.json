Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students.

The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings.

The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more!

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

For Patients, the App provides easy to understand emergency steps to take in all dental injuries.  The immediate care provided at the site of injury will determine the survival of the injured tooth and the smile of your child. This App should be in every mobile device of everyone around the world. In order to save more teeth and smiles, it’s important you share this App with as many people you can. Start with friends, relatives, teachers and coaches.\n\nFor Professionals, quick access to the Dental Trauma Guidelines provide detailed information caring for patients with dental injuries.  They represent the current evidence based on literature research and professional opinion, as well as additional information about the IADT and resources for continuing education.  As is true for all guidelines, the health care provider must apply clinical judgment dictated by the conditions present in the given traumatic situation. The IADT does not guarantee favorable outcomes from following the Guidelines, but using the recommended procedures can maximize the chances of success."

      "label": "The simplest program to track breastfeeding, pumping, bottle feeding, solid food consumption, diapers, sleep schedule, height and weight, and more.\n\nWith the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.\n\nThe birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

They need accurate information about the hazardous substances, the emergency resources available, and the surrounding environmental conditions to save lives and minimize the impact on the environment and physical property. The WISER application extracts content from PubChem, an authoritative, peer-reviewed information resource maintained by the National Library of Medicine, and places that information into the hands of those who need it most. \n\nFeatures of WISER \n\n* Rapid access to the most important information about a hazardous substance by an intelligent synopsis engine and display called “Key Info” \n\n* Intuitive, simple, logical user interface developed by working with experienced first responders \n\n* Comprehensive decision support, including assistance in identification of an unknown substance and, once the substance is identified, guidance on immediate actions necessary to save lives and protect the environment \n\n* GIS support provides for isolation/protective distance overlays on a map of the incident \n\n* Access to NLM’s PubChem and Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management (CHEMM) content, which contains a wealth of detailed, peer-reviewed information on hazardous substances\n\n* Interactive chemical reactivity data, allowing WISER to predict hazards caused by a user prescribed mix of chemicals\n\n* User Profiles enable users to specify the role they are currently playing at the scene of an incident: first responder, HAZMAT specialist, EMS specialist, hospital provider, or preparedness planner. The key information presented to the user about a substance varies depending on this role, so that the information most relevant to the respective job can be quickly accessed. \n\n* Radiological and biological substance support. \n\n* Tools and reference materials, including triage tools, radiological incident support, WMD response guidelines, and an electronic version of the ERG 2016\n\n* Mobile support, providing first responders critical information where they need it, when they need it."

With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\n\n\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals.

      "label": "Blood pressure diary app including weight tracker, blood sugar tracker, medication calendar and medication reminder.\nAn external blood pressure monitor is required to record values.\n\nApproximately one quarter of the world's population is suffering from hypertension, 5% suffer from low blood pressure (hypotension). Many people do not even know that they are affected, as it usually come without symptoms. However, it is risk factor number one for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore people should check their values regularly and keep the data in a bp log.\n\nAt the end of 2018 we finally wanted to take high blood pressure management more seriously ourselves and started developing a smart blood pressure app: AVAX Blood Pressure Diary.\n\n* CORE FEATURES\nSome the reasons that make it the best free blood pressure app:\n- Comprehensive charts help you to visualize longer periods of data.\n- Statistics that follow current hypertension guidelines and that are easy to understand and give a clear picture of what your arterial pressure looks like.\n- Our medication calendar let's you track your intake history and allows you to set up custom medication reminder to avoid forgetting to take your medication.\n- The app can also remind you whenever it is time for you to take your blood pressure.\n- A monthly status chart shows you if you are actively tracking our bp.\n- Easily view your history and export it to CSV or XLSX. There is no limitation to get your data.\n- New records can be entered in just a few seconds\n- Weight tracker: Track weight (to see if there is a link) or manage weight loss.\n- Diabetes tracker: We help you to track blood sugar and manage diabetes.\n- Various customization options to make our bp app work you and not the other way round.\n\n* USAGE INFORMATION & DATA PROTECTION\nProtecting your personal data is very important to us. The key points here are:\n- Login via google account or via email - or use the app completely anonymously (without login)\n- We do not track any information that would help someone to identify you. Only your email address is being recorded (unless you do not use a login at all, of course)\n- No data is being shared with 3rd parties\n- No permissions on your phone or access to personal information is required\n- An active internet connection is needed to syncronize across devices\n\n* IMPORTANT INFORMATION\nFinally, one last important piece of information: Our app is designed as a companion app for information only. Measuring with your home blood pressure checker, keeping a blood pressure log in a blood pressure tracker app should be part of your therapy, but it can't replace a doctor. We can not be made liable for any issues that occur as a result of using our hypertension app, our medication diary or weight tracker. Please consult your doctor to discuss hypertension management.\n\nWe hope you enjoy our app and it helps you to keep your diary and possibly even lower blood pressure levels or achieve weight loss. If you like us, we would be very happy about your feedback and rating.\n\nIf you have suggestions for features or encounter any issues, please reach out to us at info@avax.app\n\nStart now with AVAX Blood Pressure Diary free of charge!\n\nTerms of Use: https://avax.app/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://avax.app/privacy-policy"

Also, the person with diabetes needs a MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump, the MiniMed™ Mobile app installed on a compatible mobile device, which then should be connected online to the CareLink™ software. To find a list of compatible devices, please visit your local Medtronic website. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: In order to receive real-time updates, the app needs to continuously receive data from the CareLink™ servers, and the insulin pump system needs to sync with the CareLink™ servers through the MiniMed™ Mobile app. The CareLink™ Connect app only works with the MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump systems; it currently does not support other standalone CGM systems, MiniMed™ or Paradigm™ insulin pumps. \r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app is intended to provide a secondary display of insulin pump and CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) system data on a supported mobile device.

OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

Download now!\n\nGlomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is the amount of blood filtered by the kidney in a minute. This GFR value is an indicator of renal function, so it is used widely in diagnosis and staging of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). GFR is the optimal way to measure kidney function. Normal GFR varies according to age, sex, and body size. In \"Pocket GFR Calculator: Kidney Health & CKD Stage\", the stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its management based on the eGFR values are also given. You also can use \"All Formulas\" feature to compare the result of several formulas for the same patient. \"Pocket GFR Calculator: Kidney Health & CKD Stage\" has several formulas used for GFR calculations, namely:\n- Cockroft-Gault Formula\n- Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study Equation\n- CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation (2009)\n- CKD-EPI Cystatin and Creatinine Equation (2012)\n- Schwartz Formula for paediatric eGFR measurement.\n\nDisclaimer: all calculations must be re-checked and should not be used alone to guide patient care, nor should they substitute for clinical judgment.

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

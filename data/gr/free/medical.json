The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

An intelligent alarm clock that wakes you up refreshed in your light sleep phase with gentle nature sounds (birds, sea, wind...) \n\n【Detailed Sleep Analysis】\n-Sleep Monitor will systematically analyze your bedtime behaviors and sleep patterns, then generate your sleep score to improve your sleep.\n-According to weekly or monthly sleep reports, scientifically analyze sleep data and discover changes over time.\n\n【Mark Sleep Factors/Add Sleep Notes】\n-If you drink coffee, eat late, do exercise or have any pathological conditions before sleep, mark these sleep factors or take brief notes for your sleep, then discover how these factors/notes affect your sleep quality.\n\n【Apple Health Integration】\n-Fully integrated with Apple Health, exchanging steps and heart rate.\n\nTARGET USERS\n-People who are suffering sleep disturbances (difficulty falling asleep, frequent wake-ups, dreaminess, insomnia)\n-People who want to do self-diagnosis whether there are signs of poor sleep quality\n-People who want to understand their sleep quality and improve their sleep\n-Sleep Monitor is especially helpful for those who want to monitor their sleep quality, and don’t want to spend money on wearable devices such as smartwatches\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n√ Place your iPhone near your pillow or next to your bed\n√ Sleep alone to eliminate distractions\n√ Sufficient battery\n\nMake sure your bedroom is quiet, dark & cool, feel relaxed before sleep.\nWishing you a full and sweet sleep like a baby!\nABOUT SUBSCRIPTION\nSleep Monitor offers three auto-renewing subscription options:\n-$9.99 per week\n-$14.99 per month\n-$39.99 per year (that's less than $3.33 a month)\n\n-It will be charged from your iTunes account after the purchase.\n-The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours before the subscription period ends with the same kind of subscription you already bought at the same price.

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "This application consists of three modules: RECORDER, SMART ALARM, STOP SNORING.\n\nRECORDER\nRecords your talk or snoring while you are asleep (automatic or manual sensitivity level, records only snoring using smart snoring detection), creates the graph of noise in room during the night, takes the total time of snoring down.\n\nSMART ALARM\nHelps you wake up easy in your lightest sleep phase and allows you to get up relaxed every morning. Improve your sleep naturally, maximize your sleep efficiency. \n\nSTOP SNORING\nTries to stop your snoring by playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected.\n\nBy using the tracker data and by defining your own factors (activities/means/drugs/custom notes) it is possible to find out which facts influence your sleep positively and limit your snoring. At your disposal there are beautiful statistic charts for simple and efficient analyzing of your sleeps/nights.\n\nSnoring detection is based on artificial intelligence (A.I.) with the support of a new Apple machine learning technology. By using a large number of snoring samples, we can achieve high accuracy in statistics and in snoring detection itself.\n\nHow to place your device correctly is shown in instructions. \n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- ADJUSTABLE RECORDING SOUND SENSITIVITY:\nFor different sound conditions in your room (a quiet or loud environment).\n\n- HIGH TECH SNORING DETECTION:\nAccurate snoring detection based on A.I.\n\n- POSSIBILITY OF RECORDING ONLY SNORING\n\n- AUDIO VISUALIZATION DURING RECORDING OR PLAYING\n\n- FAVORITE RECORDINGS\n\n- SHARING RECORDINGS WITH YOUR FRIENDS:\nSend recordings via email, iMessage or post to Facebook\n\n- UNLIMITED ALARMS: \nSet your own alarms, daily alarms, weekly alarms, etc. You can use included alarm sounds or your own iPod music.\n\n- SMART WAKE UP: \nWake you up with gradual alarm when you are in your lightest sleep phase (based on your movements).\n\n- SLEEP TRACKER:\nSleep cycle analyzes and statistics with complete history and beautiful charts.\n\n- SNOOZE BY SHAKING:\nNo need to unlock screen or enter password.\n\n- STOP SNORING:\nPossibility of playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected. \n\n- FACTORS, WAKE UP MOOD, NOTES:\nUser can place factors (alcohol, coffee, stress etc.) to every night as well as the mood after waking up or users own notes.\n\n- ACTIVATION DELAY:\nStart monitoring after a period of time.\n\n- BACKGROUND MODE:\nMonitoring runs also in background mode. Alarm also fires from background.\n\n- APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION\n\n- iCLOUD SYNCHRONIZATION:\nSynchronization among your devices and between free and paid version.\n\n- EXPORTING HISTORY TO CSV FILE\n\n- APPLE WATCH:\nTracks your sleep movements and plays haptic (sound, vibration) if alarm is triggered or snoring is detected.\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\nHappy customers are our highest priority.

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more!

This is because in the daily hustle and bustle, things are simply forgotten, but the consequences can be dire…We bet you've definitely experienced this situation at least once in your life. \nMany people are used to using their alarm clock as a pill reminder - it rings at a certain time and you know exactly what time it is to take your pills. But it's a bygone era. Would you go to work or on a date with an alarm clock? Of course not! Or, for example, stickers or a notebook that you can always forget at home and miss your medication. It is much better and easier to keep a pill tracker in your smartphone. \nTaking medication is a big responsibility that affects how we feel and our health in general. And even classic reminders cannot perform their function to the best of their ability, the medication reminder is the best way to go about it.  \nTiming is important when taking many medications, especially antibiotics, contraceptives, hormones and antivirals. Taking care of your health is an important part of your lifestyle, and the med tracker is a great addition to this.\nIn this medication alarm app you have many functions - you can enter your treatment course, create a personalized schedule, set reminders to take various medications and even monitor your body parameters (weight, height, temperature and so on). \nIt's a real diary where you can keep track of your activities and changes! \nUsing a medication tracker can not only improve your health status, it can also have a positive impact on the dynamics of the healthcare system. Such pill reminder and med tracker apps teach you how to be responsible, and this is a key step towards recovery!\nThe medicine reminder can be used as an indispensable aid in the treatment of chronic diseases, especially hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and many others. For example, a person with diabetes will be able to keep track of his/her weight, keep his/her records directly in the medicine tracker and never forget to take pills!\nA pill reminder alarm will alert you if you have missed your medication, and will remind you to stick to your medication schedule. Easy to set up and use - the interface is so user-friendly. \nOur team's main aim is for all people to be healthy, which is why we created this app. We do not share your data with third parties, all information is strictly confidential.

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

      "label": "Blood pressure diary app including weight tracker, blood sugar tracker, medication calendar and medication reminder.\nAn external blood pressure monitor is required to record values.\n\nApproximately one quarter of the world's population is suffering from hypertension, 5% suffer from low blood pressure (hypotension). Many people do not even know that they are affected, as it usually come without symptoms. However, it is risk factor number one for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore people should check their values regularly and keep the data in a bp log.\n\nAt the end of 2018 we finally wanted to take high blood pressure management more seriously ourselves and started developing a smart blood pressure app: AVAX Blood Pressure Diary.\n\n* CORE FEATURES\nSome the reasons that make it the best free blood pressure app:\n- Comprehensive charts help you to visualize longer periods of data.\n- Statistics that follow current hypertension guidelines and that are easy to understand and give a clear picture of what your arterial pressure looks like.\n- Our medication calendar let's you track your intake history and allows you to set up custom medication reminder to avoid forgetting to take your medication.\n- The app can also remind you whenever it is time for you to take your blood pressure.\n- A monthly status chart shows you if you are actively tracking our bp.\n- Easily view your history and export it to CSV or XLSX. There is no limitation to get your data.\n- New records can be entered in just a few seconds\n- Weight tracker: Track weight (to see if there is a link) or manage weight loss.\n- Diabetes tracker: We help you to track blood sugar and manage diabetes.\n- Various customization options to make our bp app work you and not the other way round.\n\n* USAGE INFORMATION & DATA PROTECTION\nProtecting your personal data is very important to us. The key points here are:\n- Login via google account or via email - or use the app completely anonymously (without login)\n- We do not track any information that would help someone to identify you. Only your email address is being recorded (unless you do not use a login at all, of course)\n- No data is being shared with 3rd parties\n- No permissions on your phone or access to personal information is required\n- An active internet connection is needed to syncronize across devices\n\n* IMPORTANT INFORMATION\nFinally, one last important piece of information: Our app is designed as a companion app for information only. Measuring with your home blood pressure checker, keeping a blood pressure log in a blood pressure tracker app should be part of your therapy, but it can't replace a doctor. We can not be made liable for any issues that occur as a result of using our hypertension app, our medication diary or weight tracker. Please consult your doctor to discuss hypertension management.\n\nWe hope you enjoy our app and it helps you to keep your diary and possibly even lower blood pressure levels or achieve weight loss. If you like us, we would be very happy about your feedback and rating.\n\nIf you have suggestions for features or encounter any issues, please reach out to us at info@avax.app\n\nStart now with AVAX Blood Pressure Diary free of charge!\n\nTerms of Use: https://avax.app/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://avax.app/privacy-policy"

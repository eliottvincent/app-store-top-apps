Μάθετε περισσότερα σχετικά με τα συμβατά τηλέφωνα στη διεύθυνση http://FreeStyleLibre.com.\r\n\r\nΧΡΗΣΗ ΤΗΣ ΕΦΑΡΜΟΓΗΣ ΣΑΣ ΚΑΙ ΤΗΣ ΣΥΣΚΕΥΗΣ ΑΝΑΓΝΩΣΗΣ ΜΕ ΤΟΝ ΙΔΙΟ ΑΙΣΘΗΤΗΡΑ\r\nΟι ειδοποιήσεις μπορούν να εμφανιστούν μόνο στη συσκευή ανάγνωσης FreeStyle Libre 2 ή στο τηλέφωνό σας (όχι και στα δύο). Για να λαμβάνετε ειδοποιήσεις στο τηλέφωνό σας, πρέπει να εκκινήσετε τον αισθητήρα με την εφαρμογή. Για να λαμβάνετε ειδοποιήσεις στη συσκευή ανάγνωσης FreeStyle Libre 2, πρέπει να εκκινήσετε τον αισθητήρα με τη συσκευή ανάγνωσής σας.  Αφού εκκινηθεί ο αισθητήρας με τη συσκευή ανάγνωσης, μπορείτε επίσης να σαρώσετε τον συγκεκριμένο αισθητήρα με το τηλέφωνό σας.\r\n\r\nΝα θυμάστε ότι δεν μπορεί να γίνει μεταφορά δεδομένων μεταξύ της εφαρμογής και της συσκευής ανάγνωσης. Για πλήρη λήψη δεδομένων σε μια συσκευή, σαρώνετε τον αισθητήρα σας κάθε 8 ώρες με την ίδια συσκευή, διαφορετικά, οι αναφορές σας δεν θα περιλαμβάνουν όλα τα δεδομένα σας. Μπορείτε να ανεβάζετε και να προβάλλετε δεδομένα από όλες τις συσκευές σας στο LibreView.com.\r\n\r\nΠΛΗΡΟΦΟΡΙΕΣ ΓΙΑ ΤΗΝ ΕΦΑΡΜΟΓΗ\r\nΗ εφαρμογή FreeStyle LibreLink χρησιμοποιείται για τη μέτρηση των επιπέδων γλυκόζης σε άτομα με διαβήτη σε συνδυασμό με έναν αισθητήρα.

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "This App is a handy and reliable assistant for tracking your newborn baby’s daily activities. You can track breastfeeding, bottle feeding, solid food feeding and milk pumping. You can save diaper changes, sleeping periods and the results of your baby's height and weight measurements.\n\nWith this baby care app, you get all of these incredible features:\n- Track feeding by one breast or by both, if you give your baby two breasts at one feeding\n- Track bottle feeding \n- Fix solid food feeding - food and its amount\n- If you need to express your milk, you can fix how many ml/oz of each breast were pumped \n- Fix diaper changing, you can note whether it is wet or dirty, or both\n- Always know how many diapers were changed per day\n- Record baths, temperatures, walks, and medications\n- Handy breastfeeding timer and sleeping timer are easy to stop and to restart\n- Your baby's height and weight can be measured almost daily!

Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

When snoring is detected you will receive a notification every two seconds.\nThe notification can be configured to vibrate or make a sound on your iPhone or Apple Watch encouraging you to change your sleep position.\n\nOnce snoring isn't detected anymore the vibrations will stop automatically!\n\nGreat news!\n\nApple has approved Koala Nap for usage of Critical Alerts allowing the vibrations to override the Do Not Disturb setting!\nMake sure to allow Critical Alerts in the apps settings, and you're good to go.\n\nWe also added Siri support, allowing custom automations! \n\nKoala Naps advanced snore detection utilises the latest MACHINE LEARNING algorithms, and large data set of snoring sounds. The result is an accurate detection of snoring, ignoring non snoring background sounds, for example baby crying, motor sounds etc'.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Koala Nap is designed to detect real snoring sounds and patterns, meaning that trying to fake snoring sounds simply will not work. We recommend using it over night and check out the results in the morning. If there seems to be a problem with real snore detection, please send a support email from within the app or from our site https://www.koalanap.com.\n\nKoala Nap is GDPR compliant in the European region!\n\nDownload Koala Nap now!\n\nKoala Nap offers a 7 DAY FREE TRIAL, cancel any time within the trial period without getting billed. You only pay for Koala Nap if you find it helpful in reducing snoring, so don't be afraid to try it out.\n\n---For best results---\n\nUse the app a few times as the snore detection is based on machine learning which increases in accuracy the more the app is used. Make sure to allow uploading snore samples in the app settings, which are used for training the snore detection algorithm. \n\nTry to reduce background noise for example TV, radio or other loud devices.\n\nMake sure to enable internet when the app launches, in order to update the snore detection algorithm. Keep the app version up to date.\n\nGood and quiet night :)\n\nPrivacy policy: https://flycricket.io/koala-nap/privacy.html"

      "label": "An instant guide to Valve in Valve procedures for clinicians.\n\nValve in Valve Mitral app provides information specific for a clinical scenario, quickly and simply. This will help in the planning of and performing a mitral Valve in Valve or Valve in Ring case. The application navigates the user through important aspects of surgical mitral valves, mitral rings and TAVR valve design, which are vital for a successful Valve in Valve or ring procedure. The app logically steps through the possible combinations to give the user specific information needed to perform the procedure.\n\nSuccess of a Valve in Valve or ring procedure is based on correct identification of the surgical valve or Ring, choosing the correct size of the TAVR valve and its subsequent accurate placement. Surgical valves and rings vary in appearance under fluoroscopy and also in their internal diameter. Similarly TAVR valves differ in their appearances and available sizes.\n\nKnowledge about all the surgical valves and rings that have been implanted in the last two decades is minimal but relevant to the Valve in Valve or ring therapy. Users can now familiarize themselves with important design information about surgical valves, rings and TAVR valves; they can also select the valve and find out which size of TAVR valve could be used and how it is best placed during a Valve in Valve or ring procedure.\n\nIt also gives information about differences between TAVR valve sizing for mitral and aortic valve in valve procedure. Mitral ring properties, which will have a big implication when considering a valve in ring procedure are also discussed. It alerts the user about potential problems especially when considering valve in ring in certain designs.\n\nThe Valve In Valve Mitral app can be used to plan a case and confirm suitability for this procedure and reduces the need to trawl through vast amounts of literature to find information specific to the clinical scenario. The information is also available without the need for an internet connection and will enhance the users understanding of various aspects of this procedure. We hope this will result in improved results and better outcomes for patients.\n\nAt the heart of the idea is education that is free to use. It is hoped that the App will encourage users to contribute tips, tricks and feedback so that we can continue to develop the app.\n\nFull list of features\n\n- Design information for multiple types of surgical valves.\n- Sizing information for multiple types of surgical valves.\n- Real life and fluoroscopic images of all the surgical valves.\n- Design information for multiple types of surgical rings.\n- Sizing information for multiple types of surgical rings.\n- Real life and fluoroscopic images of all the surgical rings.\n- Design information about TAVR valve designs.\n- Sizing information for these TAVR valves.\n- Guides the user through a stepped process to help choose a specific valve or ring, then the size and lastly the important dimensions to plan a Valve in Valve or ring procedure.\n- Image based guidance for the ideal placement of a TAVR valve.\n- Video examples of actual placement of a TAVR valve.\n- Discusses important design considerations in detail to improve understanding of the Valve in Valve procedure.\n\nQuick, clear and concise information about heart valves and rings and Valve in Valve therapy. A guide you wish you always had at your fingertips.\n\nThe App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using Valve in Valve Mitral!"

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "Facial recognition technology, at the service of assisted reproduction techniques with Ovobank’s oocytes\nOvobank, the first egg bank in Europe, launches Ovomatch®, an innovative facial recognition system based on a mathematical algorithm and connected to its extensive database which searches among donors for the one that most resembles the recipient patient, at the same time that the complete anonymity that the law sets for egg donors is preserved at all times. The patient only has to input her physical characteristics and take a 'selfie' and the app will tell her at that precise moment how many donors with a high similarity to her are in the system. For the first time, facial recognition technology is applied to treatments with egg donation.\nWhen a couple (or a woman with no male partner) requires an assisted reproduction treatment with egg donation, the most worrying question is whether their future baby will be physically similar to them. With the Ovomatch® system, Ovobank’s new APP , for free download on any mobile device, a patient can know, at that precise moment, the number of available donors with high similarity among the more than 4,000 existing in the Ovobank database, without, at any time breaking the anonymity that is marked by the law in these procedures.\nThe 'matching' work done by the Ovobank team, which takes into account phenotypic traits of the couple or the woman such as blood group, etc., is now joined with the technology of facial recognition. Ovomatch® scans multiple facial points of donors and recipients and compares them, thanks to a mathematical facial recognition algorithm, with its extensive database to find donors more like recipients. Anonymity is fully guaranteed and the selected donor, in addition to a total phenotypic compatibility, will have a high facial resemblance to the recipient patient, selecting the donor based on an objective process."

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

Usually, sleepers will pass four sleep stages in one sleep cycle: Non-REM 1(between waking and sleep), Non-REM 2(light sleep), Non-REM 3(deep sleep), and REM sleep(dreaming). \n-Every night we will track your sleep so that you can understand your sleep cycles from a scientific perspective.\n\n【Bedtime Reminder & Smart Alarm Clock】\n-Allow notification access to remind you to sleep at bedtime. \n-Do you always wake up sleepy? An intelligent alarm clock that wakes you up refreshed in your light sleep phase with gentle nature sounds (birds, sea, wind...) \n\n【Detailed Sleep Analysis】\n-Sleep Monitor will systematically analyze your bedtime behaviors and sleep patterns, then generate your sleep score to improve your sleep.\n-According to weekly or monthly sleep reports, scientifically analyze sleep data and discover changes over time.\n\n【Mark Sleep Factors/Add Sleep Notes】\n-If you drink coffee, eat late, do exercise or have any pathological conditions before sleep, mark these sleep factors or take brief notes for your sleep, then discover how these factors/notes affect your sleep quality.\n\n【Apple Health Integration】\n-Fully integrated with Apple Health, exchanging steps and heart rate.\n\nTARGET USERS\n-People who are suffering sleep disturbances (difficulty falling asleep, frequent wake-ups, dreaminess, insomnia)\n-People who want to do self-diagnosis whether there are signs of poor sleep quality\n-People who want to understand their sleep quality and improve their sleep\n-Sleep Monitor is especially helpful for those who want to monitor their sleep quality, and don’t want to spend money on wearable devices such as smartwatches\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n√ Place your iPhone near your pillow or next to your bed\n√ Sleep alone to eliminate distractions\n√ Sufficient battery\n\nMake sure your bedroom is quiet, dark & cool, feel relaxed before sleep.\nWishing you a full and sweet sleep like a baby!\nABOUT SUBSCRIPTION\nSleep Monitor offers three auto-renewing subscription options:\n-$9.99 per week\n-$14.99 per month\n-$39.99 per year (that's less than $3.33 a month)\n\n-It will be charged from your iTunes account after the purchase.\n-The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours before the subscription period ends with the same kind of subscription you already bought at the same price.

They are attracted by light, body odor, lactic acid, carbon dioxide and heat.\n\nTurn on the application and keep it close to you it will produce high frequency sound and mosquitos will avert you.

      "label": "This application consists of three modules: RECORDER, SMART ALARM, STOP SNORING.\n\nRECORDER\nRecords your talk or snoring while you are asleep (automatic or manual sensitivity level, records only snoring using smart snoring detection), creates the graph of noise in room during the night, takes the total time of snoring down.\n\nSMART ALARM\nHelps you wake up easy in your lightest sleep phase and allows you to get up relaxed every morning. Improve your sleep naturally, maximize your sleep efficiency. \n\nSTOP SNORING\nTries to stop your snoring by playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected.\n\nBy using the tracker data and by defining your own factors (activities/means/drugs/custom notes) it is possible to find out which facts influence your sleep positively and limit your snoring. At your disposal there are beautiful statistic charts for simple and efficient analyzing of your sleeps/nights.\n\nSnoring detection is based on artificial intelligence (A.I.) with the support of a new Apple machine learning technology. By using a large number of snoring samples, we can achieve high accuracy in statistics and in snoring detection itself.\n\nHow to place your device correctly is shown in instructions. \n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- ADJUSTABLE RECORDING SOUND SENSITIVITY:\nFor different sound conditions in your room (a quiet or loud environment).\n\n- HIGH TECH SNORING DETECTION:\nAccurate snoring detection based on A.I.\n\n- POSSIBILITY OF RECORDING ONLY SNORING\n\n- AUDIO VISUALIZATION DURING RECORDING OR PLAYING\n\n- FAVORITE RECORDINGS\n\n- SHARING RECORDINGS WITH YOUR FRIENDS:\nSend recordings via email, iMessage or post to Facebook\n\n- UNLIMITED ALARMS: \nSet your own alarms, daily alarms, weekly alarms, etc. You can use included alarm sounds or your own iPod music.\n\n- SMART WAKE UP: \nWake you up with gradual alarm when you are in your lightest sleep phase (based on your movements).\n\n- SLEEP TRACKER:\nSleep cycle analyzes and statistics with complete history and beautiful charts.\n\n- SNOOZE BY SHAKING:\nNo need to unlock screen or enter password.\n\n- STOP SNORING:\nPossibility of playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected. \n\n- FACTORS, WAKE UP MOOD, NOTES:\nUser can place factors (alcohol, coffee, stress etc.) to every night as well as the mood after waking up or users own notes.\n\n- ACTIVATION DELAY:\nStart monitoring after a period of time.\n\n- BACKGROUND MODE:\nMonitoring runs also in background mode. Alarm also fires from background.\n\n- APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION\n\n- iCLOUD SYNCHRONIZATION:\nSynchronization among your devices and between free and paid version.\n\n- EXPORTING HISTORY TO CSV FILE\n\n- APPLE WATCH:\nTracks your sleep movements and plays haptic (sound, vibration) if alarm is triggered or snoring is detected.\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\nHappy customers are our highest priority. If you have a problem with our app, please contact us at stopsnoring4@apirox.com.\n\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\nYour payment will be charged to your iTunes Account as soon as you confirm your purchase.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

      "label": "Visualmed app provides visual infographic based summaries of landmark clinical trials in medicine and other fields of health care. \n\nThe pace at which new data in medicine is getting published is tremendous and to keep up with it we need a way to quickly access the key points of landmark clinical trials. In order to fill that gap, we came up with Visualmed. \n\nThe app version of visualmed lets users sort clinical trials based on the field of medicine. For example, if you're looking for landmark trials in cardiology then simply access the cardiology subcategory. Additionally, we have added year based sorting of studies that let users access studies that are published in 2020 or which were published back in the 90s!. The best way to use this app is when you're rounding on your patients and a question arises regarding patient care for which you need to look up supportive evidence in the form of landmark clinical trial on that topic.\n\nWith our search tool, you can quickly put in keywords to access clinical trials on that subject. For example, if you write aspirin the search bar you will obtain access to all landmark clinical trials done on aspirin. Tapping on a trial will give you a visual summary highlighting the key objective, type, and primary findings of that trial.\n\nThe app gets updated with more recent studies every day so make sure to check out the recent tab to access all the latest clinical trials in medicine. We added 30 new trials every month so with just one time subscription fee you will be getting access to all our trials visual abstracts.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n1. Access an ever-growing list of landmark clinical trials visual summaries for lifetime with just one time $6 subscription fee.\n2. Sort and search for trials based on disease, topic or year of publication\n3. Bookmark your favorite visual summaries for later reference\n4. Each summary is linked back to the original article"

They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves.

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

Or to gain confidence before performing a procedure you perform less commonly?\n \nThe Dechra Dog & Cat Anaesthesia app is a unique resource designed to put practical, accessible information into the hands of veterinarians, veterinary nurses/technicians and vet students. Developed with specialist veterinary anaesthetists and approved by the Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists (AVA), the app contains suggested anaesthetic protocols for 24 procedures in the dog and 15 in the cat. It is like having a veterinary anaesthetist in your pocket!\n \nEach procedure contains up to date, detailed anaesthetic considerations for the patient including pre-op stabilisation where required, appropriate premedication options, peri-operative analgesia and details about induction, maintenance, monitoring, and recovery. This allows you to choose the most appropriate protocol for every unique patient.\nThe app also contains information about 36 of the most commonly used molecules in dog and cat anaesthesia, allowing you to confidently choose and use the most appropriate molecule for every situation. A suggested dosage and route of administration is given, alongside information about indication, time to onset and duration of action, contraindications and side effects.\nThe app includes an easy to use dose calculator so that you can quickly calculate the doses required for your patient and also allows you to design your own protocols. Each completed protocol can be saved into your favourites folder to use again, or you can email the protocol summary to be saved in the patient’s clinical records, or to be printed.\n\nDechra are advocates of patient safety and are keen to promote best practice anaesthesia. As part of this commitment we have included the AVA Anaesthetic Safety Checklist within the app. The Dechra Dog and Cat Anaesthesia App reinforces Dechra as leaders in veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia and provides unprecedented technical support to veterinary professionals."

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

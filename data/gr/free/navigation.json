The application receives data either according to the geo-location of the device (uses the GPS signal of the device) or based on the location pointed out by the user on the map (with long press). You can also filter out the received data based on the desired brand, fuel type and price age. Fuel types supported are petrol (all types), diesel (all types), liquid gas (LPG) and natural gas (CNG).\n\nThe application is THE ONLY ONE with manually verified fuel station positions (for >93% of the fuel stations). This allows services like Google Street View pictures for the stations, estimation of distance to a station, navigation guidance, etc. The application even provides a facility for the user to suggest the right station position in case of misplaced stations.\n\nThe application receives price data several times per day from the Greek Fuel Prices Observatory (an official Greek state service). As a result the fuel station owners are the only responsible for the data accuracy displayed by the application, excluding geolocation and telephone numbers which are added by the fuelGR team.\n\nPermissions Information:\n\n- The application uses your location for all spatial services mentioned. You can disable it if you are concerned but you will lose all the related functionality."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for seeing the difference in elevation of two points. Great for hiking and other outdoor activities. The Compass shows your real-time orientation in this elevation app.\n\n5-Star Reviews:\n\"I love this app, wherever I go snowmobiling or hiking I always use it.\"\n\n\"This app really works well. I enjoy checking the altitude wherever I am. Nice!\"\n\nA simple and uncluttered interface to read:\n• Altitude or Elevation\n• Latitude\n• Longitude\n\nFeatures\n• Highest GPS accuracy for your device\n• Ground elevation from topographical map values\n• View in feet or meters\n• Built-in flashlight\n\nSharing\n• Share screenshots with beautiful backgrounds\n• Share on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, or text message\n\nUse the Custom Background upgrade to take a photo from the top of a mountain and take a screenshot with your altitude overlaid to show your family & friends.\n\nBackgrounds (In-App purchases):\n• Meadow landscape (Illustrated)\n• Cityscape (Illustrated)\n• Mountains (Illustrated)\n• Abstract\n• Choose Your Own\n\nNote: Many customers with high altitude illnesses or sensitivities, such as chronic lung disease, asthma, COPD, & emphysema find this app useful for avoiding high altitudes. It is also used by hikers and climbers who want to avoid high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). However, the altitude shown is potentially subject to large inaccuracies and this app should NOT be used as a primary device for determining altitude for medical reasons."

Up to four dash cams can be wirelessly connected with the Dash Cam Auto Sync feature to provide comprehensive coverage around a vehicle, offering various viewpoints recorded by the multiple cameras. The Garmin Drive app can create a “picture-in-picture” video from any two perspectives at the same time, making it easy to review video and also share videos with friends, insurance agencies, or legal authorities.\r\n \r\nGarmin Speak™ and Garmin DriveSmart™ 65 with Amazon Alexa are two Garmin products that bring what you love about Amazon Alexa to your vehicle. Just ask Alexa to hear music, news, and more. Also, enjoy Garmin turn-by-turn navigation. Stream the audio (music and other responses) from your vehicle’s stereo when you connect Garmin Speak to your stereo using Bluetooth® or AUX.\r\n \r\nOlder Bluetooth-capable Garmin navigators are compatible with the Garmin Smartphone Link app, and older Wi-Fi-enabled Garmin dash cams can access video footage through the Garmin VIRB app."

By popular demand I have re-designed, re-architected, and re-published the App as a new generational version in the App Store.\n\nWatch APRS expands beyond the original by offering not only new reliable connections to APRS Tier 2 servers across the world but also many new features being built to improve your overall experience.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n* Live monitoring of APRS traffic and packets based on GPS location\n* Live data analytics on APRS packets such as Average Outdoor Temperatures from weather telemetry data\n* Interactive mapping of APRS packets using your device's included Apple Maps feature\n* Improved UX/UI (User Interface and Experience) to view data from several types of APRS packets within the App\n* Improved connection reliability with APRS Servers including when the App is put into the background and resumed from Sleep\n* Can handle thousands of packets and millions of bytes of data in a single App session\n* Industrial grade APRS packet parsing\n* Geocoding of APRS packet data to show location names on top of the actual GPS position\n* Re-built and re-coded with Microsoft .NET MAUI with a whole new back-end library and code to better deliver the data when you need it the most\n\nWe have decided to discontinue the Ad Free feature for the time being as we are re-building our entire code base and finding ways to better support development. Thank you for your continued support of the ongoing development of the Watch APRS App. As a courtesy we have enabled the APRS transmission feature for all users to allow you to transmit your phone's location with a valid amateur radio license and call sign to the APRS servers."

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

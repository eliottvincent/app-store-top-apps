You can also filter out the received data based on the desired brand, fuel type and price age. Fuel types supported are petrol (all types), diesel (all types), liquid gas (LPG) and natural gas (CNG).\n\nThe application is THE ONLY ONE with manually verified fuel station positions (for >93% of the fuel stations). This allows services like Google Street View pictures for the stations, estimation of distance to a station, navigation guidance, etc. The application even provides a facility for the user to suggest the right station position in case of misplaced stations.\n\nThe application receives price data several times per day from the Greek Fuel Prices Observatory (an official Greek state service). As a result the fuel station owners are the only responsible for the data accuracy displayed by the application, excluding geolocation and telephone numbers which are added by the fuelGR team.\n\nPermissions Information:\n\n- The application uses your location for all spatial services mentioned.

The Compass shows your real-time orientation in this elevation app.\n\n5-Star Reviews:\n\"I love this app, wherever I go snowmobiling or hiking I always use it.\"\n\n\"This app really works well. I enjoy checking the altitude wherever I am. Nice!\"\n\nA simple and uncluttered interface to read:\n• Altitude or Elevation\n• Latitude\n• Longitude\n\nFeatures\n• Highest GPS accuracy for your device\n• Ground elevation from topographical map values\n• View in feet or meters\n• Built-in flashlight\n\nSharing\n• Share screenshots with beautiful backgrounds\n• Share on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, or text message\n\nUse the Custom Background upgrade to take a photo from the top of a mountain and take a screenshot with your altitude overlaid to show your family & friends.\n\nBackgrounds (In-App purchases):\n• Meadow landscape (Illustrated)\n• Cityscape (Illustrated)\n• Mountains (Illustrated)\n• Abstract\n• Choose Your Own\n\nNote: Many customers with high altitude illnesses or sensitivities, such as chronic lung disease, asthma, COPD, & emphysema find this app useful for avoiding high altitudes. It is also used by hikers and climbers who want to avoid high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). However, the altitude shown is potentially subject to large inaccuracies and this app should NOT be used as a primary device for determining altitude for medical reasons."

      "label": "Help flatten the curve by avoiding public transport and switching to bikes instead!\n\nWienMobil Rad (formerly Citybike Wien) is a bike-sharing service provided by nextbike, where you can borrow bikes for one hour free of charge. It's the cheapest and most eco-friendly choice to travel around Vienna.\nThere are currently more than 100 nextbike bike stations throughout Vienna, which are available around the clock (24/7). You can rent or return a bike at any time at one of the many nextbike stations.\n\nCity bikes have been in Vienna for over 15 years and although scooters are said to be the new hype, bicycles in Vienna still have clear advantages:\n1. City bikes can be rented very cheaply.\n2. Although scooters claim to be eco-friendly, only city bikes are truly eco-friendly as they don't need a motor and therefore don't need to be charged or refueled.\n3. Since they don't have to be recharged overnight, you can really rent a city bike at any time. Day and night, 7 days a week.\n4. You can return your rental bike to any station that has a free box and thus keep the sidewalks free of parked bicycles.\n\nThis app provides you with current data on available bikes and available boxes in your area. Just take a look at the app and find everything at a glance:\n▸ A map with all nextbike (formerly Citybike Vienna) stations.\n▸ Each station is visualized by a marker with 2 numbers: available bikes and available boxes.\n▸ Real-time updates of all stations as soon as a bike is rented or returned.\n▸ Find the nearest bike stations in your area.\n▸ Street View: Find stations in an interactive 360-degree view.\n▸ Distances: Determines the exact distance as well as walking time and cycling time to the desired station.\n▸ Directions: Let the route to a city bike station be calculated.\n▸ Start an interactive visualization to see the utilization of all Citybike stations within the last 60 minutes in fast motion. This also creates heat maps (heatmaps) with the most visited stations.\n▸ Clearly recognizable markings when there are no bicycles available at a station or when there are no more free boxes.\n▸ All important weather information at a glance: Current weather conditions, temperature, wind speed and more!\n\nHopefully the bike will soon become your preferred mode of transport in Vienna, whether you're planning a sightseeing tour, running errands or just going for a little bike ride with your friends. And the best part? It's environmentally friendly! #FridaysForFuture #bike sharing\n\nNote: This app is a private project and not a product of Citybike Wien ™, Gewista Werbeges.m.b.H., nextbike or WienMobil.\nThe developer assumes no liability for the correctness, completeness or timeliness of the data and the service."

High resolution vector charts are available by In App Purchase (IAP) including updates for 12 months.\n\nVector charts provide many advantages over traditional raster charts. Buoys, Lights, Bridges, Depth Contours, Depth Soundings, Rocks, Anchorage areas, NOAA Weather Buoys etc. are all selectable and have real time distance, bearing and detail information. Turn off layers to de-clutter the display and only show what is important at the time. Tides, moon and sun times and weather are also all available at your fingertips. \n\nIn-app tools let you measure distances and bearings and record waypoints on routes to sail. When you are out at sea, the app’s Sailing HUD shows your position on the route, Course over ground (COG), Speed over ground (SOG), Vector Made Good (VMG), Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), Distance and bearing to next Waypoint. Waypoint reached alerts, auto-routing to the next waypoint and flashing collision alerts (with AIS). \n\nUnique AR view mode (IAP) allows you to view buoys, lights, ships, waypoints, route and track overlaid on your iPhone or iPad live camera view. With \"AR LockOn\" you can select a target on the chart and then be guided to it in the AR camera view.  You can also see at night and in the fog with the FLIRONE Infra-red camera.\n\nExternal NMEA GPS, AIS and Wind data over Wifi.\n\nRequirements: \nGPS only required for real time route navigation.

Rediscover the international ski area around the Matterhorn, using the intuitive 3D map.\n\nGPS navigation in the ski area on a 3D map\nThe centrepiece of the app is the navigation function on the 3D map. Should you want to reach your favourite mountain restaurant from one of the valley stations, the app will indicate the right lifts and pistes as well as the time required to get there. The journey time depends on your personal level of ability, which can be set in the app.\n\nMore features\nThe app always takes account of the opening times of ski runs and lifts in the ski area, provided that the mobile device is connected to the internet. This should not pose a problem since all Zermatt Bergbahnen AG stations are equipped with free wireless LAN.\n\nVirtuality meets reality -- The mixed-reality feature known as “User Perspective BETA” fuses reality and virtuality to offer a virtual 3D experience.\n\nIn addition, the app features a detailed mountain restaurant guide, so you can also enjoy Matterhorn ski paradise from its culinary side. Current opening times, detailed information and various filter functions will help find the perfect restaurant beside the ski runs.\n\nOther features you’ll find on the app:\n•\tup-to-the-minute weather forecasts, showing webcam views\n•\talerts to any imminent dangers\n•\tlink to Zermatt Bergbahnen’s web shop\n•\tattractive tour options\n•\tlink to Skiline: Your day’s skiing in figures\n\nWe wish you a lot of fun with your navigation buddy in the ski area and look forward to your feedback on app@matterhornparadise.ch.

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Adding a space you think others would find helpful is easy.

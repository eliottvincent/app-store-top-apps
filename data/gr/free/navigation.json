You can also filter out the received data based on the desired brand, fuel type and price age. Fuel types supported are petrol (all types), diesel (all types), liquid gas (LPG) and natural gas (CNG).\n\nThe application is THE ONLY ONE with manually verified fuel station positions (for >93% of the fuel stations). This allows services like Google Street View pictures for the stations, estimation of distance to a station, navigation guidance, etc. The application even provides a facility for the user to suggest the right station position in case of misplaced stations.\n\nThe application receives price data several times per day from the Greek Fuel Prices Observatory (an official Greek state service). As a result the fuel station owners are the only responsible for the data accuracy displayed by the application, excluding geolocation and telephone numbers which are added by the fuelGR team.\n\nPermissions Information:\n\n- The application uses your location for all spatial services mentioned.

      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "MiraTrex PRO CHARTS™ is a powerful, yet easy-to-use marine navigation system. Whether you’re a fisherman, weekend cruiser, sailor, diver, jet-skier, or an offshore captain needing to find an exact location hundreds of miles offshore, PRO CHARTS™ will get you there and back home safely – with nothing more than your iPhone or iPad.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n• High-resolution NOAA nautical chart coverage with depths for all U.S. coastal areas, the Great Lakes, major U.S. river systems, and Brazil plus global high-level nautical charts. Charts are automatically updated based on NOAA chart corrections.\n\n• Easy one-touch Waypoint and Route creation. Pre-plan your routes at home or create them at sea with equal ease. Just touch the screen to create new waypoints and routes.\n\n• Find your friends on the water. With our new Buddy-tracking feature, you can see and meet up with your friends while you’re out on the water. If you’re on your secret spot and don’t want to be seen, you can hide your location with the touch of a button.\n\n• Stay safe. Easily create and send a Float Plan of your trip to a friend or family member. Your Float Plan and location history can be forwarded to search and rescue personnel in case of an emergency.\n\n• Easy point-and-steer navigation. The red heading bug on the large on-screen compass always directs you to the next point on your route. Navigation is as easy as pointing your boat at the heading bug to stay on course.\n\n• No Network. No Problem. PRO CHARTS™ is designed so no internet connection is required to view your charts while out on the water. You simply download in advance any charts you’ll need at sea with the touch of a button.\n\n• Record your tracks. Track your position in real-time and later view your track history.\n\n• Fully indexed point of interest (POI) database including weather, aids to navigation (markers and lights), obstructions, tides, currents, your buddies, and more.\n\n\nWebsite: www.miratrex.com\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nPlans:\n\nBase app with limited features - Free \n14 day trial of all premium features - Free\nAll premium features (Monthly) - $2.99\nAll premium features (Annual) - $29.99 (Save 16%, about 2 months free)\n\n\n\n-Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n-Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n-You will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for that product.\n\n-You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the Apple Settings app after purchase.\n\n-No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period. This does not affect your statutory rights.\n\n-Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.\n\n-We will be collecting information about your use of the app both when you are online and offline.

Though PRO CHARTS™ will function without a GPS as a chart reader, a GPS-enabled device is required for point-to-point navigation. Third-party Bluetooth GPS units are available to enable GPS for iOS devices such as WiFi-only iPads that do not include a GPS receiver. For offline use where no Internet connection is available, charts must be pre-cached while still on-line and connected, any charts downloaded while online will be available for offline use."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit.

In-App purchase can be used to remove the bottom advertisement and to support us.\n\nThis application does not need an internet connection and works best in outdoors.\n\nBy default, it uses device sensor to determine the elevation from see level, but you also have the option to use NOAA data files to get the altitude of your location. On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

All widgets work in regular or head-up display (HUD) mode. \n\nSpeedometers:\n— Classic digital speedometer\n— Digital, with compass, odometer, and distance traveled (Chevrolet Aveo style)\n— A set of retro speedometers: Cadillac style, arched, circular\n\nGPS trip information:\n— See how safely you drive: the app calculates your driving score based on your acceleration, braking, turns, and speeding data. \n— Know your fuel consumption per each trip and the expenses on it.\n— Information on your current, maximum and average speed, distance and time traveled\n— Large compass\n— Eco-driving. Acceleration and deceleration graphs indicate driving efficiency\n\nOther:\n— Internet Radio\n— Land meter. Indicates the angle of car slope or tilt — pitching and rolling\n— Weather and clock\n\nLaunch the app, select the widget, and place the smartphone close to the windshield (to use it in HUD mode, with the screen image reflected onto the windshield), or fix it in the mount. \n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (more at hudwayglass.com or see bellow). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. Continuous use of geolocation services (GPS and GLONASS) may drain your device battery fast.\n\n3. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nHUDWAY Glass car accessory makes smartphone work as a head-up display in any car even in daytime. Removes doubling, offers sharp enlarged reflection image.\nLearn more: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

      "label": "HYPERDIA is a train timetable application that allows you to search using natural language spoken queries in either English or Japanese. For example, try a query like \"Narita Airport to Shibuya station, last train.\" The search parameters will be set automatically, providing quick access to the train timetable information you are looking for.  This can be particularly handy if you are a foreigner traveling in Japan for the first time, or simply prefer to see timetable information in English.\n\n=====================================\n[Jul 12, 2017 UPDATE]\nWe supported for 64bit architecture. \n=====================================\n\n===Using Voice Search===\nThe English language voice search system supports \"Departure station\", \"Arrival station\", \"last train\", and \"first train\" input parameters.  You may also specify time information.\n\nThe voice search functionality helps to eliminate otherwise difficult and time-consuming text input, particularly when entering the names of Japanese train stations. Voice search is also useful when you are in a hurry, or when it's awkward to input text using the built-in keypad.\n\nStations with similar pronunciations will appear as alternative candidates, making it easy to select your desired station.\n\nThe application also supports telephone-style usage. You can simply lift the phone to your ear and speak your query as if you were having a normal telephone conversation.\n\nOf course, it is also possible to specify your search parameters using the built-in keypad without using the voice functionality.\n\n===Route Search===\nSearch for all JR lines, private lines, subways, streetcars and airports is supported.\n\nInformation including the shortest route, fares, commuter fares, and links to time information and maps is shown.\n\nIt is possible to filter results based on plane routes, shinkansen, and rapid lines, as well as JR versus private railways.\n\n===Japanese version===\nBoth English and Japanese versions of the system are available. This allows the user to search the same set of nationwide Japanese stations in either English or Japanese using text or voice input. Note that the English-language voice system is tailored to American English accents.\n\n\n===30 days Free Trial===\nThe trial version of the application can be used for free for 30 days, starting from the first usage following installation.\n\nAt any time during or after the end of the 30 days trial period, you may purchase a usage coupon to continue using the application and enable the full set of available features.\n\n===Coupon===\nIn order to use HYPERDIA after the free trial period, it is necessary to obtain a coupon by making an In App purchase.\n\nFour different types of coupons are available. (Prices subject to change.)\n  * Japanese (1 month) - $1.99\n  * Japanese (1 year)  - $16.99\n  * Japanese + English (1 month) - $2.99\n  * Japanese + English (1 year)  - $25.99\n\nPlease be aware that if you purchase a \"Japanese + English\" coupon when you already have a valid \"Japanese\" coupon, the \"Japanese\" coupon will become invalid. \n\nWARNING:\nIn order to use this application, a stable Internet connection (3G, WiFi, etc.) is required.\n\nPlease note that, although great care and effort have been taken in the development of this application, it is possible, due to circumstances beyond our control, that fare and/or time information may occasionally be incorrect."

It has been designed to help guide travelers on their road tours in the area, also showing routes in natural surroundings, while it ensures a comfortable and safe trip even in areas without mobile internet coverage. \n\nUsers have the possibility to:\n\n•\tEasily find their current position on the map, through the GPS function of their mobile device\n•\tProject the Points of Interest (POIs) on the map and find a detailed description for each one of them\n•\tDirect and easy transfer between the tourist map of Central Greece and the hiking map of Mount Telethrio. \n\nMAP OF THE REGION OF CENTRAL GREECE\n\nThe app is installed with the map of the Region of Central Greece, showing information corresponding to a 1:200.000 scale. It includes all towns, villages, municipalities, the entire main road network with different types of roads, and all the new roads. In this map, users may also find information, according to scale, on points of interest (main archaeological sites, monasteries, ski resorts, airports, ports, mountain refuges, spa centers etc.), beaches, rivers and lakes. There is a color grade on the background so as to better depict the relief of each area on the map.\n\nMAP OF MOUNT TELETHRIO IN EVIA\t\n\nThe app is also installed with the map of Mount Telethrio, which appears for the first time and includes very detailed information corresponding to a 1:25.000 scale. Mount Telethrio was mapped starting from scratch. All trails, roads, springs, waterfalls and other points of interest were thoroughly recorded through extensive field survey and all point-to-point distances are shown in detail. Also shown are the surrounding main access roads leading to the mountain, so as to make the visit easier for the traveler. All towns and villages are accurately marked. Contour lines have also been added as well as a relief shading to better depict the relief of each area of the map."

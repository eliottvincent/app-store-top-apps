You can also filter out the received data based on the desired brand, fuel type and price age. Fuel types supported are petrol (all types), diesel (all types), liquid gas (LPG) and natural gas (CNG).\n\nThe application is THE ONLY ONE with manually verified fuel station positions (for >93% of the fuel stations). This allows services like Google Street View pictures for the stations, estimation of distance to a station, navigation guidance, etc. The application even provides a facility for the user to suggest the right station position in case of misplaced stations.\n\nThe application receives price data several times per day from the Greek Fuel Prices Observatory (an official Greek state service). As a result the fuel station owners are the only responsible for the data accuracy displayed by the application, excluding geolocation and telephone numbers which are added by the fuelGR team.\n\nPermissions Information:\n\n- The application uses your location for all spatial services mentioned.

Δημιουργήθηκε με σκοπό οι χρήστες να έχουν την δυνατότητα να σταθμεύουν εύκολα και γρήγορα, αγοράζοντας εισιτήρια/κάρτες ελεγχόμενης στάθμευσης μέσα από την εφαρμογή χωρίς να χρειάζεται να ψάχνουν για σημεία πώλησης εντύπων καρτών ελεγχόμενης στάθμευσης. \nΗ εφαρμογή χρησιμοποιεί την τοποθεσία του χρήστη μέσω GPS, αν ο χρήστης το επιτρέψει, για ευκολία καταχώρησης του εισιτηρίου του. Η εφαρμογή μπορεί να λειτουργήσει και χωρίς αυτήν την αποδοχή, ο χρήστης όμως θα πρέπει να επιλέξει το ορθό σημείο στάθμευσης καθώς με βάση αυτό γίνεται ο έλεγχος νομιμότητας στάθμευσης από την αρμόδια δημοτική υπηρεσία. Στην περίπτωση που δεν είναι σωστό το σημείο στάθμευσης ενδέχεται να εκδοθεί διοικητικό πρόστιμο.\nΗ λειτουργία του συστήματος χρονικού περιορισμού στάθμευσης γίνεται με ηλεκτρονικό εισιτήριο αξίας 30 λεπτών για μια ή δύο ώρες στάθμευσης.\nΜετά την παρέλευση του χρονικού ορίου υποχρεούστε να μετακινήσετε το όχημα εκτός της περιοχής μεγίστου ορίου στάθμευσης, αφού δεν θα έχει ξανά το δικαίωμα να σταθμεύσει το όχημα εντός της ημέρας στην ελεγχόμενη στάθμευση του Δήμου Πάτρας."

Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Rediscover the international ski area around the Matterhorn, using the intuitive 3D map.\n\nGPS navigation in the ski area on a 3D map\nThe centrepiece of the app is the navigation function on the 3D map. Should you want to reach your favourite mountain restaurant from one of the valley stations, the app will indicate the right lifts and pistes as well as the time required to get there. The journey time depends on your personal level of ability, which can be set in the app.\n\nMore features\nThe app always takes account of the opening times of ski runs and lifts in the ski area, provided that the mobile device is connected to the internet. This should not pose a problem since all Zermatt Bergbahnen AG stations are equipped with free wireless LAN.\n\nVirtuality meets reality -- The mixed-reality feature known as “User Perspective BETA” fuses reality and virtuality to offer a virtual 3D experience.\n\nIn addition, the app features a detailed mountain restaurant guide, so you can also enjoy Matterhorn ski paradise from its culinary side. Current opening times, detailed information and various filter functions will help find the perfect restaurant beside the ski runs.\n\nOther features you’ll find on the app:\n•\tup-to-the-minute weather forecasts, showing webcam views\n•\talerts to any imminent dangers\n•\tlink to Zermatt Bergbahnen’s web shop\n•\tattractive tour options\n•\tlink to Skiline: Your day’s skiing in figures\n\nWe wish you a lot of fun with your navigation buddy in the ski area and look forward to your feedback on app@matterhornparadise.ch. This will help us with ongoing improvements to the Skiguide app in response to your needs."

      "label": "\"Gives you the best route to where you want to go\" - New York Times\n“You won't realize how much time you can save planning until you use this app” - LA Times\n“Killer app” - WSJ \n\"MBTA has a favorite transit app — and it's called Transit\" - Boston Globe\n\nTransit is your real-time urban travel companion. Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here. Honestly, these guys should be in charge of actual public transportation itself.\"\n\nCITIES\nTransit works in 200+ cities across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand (see USA list below).\n\nUSA\nAlbuquerque \nAnn Arbor\nAspen\nAtlanta*\nAustin*\nBaltimore (MTA*, RTA, Charm City Circulator*)\nBoston (MBTA*, Massport, MetroWest RTA, Brockton Area Transit (BAT), Lowell RTA, Plymouth & Brockton S.

On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

The distance will count down as you approach your destination.\n5) Tap the button next to the distance to open the photo location on a map or copy the coordinates.\n\nKeep in mind this app only works with photos that have EXIF location data. Not all apps save location data with photos, and the Camera app will only save location data if you have granted it access to your location.\n\nThis app also relies on the accuracy of your device's GPS and compass sensors, as well as the accuracy of location and altitude data when the photo was taken. There can be significant error in all these measurements, so accuracy of the app is limited by these factors. Photo Find works best for navigating outdoors to photos that were taken outdoors with good GPS reception."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

      "label": "With our app, measuring the area of spaces is even easier. \n\nOne measuring option is just to start the app and walk around a space to measure the area on foot. This is the easiest method to use if you simply need square footage. \nThe other measuring option involves a little more planning. Sit on your comfy sofa, start our app, and in the custom map view, manually select the points/area to measure. This can come in handy if you want to measure your plot of land, or a physical area for future investment. On the other hand, if you are a farmer and you want to know the area of your planting fields, it's a great option for you as well. After taking the measurements, you can share them with your coworkers or friends.\nThe app is extremely useful for a large number of specialists in various fields.\n\nRecommendations\nExternal Bluetooth GPS receiver is recommended if your built-in receiver is not accurate enough. We specifically recommend GARMIN GLO and GARMIN GLO 2 which gives the accuracy up to 0.3 m.  \n\nOur app can also come in handy when measuring distances, so if you are a runner, or you are planning a hiking trip, there’s nothing simpler than measuring the distances of your adventure with our app!\n\nOur measurement algorithms are very accurate. They use both GPS positioning and a network connection to make your measurements even more accurate. \n\nSome of the measurements include:\n- Field area measurement in meters², kilometers², feet², nmi², yards² and acres.\n- Distance measurement in meters, kilometers, nautical miles, feet & miles, yards\n- Elevation\n- Latitude and longitude in formats:\n- decimal degrees\n- degrees, decimal minutes\n- degrees, minutes, seconds\n- UTM\n\nApplication is useful for:\n- Land surveyors\n- City planners\n- Farmers\n- Landscape designers\n- Construction surveys\n- Facilities mapping\n- Construction sites and building sites area\n- Farm fencing\n\nImportant!: The accuracy of the application depends on the GPS sensor accuracy in a device - on most devices the accuracy is within +/- 5m. To improve accuracy, we encourage you to use more a precise GPS receiver, such as Garmin which provides accuracy to a few cm.\n\n\r\nPrivacy policy: https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/mygpsareacalculator\t\r\nTerms and conditions: https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/mygpsareacalculator"

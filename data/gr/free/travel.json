Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others.

Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware.

SBB Mobile can do it all. And much more. \n \nThe heart of the app is the new navigation bar with the following menu points and content.  \n\nPlan  \n• Plan your journey with a simple timetable search via the touch timetable or use your current position as the origin or destination, locating it on the map.  \n• Buy your ticket for the whole of Switzerland in just two clicks. Your travelcards on the SwissPass are applied. \n• Travel particularly affordably with supersaver tickets or Saver Day Passes. \n\nTrips \n• Save your trip and we will provide you with all the information you need during your journey under ‘Single Trips’: everything from departure and arrival times, platform information and service disruptions to train formations and walking routes.  \n• Set up your personal commuter route under ‘Commuting’ and receive push notifications about rail service disruptions. \n• The app accompanies you from door to door as you travel and you will receive information about delays, disruption and interchange times via push notification.  \n\nEasyRide \n• Check in, hop on and head off – across the entire GA Travelcard network. \n• EasyRide calculates the right ticket for your journey on the basis of the routes you travelled and charges you the relevant amount subsequently. \n \nTickets & Travelcards  \n• Show your public transport travelcards digitally with SwissPass Mobile. \n• It also gives you an overview of your valid and expired tickets and travelcards on the SwissPass. \n\nShop & Services  \n• Buy regional transport tickets and Day Passes for the GA Travelcard area of validity quickly and easily without searching the timetable.  \n• In the ‘Services’ section, you can find lots of useful links about travel. \n\nProfile  \n•  Straightforward access to your personal settings and our customer support.  \n\nContact us. \nIf you have any questions, feel free to get in touch: \n \nhttps://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile/contact.html \n \nData security and authorisations. \nWhat permissions does SBB Mobile need and why? \n \nLocation \nFor connections from your current location, the GPS function must be activated so that SBB Mobile can find the nearest stop. This also applies if you want to have the nearest stop displayed in the timetable. \n \nCalendar and e-mail \nYou can save connections in your own calendar and send them by e-mail (to friends, an external calendar). SBB Mobile requires read and write permissions to be able to import your desired connection into the calendar. \n \nAccess to the camera \nSBB Mobile requires access to your camera to take pictures directly in the app for your personalised touch timetable.  \n\nInternet access \nSBB Mobile requires internet access to search the timetable as well as for ticket purchases. \n \nMemory \nTo support offline functions, e.g. station/stop list, connections (history) and purchased tickets, SBB Mobile requires access to your device’s memory (saving app-specific settings)."

      "label": "Thousands of cars at your fingertips. With SHARE NOW, you'll always have a car in your city. Just like with car2go and DriveNow, our premium cars free-float around major city centres, making it easy for you to hop into the first one that catches your eye. Car-sharing is a new way of car rental, with no rental offices, no paperwork and no waiting around. Parking and fuelling/charging are free. All the perks of owning your own car – no strings attached. Rent a car the easy way. That's the SHARE NOW car-sharing app.\n\nWith SHARE NOW car-sharing, there are no annual or monthly fees for members. You can do everything you need to rent a car digitally via this smartphone app, including registration, unlocking and locking cars, payment and even the validation of your driver’s licence. That’s why we believe car-sharing is the future of urban mobility.\n\nSHARE NOW car-sharing is perfect for...\n\n• SPONTANEOUS TRIPS\nThis is car-sharing as you know it best: super short spontaneous trips for shopping, commuting and getting from A to B in your city. Find, reserve, and unlock SHARE NOW cars in less than two seconds. When you're done, simply park the car anywhere in the Home Area of your city. It’s as simple as that.\n\n• WEEKEND ROAD TRIPS\nGot plans? You can rent our free-floating cars at hourly rates. We also do medium-length road trips from just a single day to a whole weekend - get out into nature or visit your favourite shopping outlet. You’re in charge.\n\n• WEEK-LONG CAR RENTAL\nCar-sharing is also ideal for longer trips of up to 30 days for holiday travel. You can keep a car for yourself for longer (you pay per km) and take the stress of out renting a car. Roam freely outside of the Home Area and adventure beyond the city limits. We also offer pre-booking for longer trips. Tell us when and where you want your car – and we'll take care of the rest.\n\n• AIRPORT ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE\nWhether you’re catching a flight or have just landed, our cars are available at several major airports in Europe's top destinations, with dedicated parking at many locations. Car-sharing is cheaper than taxis and you never have to wait in line - just open the SHARE NOW app and reserve a car in a few taps. That’s one less thing to worry about.\n\n• BUSINESS TRIPS\nCar-sharing offers you a comfortable and cost-effective way to travel for business – with premium cars and convenient corporate invoicing. Manage all your colleagues' travel expenses in one easy admin dashboard. This is corporate car rental like never before.\n\n• CORPORATE PERKS\nCar-sharing is an affordable corporate mobility perk for your company. Offer your teams access to car-sharing and provide a comfortable way for your employees to travel for business. SHARE NOW Mobility Allowance lets you award car-sharing credit to individual employees via a single corporate account.\n\n• EARN REWARDS\nEarn points just by driving with SHARE NOW Rewards. As you level up, you’ll unlock perks and partner deals such as Bonus Reservation Time and Hourly Rates, VIP Customer Support, a Birthday Voucher and Overnight Reservation. We’ve partnered with like-minded companies to bring you special offers from those who care as much as we do about sharing. SHARE NOW Rewards is completely free to join.\n\n• INVITE FRIENDS\nInvite friends by sending them a personal code via messenger apps, such as WhatsApp, or via email or SMS. If they sign up using your promo code, you'll each earn free driving credits - it’s a win-win!\n\n\nEnjoy the largest electric car-sharing fleet in Europe with SHARE NOW. Our mission: to grow our electric fleet every year. Join the mobility movement now.\n\n\nDISCOVER CAR-SHARING IN YOUR CITY NOW:\nSHARE NOW is available in 16 major cities in 8 countries in Europe including Amsterdam, Berlin, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart,  Madrid, Milan, Rome, Turin, Paris, Vienna, Budapest and Copenhagen."

Always!\n\nBut in more practical terms:\n• To be part of a community trying to be more sustainable through less owning products and more sharing.\n• When you realize the cost associated with owning your own bike or leasing from a regular bike-lease company.\n• When you have a flat tire or broken lights. Don’t wait for repairs, hop on to a nearby Donkey bike with our app.\n• When you’re visiting other towns, simply open the app and see if we are there.\n• When guests visit you, share your love for biking with them.\n\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I rent more than one bike at once?\nYes, you can rent up to 5 bikes at once! Just make sure to select the correct number of vehicles right at the beginning of your booking process.\n\nCan I leave the bike anywhere?\nNo. We work hard with the cities to keep the streets clean and accessible for everyone. Please return your Donkeys to specific drop-off locations when you are done for the day.\n\nWhat if I have issues?\nOur support team is always happy to help and understands that life happens.\n\n\nHOW PRICING WORKS\n\nJust Ride (Pay as you go)\nWith no strings attached. Just Ride is ideal for trips from 15 mins to a few hours. You can also top up your Donkey Wallet with money and we will give you bonus credit that you can use for Just Riding.\n\nDay Deals\nIn some cities, we have rolled out day deals which are great for when you just need a bike for the 1,2,3, or up to 7 days. Visiting for a weekend or inspired to explore like a local when you're on vacation? This is the perfect solution for you or a guest visiting you. \n\nMonthly memberships\nWith a Donkey membership, you pay a fixed monthly fee and get a certain amount of free time per day. If you exceed the included daily free time, your rental is extended for a low fixed cost. Ideal for the daily commute and for a busy city life with multiple errands throughout the day. Valid in all Donkey cities.\n\n\nCYCLING IS OUR PASSION\n\nWe are a team of 40(ish) firm believers in cycling as the most efficient mode of transportation and the only one our cities need. We work by the rule that any decision we make will have to bring us closer to being a sustainable, affordable, and reliable mobility provider. We wish to show the world that cycling can make cities more liveable and bike-sharing will help in that transformation.\n\nDonkey Republic - Every ride counts"

      "label": "9292 travels with 2 million travellers every month\nThanks to the travel planner of 9292, you can plan all your trips with the train, bus, metro, tram, and ferry. Need to travel by bicycle, electric bicycle / scooter or a rental bike? We can include that in your travel advice. Enter your trip from A to B and we will immediately show you up-to-date travel information for all public transport in the Netherlands. And the app is prepared for showing Flex-OV such as the watertaxi in Rotterdam. In case of any changes, we will show you an alternative travel advice automatically. The up-to-date public transport planner provides live public transport info for NS, Arriva, Connexxion, Breng, Hermes, Keolis, RRReis, Qbuzz, EBS, U-OV, RET, HTM, GVB and Waterbus.\n\nE-ticket for the entire journey\nYou can buy e-tickets straight from the travel advice in the 9292 app. The affiliated public transport services for bus, tram, metro and ferry are Breng, Connexxion, EBS, Hermes, HTM, Keolis, RET, U-OV and Waterbus. For all national trains, these are NS, Blauwnet, Qbuzz, Connexxion, Arriva and Keolis.\n\nMusic on the go\nPlan your journey in the 9292 app. At the bottom of the travel advice of your choice you will see the button \"Playlist for this trip\". This will take you to the Playlist Generator. On this page we create a playlist based on the travel time of your chosen travel advice. Log in to your Spotify account and we place the created playlist in the library of your Spotify account, so that you can easily find it and enjoy your music during your trip.\n\nOccupancy expectation\nDuring these times, it is important to take into account how crowded the train, bus, tram or metro service is for your travel plans. The 9292 app displays the expected occupancy per mode of transport for each travel advice, as communicated to us by the transport services.\n\nBicycle pre- and post-journey\nUnder ‘Options’, you can indicate if you want to walk, cycle or ride a scooter at the start or end of  your trip. This will give you the most complete advice with all relevant information for travelling from A to B. You can also opt for an electric bicycle or rental bicycle. To make it even easier, we also show you bicycle rental locations if you select bicycle. Very useful for covering the last bit to your final destination!\n\nFrom/to\nThe app has multiple options for selecting your location of departure or arrival: your ‘current location’ (via GPS), a known location (shopping mall, station or attraction), an address or bus stop, your contacts, and even your frequently or recently used locations.\n\nUnique starting screen\nEnter your favourite locations and routes on the starting screen by using the plus-sign. This turns the 9292-app into your own personal app for quickly planning your trip from A to B, without needing an account. You can also add a bus stop or station you frequently use to your starting screen this way. Now you will always have access to the up-to-date departure times of that stop.\n\nSave travel advice\nWant to save a specific travel advice? You can! Simply use the plus-sign in the top right corner of the travel advice. You can find your saved travel advice by using the menu in the app.\n\nRoute on the map\nThe travel advice shows you a map with the route of that advice. Press on this and you will see the travel advice step by step on a detailed map. Now you can swipe through your entire trip!"

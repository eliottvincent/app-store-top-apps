Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

      "label": "Just buy one of our eSIM travel mobile data packs at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) for over 190+ countries and regions globally to enjoy global connectivity. Add a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and never worry about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM-compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM for whatever local carriers exist in the country you’re currently in, but without this old-school plastic SIM card you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIM is a true technological revolution and we bring it right into your eSIM compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or pay for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your own phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store for your convenience. Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find an updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link: https://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to get connected during their travels - it doesn't matter whether you're a seafarer, flight crew, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries -  We are here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more enormous roaming data fees\n* Installation in 2 minutes or less\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your number as you travel\n* No more fumbling to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky Wi-Fi dongle around\n\nHow does it work?\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM You can install your eSIM directly or by scanning a QR code or manually inserting an activation code provided. You can also manage and top-up your eSIMs with your Airalo account.\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fragile, tiny hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things easier for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees. \n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

      "label": "9292 travels with 2 million travellers every month\nThanks to the travel planner of 9292, you can plan all your trips with the train, bus, metro, tram, and ferry. Need to travel by bicycle, electric bicycle / scooter or a rental bike? We can include that in your travel advice. Enter your trip from A to B and we will immediately show you up-to-date travel information for all public transport in the Netherlands. And the app is prepared for showing Flex-OV such as the watertaxi in Rotterdam. In case of any changes, we will show you an alternative travel advice automatically. The up-to-date public transport planner provides live public transport info for NS, Arriva, Connexxion, Breng, Hermes, Keolis, RRReis, Qbuzz, EBS, U-OV, RET, HTM, GVB and Waterbus.\n\nE-ticket for the entire journey\nYou can buy e-tickets straight from the travel advice in the 9292 app. The affiliated public transport services for bus, tram, metro and ferry are Breng, Connexxion, EBS, Hermes, HTM, Keolis, RET, U-OV and Waterbus. For all national trains, these are NS, Blauwnet, Qbuzz, Connexxion, Arriva and Keolis.\n\nMusic on the go\nPlan your journey in the 9292 app. At the bottom of the travel advice of your choice you will see the button \"Playlist for this trip\". This will take you to the Playlist Generator. On this page we create a playlist based on the travel time of your chosen travel advice. Log in to your Spotify account and we place the created playlist in the library of your Spotify account, so that you can easily find it and enjoy your music during your trip.\n\nOccupancy expectation\nDuring these times, it is important to take into account how crowded the train, bus, tram or metro service is for your travel plans. The 9292 app displays the expected occupancy per mode of transport for each travel advice, as communicated to us by the transport services.\n\nBicycle pre- and post-journey\nUnder ‘Options’, you can indicate if you want to walk, cycle or ride a scooter at the start or end of  your trip. This will give you the most complete advice with all relevant information for travelling from A to B. You can also opt for an electric bicycle or rental bicycle. To make it even easier, we also show you bicycle rental locations if you select bicycle. Very useful for covering the last bit to your final destination!\n\nFrom/to\nThe app has multiple options for selecting your location of departure or arrival: your ‘current location’ (via GPS), a known location (shopping mall, station or attraction), an address or bus stop, your contacts, and even your frequently or recently used locations.\n\nUnique starting screen\nEnter your favourite locations and routes on the starting screen by using the plus-sign. This turns the 9292-app into your own personal app for quickly planning your trip from A to B, without needing an account. You can also add a bus stop or station you frequently use to your starting screen this way. Now you will always have access to the up-to-date departure times of that stop.\n\nSave travel advice\nWant to save a specific travel advice? You can! Simply use the plus-sign in the top right corner of the travel advice. You can find your saved travel advice by using the menu in the app.\n\nRoute on the map\nThe travel advice shows you a map with the route of that advice. Press on this and you will see the travel advice step by step on a detailed map. Now you can swipe through your entire trip!"

Whether you need a quick ride, a bike for the entire day, or get a monthly membership, you will find the most flexible and affordable solutions with Donkey.\n\nFind the right way to ride for your needs:\n\n• Pay as you go\n• Day deals\n• Wallet\n• Monthly Plans (Memberships) \n\n\nEASY TO USE\n\nWe believe that every ride counts!\n\nSo we offer the most convenient and flexible bike-share service for visiting new cities and for everyday needs.\n\n• Simply download the app and create an account for free!\n• Find a Donkey at a virtual pick-up/drop-off point for maximum flexibility and convenience.\n• Enjoy your ride! \n• When you’re done, find a drop-off location on the map.\n• Bring the Donkey there, lock the bike and end your ride in the app.\n• App works in all cities we are present in.\n\n\nWHEN SHOULD I USE DONKEY REPUBLIC?\n\nIs that even a question? Always!\n\nBut in more practical terms:\n• To be part of a community trying to be more sustainable through less owning products and more sharing.\n• When you realize the cost associated with owning your own bike or leasing from a regular bike-lease company.\n• When you have a flat tire or broken lights. Don’t wait for repairs, hop on to a nearby Donkey bike with our app.\n• When you’re visiting other towns, simply open the app and see if we are there.\n• When guests visit you, share your love for biking with them.\n\n\nFAQs\n\nCan I rent more than one bike at once?\nYes, you can rent up to 5 bikes at once! Just make sure to select the correct number of vehicles right at the beginning of your booking process.\n\nCan I leave the bike anywhere?\nNo. We work hard with the cities to keep the streets clean and accessible for everyone. Please return your Donkeys to specific drop-off locations when you are done for the day.\n\nWhat if I have issues?\nOur support team is always happy to help and understands that life happens.\n\n\nHOW PRICING WORKS\n\nJust Ride (Pay as you go)\nWith no strings attached. Just Ride is ideal for trips from 15 mins to a few hours. You can also top up your Donkey Wallet with money and we will give you bonus credit that you can use for Just Riding.\n\nDay Deals\nIn some cities, we have rolled out day deals which are great for when you just need a bike for the 1,2,3, or up to 7 days. Visiting for a weekend or inspired to explore like a local when you're on vacation? This is the perfect solution for you or a guest visiting you. \n\nMonthly memberships\nWith a Donkey membership, you pay a fixed monthly fee and get a certain amount of free time per day. If you exceed the included daily free time, your rental is extended for a low fixed cost. Ideal for the daily commute and for a busy city life with multiple errands throughout the day. Valid in all Donkey cities.\n\n\nCYCLING IS OUR PASSION\n\nWe are a team of 40(ish) firm believers in cycling as the most efficient mode of transportation and the only one our cities need. We work by the rule that any decision we make will have to bring us closer to being a sustainable, affordable, and reliable mobility provider. We wish to show the world that cycling can make cities more liveable and bike-sharing will help in that transformation.\n\nDonkey Republic - Every ride counts"

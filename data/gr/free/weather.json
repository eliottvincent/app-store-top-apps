      "label": "Simple and beautiful rustic style Thermometer now in your iPhone or iPad.\n\nWhat people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:\n\n- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

You can also get alert services for the solar wind data, Kp index, and hemispheric power. These extra services can be purchased within the app.\n\nThe app also provides predicted and observed Kp index, solar wind data directly from DSCOVR, such as solar wind speed and magnetic field (Bz and Bt), and graphs with recent data to help you predict auroral activity as well as the hemispheric power for the last 6 hours.\n\nThe app focuses much on the activity right now, but we also added a 3 day Kp forecast which can give you a hint which days you could expect higher activity.

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

Always without ads! (See \"Pro Features\" at the end). No internet connection required, no data transmitted - runs on your device only!\n\nKeep an eye on the barometric pressure and be your own weather forecast! This little app uses only GPS (optional) and the new barometric pressure sensor to calculate the barometric pressure used in weather forecasts. The new iPhones have a barometric pressure sensor built in so this app works completely without internet. The handy marker helps you keep track of changes in the barometric pressure and let's you predict weather changes! Please realize, that a single barometric pressure reading is not enough to tell the current weather situation but the barometric pressure and its change over time is a very good indicator for weather changes!\n\nNow you can also see the trend in barometric pressure with graph charts displaying the measurements taken during the last 30 days! (6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d)\n\nThe Altimeter helps you track your altitude changes based on the change of pressure. Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for checking how high up the mountain you have climbed (works for other activities too). The App does not use GPS for the Altimeter.\n\nPlease Note that on older devices such as the 4S, 5, 5S and 5C as well as on any iPod Touch and iPad Models older than iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4 as well as the Apple Watch 1 and 2, this app will not be able to read barometric pressure values and not display any useful information. The first generation 4-inch iPhone SE is not supported - the new SE (2020) is!\n\nAll basic features, the Barometer, the Altimeter, the Trend and the Widget are completely free to use for everyone and are fully functional at maximum accuracy available. No ads!\nThe only features with restricted access via In-App-Purchase are listed at the end under \"Pro Features\". Those are nice to have features for power users or those that want to show their support for the App!\n\nFeatures (free for everyone)\n- Barometer for weather\n- Altimeter for outdoor activities\n- HomeScreen Widget (iOS 14 and newer)\n- Today-View Widget (all Versions)\n- Watch App\n- Up to 30d trend visualised with graphs\n- Interactive timeline on the trend graphs\n- No internet connection required since the sensor is built into the new iPhones and iPads\n- Supports 6 different pressure units\n- Support for 2 different altitude units\n- Analog Barometer with support for all 6 units\n- Configurable \"displayed accuracy\" / number of decimals\n- Supports setting a custom marker so you can track changes in barometric pressure\n- Manual altitude setting or automatic altitude updates based on GPS for the Barometer.\n- GPS Correction. In case your GPS seems to always be 'off' a little you can now fix this easily.\n- Portrait and Landscape support\n- No ads! No data collection beyond your device (history and settings). No web communication at all.\n\nPro Features (one time In-App Purchase required)\n- Change the Barometer Face\n- Fishing Barometer\n- Two scales on the Barometer\n- Data export in CSV Format"

      "label": "Alti-Barometer Pro is in a class by itself. This breakthrough app rewrites the rules for mobile barometers and altimeters with a combination of exclusive capabilities.\n\nFirst and foremost, Alti-Barometer Pro automatically and continuously analyses and logs readings from your device's pressure sensor in the background with no intervention required - even when your phone is locked and in standby. Because it's a real data-logging barometer, Alti-Barometer Pro shows you barometric pressure trends over time, and pressure trends are what tell you which way the weather may be headed.\n\nUsing the app’s proprietary BaroTrak algorithms, Alti-Barometer Pro also automatically compensates barometer readings for even small changes in altitude, and automatically compensates the altimeter for weather-related air pressure changes. The app's BaroTrak processing is an exclusive, class-defining innovation that makes a fully capable mobile barometer like ours possible.\n\nAnother exclusive feature is Storm Alarm which can notify you of large changes in barometric pressure over a defined time period.\n\nAlti-Barometer Pro logs barometric pressure and altitude data every 15 seconds to achieve incredible resolution and accuracy. This is on par with professional-grade weather instruments, and ensures that you can track both weather and altitude over time with very high precision. \n\nThese and other innovations set a new bar for mobile barometer and altimeter performance and capability, and Alti-Barometer Pro does all this while keeping power consumption to a minimum with very little use of power-hungry GPS.\n\nThe ability to continuously capture and process high-quality pressure data is just one part of the Alti-Barometer Pro story. The app’s advanced visualization capabilities let you see and explore your altitude and barometric pressure data using beautiful, fully-interactive graphics on your iPhone or Watch. And with the optional subscription upgrade, you can automatically save and view daily snapshots of your altimeter and barometer logs so you can go back and look at that epic storm or impressive climb.\n\nAlti-Barometer Pro also turns any iPhone into a cloud-connected barometric weather station. With its unique BaroMap feature, Alti-Barometer Pro lets you automatically and anonymously upload your barometric pressure data to Apple’s secure iCloud, and view barometric trends and pressure information across the app's user community on a fully interactive global map.\n\nAnd Alti-Barometer Pro’s \"Share\" feature allows you to easily share interesting barometer or altimeter graphs through social media, messages, or email.\n\nAlti-Barometer Pro supports all Watch complication styles and iOS widgets to keep you up to date with altitude and barometric pressure trends at a glance. The app's Watch complications and widgets are fully live, which means that you see current data and trends without having to manually refresh the app - another unique capability that sets Alti-Barometer Pro apart.\n\nAs an optional upgrade feature, the app also provides full CSV-compatible data export and import so you can save a detailed record of a hike, climb, or that big storm and analyze or view it later at full precision. And outdoor enthusiasts will appreciate the app’s climb and descent logs as well as real-time vertical speed and altitude trend reporting.\n\nWe originally developed Alti-Barometer Pro because we missed the altitude/barometer functionality of our dedicated ABC (altimeter/barometer/compass) watches. We couldn’t find an app that even came close, and we decided to create something much, much better.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.bogbridges.com/altibarometerproprivacy\nTerms of use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Xasteria was originally created to bring the excellent ASTRO weather forecast of the service 7Timer to your iOS device. With worldwide coverage and one of the best performing astro-seeing models, it is a great tool for all stargazers.\n\nThe app has been extended to offer you quick access to all of your favourite weather resources and tools: Clear Sky Charts (for North American users), Clear Outside, Meteoblue, Windy, Astrospheric, Sat24.com, the latest water vapor satellite images and even light pollution maps.\nISS and bight satellite passes for your location are also shown (data from heavens-above.com).\n\nThe main forecast source, 7Timer, is based on the NOAA/NCEP-based numeric weather model, the Global Forecast System (GFS) and gives you a forecast for the entire globe with a resolution of about 20km at 3-hour intervals.\n\nThe data provided includes:\n-Sun/Moon rise/set & twilight times.\n-Moon phase.\n-Cloud cover.\n-Astronomical seeing.\n-Atmospheric transparency.\n-Temperature.\n-Humidity.\n-Rain/Snow.\n-Atmospheric instability.\n-Wind.\n-Wind direction.\n\nXasteria provides you with a choice of 3 visualization modes for the data: the new 7Timer! ASTRO graphics, the color-stripe graphics similar to some other astro-forecast services and a raw text mode.\n\nXasteria is available in English, Greek and French. If you would like to translate it to your own language, please contact the author.\n\nXasteria will always be ad-free. If you  would like to support it, as well as fund the 7Timer service behind it, you can get Xasteria Plus, which can access non-free weather sources and has some extra features like night vision mode, iPhone landscape view, lunar calendar, location manager.\n\nI would appreciate a quick review on the App Store if you are using the app (there will be no popup asking you in the app as I hate those). If you have a specific request/suggestion you can also try the official app page at http://astro.ecuadors.net"

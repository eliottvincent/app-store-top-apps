Includes improved AI, 3D landscape, new exclusive features.\n\n*** Carcassonne fits that opening game niche that every game group needs. -Tyler Nichols, Board Game Quest\n*** Carcassonne = Great game, great mechanics, great pieces, great fun! -The Board Game Family\n\nA TILE PLACEMENT GAME OF CREATING LANDSCAPES, CLAIMING AREAS, AND GAINING POINTS\nDiscover or re-discover Carcassonne, the multi-awarded tile-based game in which players draw and place their tiles to build a medieval city. Place your cities, roads, abbeys or fields to enlarge your landscape, then place your followers, the meeples. Knights, robbers or farmers... Each meeple will help you control your territory and win points.\nBut be careful, you will need all your best strategy and tactics to maximum your points! Place your tiles and your meeples wisely to stop your opponents and win the game.\n\n6 EXPANSIONS: ENLARGE YOUR LANDSCAPE AND OPTIMIZE YOUR POINTS\nThanks to the mini expansions \"\"The River\"\" and \"\"The Abbot\"\", you can embellish your landscape and vary your game to enjoy new ways to play! Double or even triple your points thanks to the new buildings in the Inns & Cathedrals expansion! And with the Traders & Builders expansion, score more points with the trading commodities and build faster with the builders! Discover the city of Carcassonne covered with a blanket of white snow in the Winter Edition... and look out for the Gingerbread Man and the bonus points he'll give you! Beware of the Dragon in \"\"the Princess and the Dragon\"\" expansion! He could eat your Meeples if you're not cautious. And be kind with the Princess: she might prefer you to other Meeples and toss them out of the cities!\n\nFEATURES\n• Accessible and tactical gameplay adapted from the award-winning Carcassonne board game    \n• 6 expansions:\n- The River, the Inns & Cathedrals, the Traders & Builders, the Winter Edition and Princess & Dragon are all available to purchase from the Game Shop.\n- Unlock The Abbot for free using your Asmodee account.\n• Up to 6 players!

They all propose a better challenge than the previous ones. Players who want to experiment a true challenge will play against the Conqueror AI who is the strongest AI of the game.\n• Try out the aerial top view to refine your strategy!\n• Additional strategic layers compared to the physical version:\n- field view which allows you to see the field possession of each player\n- remaining tile list: allows you to see the tiles which are remaining in the draw pile\n\nLanguages available: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish\n\nYou can follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and You Tube!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/asmodeedigital/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/asmodeedigital\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/asmodeedigital/\nYou Tube: https://www.youtube.com/asmodeedigital"

After you apply for a job as the barista of Papa's Mocharia, you learn that a year-long film is being made about the coffeehouse -- and you're now the main star!  Under the watchful eye of the documentary crew, you'll be brewing espresso, steaming and frothing milk, and crafting eye-catching layered drinks for your picky customers.  Work your way through the holidays as you serve seasonal coffee and cannoli, unlock new ingredients, and earn Daily Specials with delicious latte and macchiato recipes.\n\n-- GAME FEATURES --\n\nBREW ESPRESSO AND LAYER DRINKS - Use the Brew Machines to make freshly-brewed shots of espresso, and to steam and froth milk for the customers' drinks.  On the Build Station, you'll layer the espresso and milk into a large cup along with colorful powders and flavored syrups, creating a delicious layered latte that looks as great as it tastes!  Complete the drink with toppings, whips, and drizzles for that finishing touch.\n\nCRAFTING CANNOLI - Customers will order a custom-made cannoli along with their Papaccino drinks.  Choose the cannoli shell, line up the nozzles to pipe it full of cream, and garnish the cannoli with delicious toppings for the perfect sweet treat to enjoy with a coffee.\n\nHOLIDAY FLAVORS - Celebrate the seasons with delicious holiday flavors!

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.\n\nThe stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland.

In this sense, it may be one of the rare and interesting additions to the App Store. \n\nIf you enjoy subtle, intense boss fights, this is for you. We don’t smother the screen with numbers or excessive effects — engaging combat is the focus.\n\nNow, let us seek out our monsters, and meet them face to face.\n\nAnimus - Stand Alone (Ire SA Edition) is the companion game supplementing continued work on Ire - Blood Memory.\n\n◆◆◆Background\n\"Countless possibilities had been while hope rose and fell, but all were beaten into the dust, bringing an end to the age of champions. The lands now lay desolate and empty but for the acrimonious shadows, enslaved in the falsehood of their own creation. Yet... there is one left wandering the lands in torturous pilgrimage, to escape this prison... or end it.\"\n\n◆◆◆Game Characteristics*\n. Standalone (offline capable)\n. Tactical Action(RPG)\n. Linear progression\n. Tense combat mechanics and boss fights\n. Button mashing will get you killed\n. New perspective (literal and figurative)\n. New bosses and weapons\n.

The points of each round are added and the winner is the player who will first reach a certain goal.\nInside the program you will find complete instructions on how exactly the game is played.\n\n\"Xeri++\" supports all the known variants of the game:\n-2 or 4 players\n-4 or 6 cards in hand\n-16 or 24 points in each round\n\nIn the current version you can play against the computer or against other human players. \n\nAgainst the computer: \n-\"Xeri++\" has one of the best Artificial Intelligence engines. In addition, however, you can choose the level of difficulty.\n\n-The difference between the levels of difficulty has nothing to do with the way the computer plays (for example, it does not deliberately let you win and it does not cheat on you) but only with how many cards it remembers from what has been played. Thus, at the maximum level, the computer will remember all the cards that have been played, so it will never make a mistake, and as the level gets lower, the potential mistakes  are increased.\n\nAgainst other human players via Wifi:\n-To connect with other play, ONLY ONE must connect as a \"SERVER\" and the others as \"CLIENTS\". The program uses the settings of the player-SERVER in the multiplayer game (number of players, score limit, etc). ATTENTION: If the player-SERVER disconnects, the game stops for all the other players!\n-The players-CLIENTS can be disconnected, and the computer will play in their place.\n\nStatistics:\nFor the geeks, the program offers complete statistics on the games you played, and even graphs!\n\nColors and designs:\n-In this new edition, you can choose from a wide range of designs for the deck and the background!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n(If you face any technical issue please contact with email with us before leave any  reviews)"

Also the current version has \"Final theme\", \"Order of merit\" and more. It is completely different to the original version. \n\nThe game follows actual history very closely, so you can also learn the history of science while you play the game. \n\nAll six songs were recorded in the studio by a real string quartet. These live performances suit the 17th century aesthetic very well. \n\nIf you are interested in Science, this will be a fun game for you!"

      "label": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!"

      "label": "The Business Demons have risen from beneath, and they're here to frack, drill, pillage and burn everything in sight! Follow the tale of young Derby Pocket, a Business Demon Intern, who discovers the dark secrets of the OMNIGEM!\n\nDon't let the cute art fool you: this is a deep, complex tactics game that'll provide a wicked challenge for years to come! From the designer of 100 Rogues and Auro: A Monster Bumping Adventure!\n\nGem Wizards Tactics is a turn-based strategy game with randomly generated maps and complex asymmetrical factions! Designed around endless single player play, Gem Wizards Tactics has three factions each with their own unique abilities which not only combine within factions, but you can also pick up units from other factions and combine them into your army to create totally unheard of new strategies!\n\nIn many ways, Gem Wizards Tactics will feel familiar to fans of Advance Wars, Fire Emblem or X-Com. But unlike these games, the maps are randomly generated, and enemy units are spawning randomly as well. This means that the challenges are much less puzzle like, and a lot more emergent and surprising—so your strategies will have to be as well. In this original turn based tactical war game, you take your army through a series of battles in which you’ve gotta capture the flags before taking too many losses!\n\nTake tight, puzzle-like tactics in the vein of Into the Breach and 868-HACK, add a big Fire Emblem-style overall package, and wrap the whole thing up in a nintendolicious candyflake aesthetic, and you have the new @keithburgun game, and it's great. - Frank Lantz, Director of the NYU Game Center\n\nGem Wizards Tactics is a whimsical and approachable turn-based tactical game, much like Into the Breach; 3 asymmetric factions, procedurally-generated maps and enemies, excellent synergies. Super fun.” - Designer Plays on Steam\n\nFor the most part, every unit is extraordinary, which provides an excellent amount of depth when it comes to strategizing. - Turn Based Lovers\n\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n+ No in-app purchases! We don't collect data or any of that weird stuff!\n+ Wild powers with fun and surprising side-effects! Drill for oil, which is slippery and lights on fire! Spray water around until you create new rivers! Freeze those rivers over with ice magic! Push people over the frozen ice floe, sliding uncontrollably into that hole you drilled! It's like a wild Rube Goldberg Machine of tactics!\n+ Randomly generated maps! The map geometry, enemy squads you're facing off, and Unit Rescue rewards are different every time you play!\n+ Five distinct factions with LOTS of asymmetry: the classic royal high fantasy knights of the Azure Order; the resource-exploiting, terrain-burning Business Demons, or the nature and weather-controlling Potatoes: each have their own unique playstyles and abilities. Better yet, there's cross-pollination between the factions, so maybe you can find some neat combo for your Azure Knights sliding over a bunch of freshly fracked oil slicks! Or, choose the Neverending Party, a raucous group of high-energy, hard-rockin' Skeletons!\n+ Over thirty unique unit types, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and unique special abilities! (More being added all the time in free DLC!)\n+ FIVE game modes: Tutorial, Story Mode, Campaign Mode, Ranked Mode and Custom Games.\n+ Colorful pixel art and an original melodic soundtrack."

      "label": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.

      "label": "Adventure and relaxation, the main selling point of the island of AYUDA, well at least that’s what the brochure says. Half of the island of AYUDA is a vacation paradise with hotels, beaches and bars. The other half of AYUDA is an unspoilt ancient land only ever visited by smuggling pirates in the 1500’s. \n\nStory has it that after smugglers became stranded on the island and discovered by Spanish explorers the island got its name from distress messages crafted on the beach, ‘ayuda’ which is the Spanish for ‘help’.\n\nSince the island of AYUDA was named, there has been rumours of a mysterious hidden treasure somewhere deep inside the mountains, but with the terrain fairly inhospitable and the fear of ancient traps no one has been brave enough to tackle the adventure. \n\n\nABOUT\n\nAYUDA is a first person point and click graphic puzzle adventure, similar to games you may have played in the ’90’s. A simple gameplay interface consisting of the world that you explore and an inventory panel where you can collect, combine and use items you find along the way to solve puzzles.\n\nExplore areas, collect hidden objects and take in your surroundings. You will need all of your puzzle solving skills to put together a plan to make your way through the island, solving riddles and down the many paths towards the secret treasure of AYUDA.\n\nHow you tackle the puzzles is down to you. Each puzzle has a logical solution, so take your time, there is no rush and enjoy the process of understanding what you have to do.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Easy to play, touch the screen to move around. Use the arrow to move back\n• Use the inventory to collect, combine and use objects\n• Beautiful all original mystery adventure 3D graphics, environments and atmosphere to explore\n• Immersive backing soundtrack and effects to pull you into the puzzle adventure\n• Automatic saving - Use the ‘Continue’ button on the main menu to pick up where you left off\n\nHINTS & TIPS\nIf you need a hint or clue while playing AYUDA then please reach out over email or social media (contact links can be found on my website) and I will be more than happy to help you.\n\n\nSMALL PRINT\nAYUDA was created from the imagination of a solo indie developer. \n\n“I am always excited to hear people playing my games and their experience along the way. Adventure gaming is my passion and your feedback helps my games get better.“\n\nAYUDA is compatible with all devices and has been designed to be as resource efficient as possible to allow play on many different devices. With that said, if you do run into any difficulties please email so I can provide updates that help everyone enjoy the adventure."

However, if you don't have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.\n\nYou are summoned by the Tiarnaigh of Linmore to lift the curse that ravages their land. Many suffer from the Failing Sickness, brought on by an unusually wet and cold summer. Loch Linmore is swollen to twice its size. Some monks at Bidewell Abbey in the north suffer collective possession and are confined, raving, to their cells. The path to Bidewell is filled with mist. Village children have disappeared. Some, like his Court Astrologer, blame the Abbess of Bidewell Abbey. They claim she is a witch. Some say it's the devilish Olc Mhor's work. You have come with great recommendations and are tasked to remove the curse so his people can be free.\n\nTo access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select \"Curse of Linmore\" as your travel destination. It's recommended you reach at least level 80 before taking on the challenges posed by this expansion."

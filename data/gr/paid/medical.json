Wherever you are within the allied health professions - medical school, nursing school, NP school, PA school, residency, and beyond - you can improve your knowledge base in the short and long term with these key associative memory aids.\n\nMedical Mnemonics puts 1796 clever acronyms, rhymes, and memory tricks on your iPhone or iPod Touch, covering topics ranging from Anatomy and Biochemistry to Pharmacology and Surgery.\n\nThe database is fully searchable and can be quickly filtered by discipline and by system. Create a Favorites list, and search and filter it similarly.\n\nThe best mnemonics can be those you make yourself. Add your own mnemonics to the database, where they'll appear seamlessly alongside those which come with the program.  Submit them instantaneously to the Medical Mnemonics server for review by an MD (that's me!) and inclusion in the next version.\n\nYou can email any mnemonic to a colleague from within Medical Mnemonics. He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human. If you find a mistake, email us; we will pay a $5 bounty per substantive mistake found to the first reporter of that mistake!"

      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

This award winning program reliably analyzes and diagnoses your baby’s cry, then recommends helpful solutions – all in less than 5 seconds! Is your baby hungry, sleepy, annoyed, stressed or bored? The Cry Translator will tell you. Click “…More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n- Awarded Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n\n-  I love it ! A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

      "label": "Simple, fast, yet more thorough than any other pregnancy wheel available for the iPhone, Perfect OB Wheel is better than just a replacement for your trusty paper wheel.\n\nHere's why Perfect OB Wheel is your best choice of gestational calculator:\n\n 1) Input flexibility: Start with one of:\n    • Last menstrual period (LMP)\n    • Conception date\n    • Estimated date of confinement/delivery (EDC)\n    • Ultrasound dating: Number of weeks and days gestation as of a given date (\"X Weeks\").\n\n 2) Input speed: Other wheels for the iPhone make you conform to them for entering your patient's information. Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

Sometimes the cold is attended with raised temperature – worst case with fever.\nNot only a bad cold, also a number of other diseases come along with fever and need a quick treatment. Particularly children incline to fight against illnesses with fever. \nIf you go to the doctor, it is good to know the exact course of the fever, because according to fever pattern and other symptoms the doctor can diagnose faster. \nAbove all, if several members of the family are ill at the same time, you can keep the optimum overview with your fever diary.\n\n\nWith FEVER you grasp simply and intuitively:\n● Temperature and fever measuring zones (mouth, ear, arm, forehead or Rectal)\n● Medication and dose (e.g., Paracetamol, 1 tablet)\n● Events and condition (e.g., headaches, vomiting)\n● Notes\n\nOther features:\n● Fever and illness adjustable for several people\n● Easy representation of the temperature curve by means of graph\n● Direct comparison to previous measurements (arrow and value)\n● Directly representation of fever classification\n● Support for Celsius and Fahrenheit\n● Support of 'Landscape' view layout\n● \"Tell-A-Friend\" function\n\nNotes:\n● This program is not a substitute for a doctor's visit!

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

A calibration procedure was also implemented to accurately measure the angle with the horizontal plane as in the sacral slope. \nThrough though the developpement, Regis has shown an extraordinary sense of patience and astounding programming skills so as to accurately provide a tool that fits the needs of the surgeon and the spine care provider to best treat the patients ; and I thank him for his efforts. \n\nI am very proud of releasing this small software in the community, and I hope it will facilitate a little bit the life of my dear colleagues and the patients. \n\nI thank the colleagues who gave me their kind advice on the software during its developpement and wish they will find it useful.\"\n \nDr Frederic Jacquot\nChirurgien du Rachis\nChirurgien Orthopédiste,\nChirurgien des Hôpitaux de Paris"

The model is based on data derived from women found to have at least one adnexal tumor that was judged not to be physiological, underwent a standardized ultrasound examination, and was later selected for surgery. \n\nThe ADNEX model contains nine predictors: age, serum CA-125 (U/ml), type of center (oncology vs other), maximum lesion diameter, proportion of solid tissue, number of papillary projections, the presence of >10 cyst locules, acoustic shadows, and ascites. An oncology center is defined as a tertiary referral center with a specific gynecological oncological unit. \n\nThe model was developed by clinicians and statisticians from the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) group, and is based on clinical and ultrasound data from almost 6000 women recruited at 24 centers in 10 countries (Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Czech Republic, Poland, France, UK, China, Spain, and Canada).\n\nA full description of model development and validation is given in Van Calster B, Van Hoorde K, Valentin L, Testa AC, Fischerova D, Van Holsbeke C, Savelli L, Franchi D, Epstein E, Kaijser J, Van Belle V, Czekierdowski A, Guerriero S, Fruscio R, Lanzani C, Scala F, Bourne T, Timmerman D.

      "label": "Dr. Goniometer is a tool whereby physiatrists, orthopaedists and physiotherapists can measure the movement angles of their patient’s articulations and store all related data.\nIt is the only tool supported scientifically by comparative studies on real cases, as mentioned hereunder.\n\nThe tool enables the management of patient records, measurement of patient articulation angles and storage of all related information to build up historical data bases for each articulation and movement.\n\nMeasurement is by photographing the articulation and identifying the pictures taken with three separate markers. Picture taking is supported with perpendicular reference to ground level, iPhone alignment identification and patient central position referencing. These data come from Medical Literature suggestions for completing this type of reliable measurement (Cf. for instance, Dunlevy C. et al. \"Procedural considerations for photographic-based joint angle measurements\", Physiother. Res. Int. 2005; 10(4): 190-200).\n\nDr. Goniometer has been used in recent studies – the publication of which is currently under way – that have identified reliability and measurement errors comparable to those of professional measurement tools (such as the Universal Goniometer, Isokinetic Tools Goniometer and the like).\nThe study \"A new iPhone-based Goniometer (Dr. Goniometer): a Validation Study\", in particular, reports that various measurements on several patients were made simultaneously with professional tools and Dr. Goniometer. Measurements with the latter were repeated by different physiatrists and physiotherapists and results indicate comparable measurement errors for the Dr. Goniometer and other tools.\n\nIn addition to the above, further features are also available through in-app purchase to:\n- computer browse all Dr. Goniometer data (such as patient records, measurements, photos and the like) and print any patient articulation record;\n- backup all Dr. Goniometer data on the computer;\n- use a previously created back-up to restore all Dr. Goniometer data on any iPhone (as in the event of iPhone replacement or application re-installation, for instance).\n- export all measures in a Excel file through iTunes File Sharing, connecting your iphone and PC through the USB cable.\n\nAll the above features are available with no additional computer software required, just a common Internet browser; any operating system is supported, whether Microsoft, Apple, or others.\nThe iPhone and PC used must be on the same WiFi network for computer and Dr. Goniometer connection. Should no WiFi connection be available, if the iPhone is be connected to a mobile network and the PC to the Internet, the iPhone and computer connection will be based on the settings of the mobile network in use.\n\nDr. Goniometer ensures constant measurement tool availability and access to patient data bases. New measurements can always be made at each patient visit, with no need for constant patient record updating as completed measurements are stored automatically on the iPhone or PC used and are retrievable whenever needed."

      "label": "SCOLIOTRACK IS A SAFE AND INNOVATIVE WAY TO TRACK ONE'S SCOLIOSIS CONDITION\n◆ Invited to Wall Street Journal 2011 Asia Innovative Awards \n◆ Researched and clinically proven to work! \n◆ Scoliometers usually cost $150-$300. \n◆ Easy and simple to use, no medical knowledge or training needed! \n\nThe device allows the user to track the progress of the abnormal spinal curves that occur in scoliosis. With the touch of an iPhone the user is easily able to track their month to month progression. This easy-to-use program is suitable for scoliosis sufferers of all ages. Its high degree of accuracy makes this application suitable for professional such as Doctors, Chiropractors or Physiotherapist and simple enough for personal use at home.\n\nThe device proves much safer than x-ray technology and can be used in between doctor’s visits to track one’s individual condition.\n\n“With ScolioTrack, the patient can track the curvature in the spine from month to month by using the iPhone accelerometer, just as a doctor would with a scoliometer,” said Dr. Lau. “A scoliometer is a device that measures objectively the severity of a scoliosis. And so it is with ScolioTrack.”\n\nThe technology tracks the patient’s Angle of Trunk Rotation (ATR), which is a key measurement in screening and planning for the Health In Your Hands approach to scoliosis treatment. ScolioTrack also tracks a person’s height, weight and photo record of a persons back, both beneficial for growing teenagers or health-conscious adults with scoliosis. \n\nScolioTrack saves all the information in one convenient location and provides touch of the finger retrieval for future checkups.  An easy-to-read display shows data output in graph format for ease of tracking changes over time and the new technology is capable of saving and tracking the data of multiple users. With ScolioTrack’s access to the latest breaking news regarding the condition, and its user-friendly support guides, patients can gain an effortless handle on their disorder.\n \nFEATURES OF PROGRAM: \n• Simple, attractive, elegant interface.\n• Safer and more affordable than x-rays.\n• Can be used with multiple users and saves their data conveniently on the iPhone for future reference.\n• Tracks and saves a person’s Scoliosis Angle (ATR), a key measurement in screening for and planning treatment of scoliosis.\n• Tracks a person’s height and weight, ideal for growing teenagers with scoliosis or adults who are health conscious.\n• Check your results and Scoliosis changes in beautiful history graph.\n• Camera function takes a photo of the person’s back to notice any changes to the back visually such as rib humps, hip protrusion, body alignment or spinal deviation and compare it easily with previous photo records.\n• Displays the latest news feed on scoliosis to keep users informed and up-to-date.\n• Comprehensive database of frequently asked questions about scoliosis.\n• Full help and easy to follow guides so anyone can track their scoliosis in the comfort of their own home.\n\n-----------------------------------\nABOUT DR KEVIN LAU\nDr. Kevin Lau's ScolioTrack is one element of his comprehensive \"Health In Your Hands\" series for a natural, non-surgical, highly effective and proven method for reversing scoliosis. The other elements include his best selling books \"Your Plan for Natural Scoliosis Correction and Prevention\" and \"An Essential Guide for Scoliosis and a Healthy Pregnancy\" which has been translated to 9 languages and an exercise DVD for scoliosis, \"Scoliosis Exercises for Prevention and Correction\". He is a recipient of the \"Best Health-care Provider Award\" by the Straits Time and featured on TV prime time news."

      "label": "The app determines the names of colors. It can be of help to people who cannot see and name all colors (color ametropia, color blindness). The app determines the name of a color using the color information of a photo or the setting of a color slider.\n\nTake a picture of the object whose color you want to know. Touch the object and the matching color name will be determined and displayed. Or use color sliders for red, green, and blue to create or try out colors. For each color you select in the color slider, the color name is determined and displayed. To take a photo you can use the camera in the menu below or you can take the photo with your Apple Camera and then open it from an album. Any photo can be used to identify the name of a color. \n\nYou can switch the zoom mode on and off with a long press gesture. The zoom mode can also be activated with the magnifying glass icon at the bottom right. If the color whose name you want to know is covered by parts of the menu, you can hide all control elements. To do this, touch the determined color name at the top right next to the color field. The app can be used in portrait and landscape format.\n\nThe default settings of the app are opened with the gray icon at the bottom left. Here you can find the options Adopt result, Color values and Measuring area. Adopt result means the determined color value is adopted in the color slider. If this option is switched off, the last saved value is used in the color slider. With the Color values option, you can display the color values for red, green and blue in addition to the determined color name. It is better to switch this option off for small displays. Measuring area controls the number of pixels used to calculate the color name. The medium setting 7 x 7 often gives a good result.\n\nYou can activate the color slider for red, green and blue with the color field at the top left. If the color slider is active, you can save the current color with the plus icon at the bottom right. The color is displayed in a list. The color you select in this list will be applied to the color slider.\n\nThe naming of colors is a complex process that is influenced by general and individual color perception, experience and the current lighting situation. For this reason, a percentage value is calculated for each color name, which indicates how reliable the result is.\n\nThe app is intended as an aid for color-blind people. The app is not a photo or graphic app. Liability for the correctness of all color names determined with the app is not accepted."

      "label": "Do you snore at night and your partner complains about it? Are you sick to death of snoring of your partner?\n\nSnore Control can be the right solution for you. This application records your talk or snoring while you are asleep, creates the graph of noise in room during the night, takes the total time of snoring down and moreover it can try to stop your snoring.\n\nSnoring detection is based on artificial intelligence (A.I.) with the support of a new Apple machine learning technology. By using a large number of snoring samples, we can achieve high accuracy in statistics and in snoring detection itself.\n\nHow it works:\nMobile microphone is used to monitor and optionally record the noise in surroundings. By using intelligent noise analysis the application detects the snoring, makes the statistics or else activates the stop snoring function (at least two snores one after another) - it quiets you down using a sound or vibration (only iPhone). How to place your device correctly is shown in instructions. \nBy using the tracker data and by defining your own factors (activities/means/drugs/custom notes) it is possible to find out which facts influence your sleep positively and limit your snoring. At your disposal there are beautiful statistic charts for simple and efficient analyzing of your sleeps/nights. \n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- SNORE ANALYZER (TRACKER):\nSnoring analyzes and statistics with complete history and beautiful charts.\n\n- HIGH TECH SNORING DETECTION:\nAccurate snoring detection based on A.I.\n\n- ADJUSTABLE RECORDING SOUND SENSITIVITY:\nFor different sound conditions in your room (a quiet or loud environment).\n\n- RECORDING ONLY SNORING\n\n- FAVORITE RECORDINGS\n\n- SHARING RECORDINGS WITH YOUR FRIENDS:\nSend recordings via email, iMessage or post to Facebook.\n\n- STOP SNORING:\nPossibility of playing chosen sound or using iPhone vibration when the snoring is detected. \n\n- FACTORS, WAKE UP MOOD, NOTES:\nUser can place factors (alcohol, coffee, stress etc.) to every night as well as the mood after waking up or users own notes. \n\n- ACTIVATION DELAY:\nStart monitoring after a period of time.\n\n- BACKGROUND MODE:\nMonitoring runs also in background mode.\n\n- APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION\n\n- iCLOUD SYNCHRONIZATION:\nSynchronization among your devices (optionally).\n\n- EXPORTING HISTORY TO CSV FILE\n\n- APPLE WATCH:\nPlays haptic (sound, vibration) if snoring is detected.\nIf you buy SMART ALARMS then it will track your sleep movements and it can play haptic (sound, vibration) if alarm is set.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:\n* It is recommended to connect your iPhone (iPad) to a charger.\n* Set \"Airplane Mode\" or \"Do Not Disturb\" on your iPhone (iPad) for undisturbed sleep.\n* Place your iPhone (iPad) according to the instructions (see screenshots).\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\nHappy customers are our highest priority.

      "label": "Cholesterol management is a complex, necessary task in a huge number of patient encounters. We know that getting it right is a vital part of promoting long-term health. Let ATP3 Lipids help!\r\n\r\nThe Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults - or the ATP III for short - describes the evidence-based cholesterol testing and management recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program. These guidelines categorize lipid levels by lipoprotein type, define cholesterol goals based on specific patient characteristics, and describe therapeutic recommendations for management of cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids puts fast and thorough access to this cholesterol management algorithm on your iPhone or iPod Touch, from your patients' specific cholesterol goals to details of cholesterol management drugs (dosing, percentage change, side effects, and contraindications).\r\n\r\nYou input your patients' data - lipid panel by numbers and risk factors by simply tapping to select. Input is beautiful and easy, using the popular interface from MediMath.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids then shows you the lipid classifications and specific therapeutic recommendations of the ATP III based on the lipid panel and risk factors.  You can tap a recommendation to view further information.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids includes a complete Framingham Cardiac Risk calculator which is automatically presented for use if the patient's risk factors indicate a need to evaluate the hard 10-year cardiac risk.\r\n\r\nThe info button at the top-right displays the ATP III algorithm and reference tables in textual form (the Quick Desk Reference on which the ATP3 Lipids therapeutic recommendations are based).  Tapping the 'Show Full Report' button from the info screen switches to the complete 284 page ATP III final report.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids keeps track of the last information you entered and restores it when launched, with a Clear button easily accessible to begin working up the next patient.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n • ATP III based, patient-specific cholesterol goals\r\n • ATP III based, patient-specific therapeutic recommendations\r\n • Lipid lowering drug reference, with dosing, expected lipid effects, side effects, and contraindications\r\n • Metabolic syndrome reference, with criteria and recommendations\r\n • Both executive summary and complete text of the ATP III report included\r\n • Support for US and SI units\r\n\r\nIf you love the program, please leave a review.

      "label": "Instant Z-Scores For All The Paediatric Cardiology Parameters You Review Everyday.\n\nCardio Z has been developed by the experienced Paediatric Cardiology team at Evelina Children's Hospital, London, UK in collaboration with the technology company UBQO. The application makes it easy to calculate Z-scores and centiles for the many cardiac and paediatric measurements that are made in normal clinical practice. Cardio Z distils a wealth of clinical research parameters into a single accessible format.\n\nZ–scores and centiles are a means of expressing how far a measurement is above (positive Z-score) or below (negative Z-score) the average for the size or age of a patient. They are particularly important in assessing and monitoring growing patients, from fetal life though to adulthood.\n\nHealth professionals need to be able to access the normal ranges for cardiac parameters at every age and size, and cross-checking of measurements can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Cardio Z will prove invaluable for both clinicians working directly in Paediatric Cardiology, and those who work in other fields of Paediatrics.\n\nCardio Z allows users to access Z-scores without the need for an internet connection, or the requirement to input the same data in multiple calculators. Users can define their own settings so that they can be sure that their use of z-scores is consistent over time, whilst still allowing flexibility for the experienced clinician. Comprehensive guidance is available ensuring that measurements are consistent with those of the original research, allowing valid comparisons.\n\nCardio-Z creates a summary of all z-scores for each patient, which can then be saved, e-mailed or printed. Simple, reliable and time-saving.\n\nFULL LIST OF FEATURES:\n\n- Cardio Z allows calculation of z-scores of:\n- Height, weight, BMI and head circumference\n- Clinic blood pressure, with calculation of a user-defined 'target centile' blood pressure\n- Echocardiographic measurements of most cardiac structures, including valves, chambers, vessels and coronary arteries\n- Fetal echocardiographic measurements, using gestational age, femur length or biparietal diameter as size reference\n- M-mode echocardiography, including TAPSE\n- Pulsed wave velocities, including E/E' ratio and E/A ratio\n- Tissue Doppler velocities and time intervals. Including Isovolumetric Contraction Time (IVCT), Isovolumetric Relaxation Time (IVRT), Ejection Time and Myocardial Performance Index\n- Discriminant scores for neonatal aortic stenosis with borderline left ventricle\n- ECG parameters (2nd and 98th centiles) and corrected QT interval calculation\n\nEXTRA FEATURES:\n\n- Guidance tips for measurements, including diagrams and notes of the methods of the original researchers\n- Centiles, as well as z-scores, displayed for all parameters\n- No need to re-enter height and weight: baseline data only needs to be entered once\n- Generation of a .pdf summary which can be saved, e-mailed or printed\n- Saved patient Z-score summaries can be accessed and edited at a later date\n- Short-cut keys for frequently used parameters\n- Body surface area calculator can be defined to use the same algorithms as the original research\n- Cardio Z reduces the inconvenience of making Z-score calculations, and improves the correct application of this important clinical tool. The App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions.  \n\nWe hope you enjoy using Cardio Z!"

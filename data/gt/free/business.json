During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly.

It provides the same user- friendly experience that’s earned BBM millions of fans worldwide – with the end-to-end security enterprise needs. \n\nBBM Enterprise allows users to take advantage of the speed, reliability and privacy of BBM for faster communication, collaboration and decision making while providing security conscious organizations enhanced security over corporate data.\nBBM Enterprise is the ideal business communication tool because it is mobile and immediate. Unlike enterprise IM tools that were originally designed for use on the desktop, BBM Enterprise offers a truly mobile experience, on a variety of devices.\nWith BBM Enterprise, you only need one app to cover your mobile messaging and collaboration needs. Users know when their colleagues have received and read messages, so they can collaborate with confidence, in real-time. One-to-one chats, group discussions and file sharing all happen with the protection required by security-focused organizations – and all with an immediacy and accountability that’s hard to achieve through any other communication channel. \n\nBBM Enterprise uses a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic library and leverages BlackBerry’s secure infrastructure, trusted by security-conscious and regulated organizations around the world, to protect data while it’s in transit and at rest.  All the added security offered by BBM Enterprise happens in the background, so there’s no impact on the BBM user experience.\n\n\nTo use BBM Enterprise for personal use, you can buy an auto-renewable subscription from within the app. The BBM Enterprise auto-renewable subscription provides access to use the app for enhanced secure communication for 6 months with a 1 year free trial.  Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the end of the free trial period. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase.\nTerms of Service: https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/legal/blackberry-messenger"

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

We cater to anyone who wants to buy lightly damaged or salvaged cars: used car dealerships buying hundreds of lightly damaged vehicles, mechanics and body shops looking for car parts, and people who buy cars for scrap.  \nA portion of our inventory comes from vehicle fleets (rental car agencies, company cars, etc.) or bank repossessions with little or no damage. We also serve buyers seeking wrecked car auctions, featuring vehicles with heavy to light amounts of damage, including totaled cars. \nYou can search our inventory without an account, but you’ll be able to bid and have access to additional features when you log into your IAA account. Register for a free account on our used car auction app, or visit our site at www.iaai.com to sign up. Search by make and model, then browse and filter our extensive inventory of cars up for auction. Use IAA 360 View to get complete details of the interior and exterior of every vehicle, then see and hear the engine running with our IAA Interact™ Merchandising Platform .

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

These apps can display content, take notes, create forms, capture photos, signatures and GPS, scan bar codes, and generate workflows for a wide variety of business scenarios. You can also build web apps and chatbots.\n\nAppSheet uses data from your cloud storage -- Google Sheets, Excel on Office365, Dropbox or Box, Smartsheet, SalesForce, and a variety of databases (SQLServer, mySQL, Postgres, and DynamoDB). You can create an app in minutes and enhance it to create rich custom apps for your team, business, or enterprise. Check review sites like Capterra to learn how AppSheet’s modern technology platform outpaces older low-code solutions like PowerApps, Salesforce1, and App Maker. \n\nAppSheet is an ideal solution for many business, including those in property management, agriculture, supply chain, operations, salesforce management, education and more. Here are just a few scenarios:\n\nWORKING WITH REMOTE TEAMS\nApps built with AppSheet can help a remote team work with centralized data saved in spreadsheets (eg: in Google Drive, Box, or Droppox) or SQL databases. \n\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nMillions of people manage projects using Google Sheets, Excel, and Smartsheets. Project managers can build apps with AppSheet to display and share project data through a mobile device with other team members and stakeholders.

No more managing dozens of files that go back and forth via email!\n\nEDUCATION\nManage study plans, school rosters, grading, and group work by creating a custom app with charts, maps, text summaries and image galleries. Share the app securely with students and colleagues.\n\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT:\nKeep track of your customer pipeline on a Google Sheet but get the benefits of a streamlined custom mobile app using AppSheet. You can also interact with your data in new ways like building maps from your data, calling or messaging to telephone numbers, sending emails to contacts, and building catalogs using image galleries."

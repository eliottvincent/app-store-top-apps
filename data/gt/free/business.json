      "label": "A simple tool for businesses to talk to their customers. — WhatsApp Business from Meta\n\nWhatsApp Business enables you to have a business presence on WhatsApp, communicate more efficiently with your customers, and help you grow your business.\n\nIf you have separate business and personal phone numbers, you can have both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger installed on the same phone, and register them with different numbers.\n\nIn addition to the features available in WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business includes:\n\n• BUSINESS PROFILE: Create a profile for your business to help your customers find valuable information — like your website, location, or contact information.\n\n• BUSINESS MESSAGING TOOLS: Be more responsive to your customers by using Away messages to indicate that you're away.\n\n• LANDLINE/FIXED NUMBER SUPPORT: You can use WhatsApp Business with a landline (or fixed) phone number and your customers can message you on that number. During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

This gives you an extra layer of security so that you - and only you - can access your applications.\n\nWhen you sign in to Okta, you can use Okta Verify to obtain a temporary 6-digit code or to approve a request notification sent to your device (your organization must enable notifications to use this feature).\n\nOkta values your privacy. Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

It provides the same user- friendly experience that’s earned BBM millions of fans worldwide – with the end-to-end security enterprise needs. \n\nBBM Enterprise allows users to take advantage of the speed, reliability and privacy of BBM for faster communication, collaboration and decision making while providing security conscious organizations enhanced security over corporate data.\nBBM Enterprise is the ideal business communication tool because it is mobile and immediate. Unlike enterprise IM tools that were originally designed for use on the desktop, BBM Enterprise offers a truly mobile experience, on a variety of devices.\nWith BBM Enterprise, you only need one app to cover your mobile messaging and collaboration needs. Users know when their colleagues have received and read messages, so they can collaborate with confidence, in real-time. One-to-one chats, group discussions and file sharing all happen with the protection required by security-focused organizations – and all with an immediacy and accountability that’s hard to achieve through any other communication channel. \n\nBBM Enterprise uses a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic library and leverages BlackBerry’s secure infrastructure, trusted by security-conscious and regulated organizations around the world, to protect data while it’s in transit and at rest.  All the added security offered by BBM Enterprise happens in the background, so there’s no impact on the BBM user experience.\n\n\nTo use BBM Enterprise for personal use, you can buy an auto-renewable subscription from within the app. The BBM Enterprise auto-renewable subscription provides access to use the app for enhanced secure communication for 6 months with a 1 year free trial.  Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the end of the free trial period. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase.\nTerms of Service: https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/legal/blackberry-messenger"

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

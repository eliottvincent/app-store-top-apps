It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go.

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education. And today, we are a 250-people team of dedicated designers, artists, animators, and educators. To date, we have more than 30 apps, with our user base having reached 98M.\n\nWe are inspired by the idea of bringing fun into early education and enhancing a child's natural love of learning through educational apps for kids.\n\nIf you need help, have questions or just want to say “hi!”, get in touch at feedback@bini.games\nhttps://binibambini.com/terms-of-use/\nhttps://binibambini.com/privacy-policy/\n\nAll our games are safe, and do not collect any personal information."

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

      "label": "THE CUBE\nRubik’s cube was invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. Originally called the 'Magic Cube'.\n\nTHE METHOD\nReally easy to learn method for solving the Rubik’s cube taught in a fun and easy way even for a baby.\nThis method consists in 7 easy movements: White Cross, Middle Layer, Yellow Cross Position, Yellow Cross Orientation, Position Corners and Final Movement.\n\nThe method’s great advantage is its simplicity. As an example the Final Movement only needs 4 rotations and not the usual 10 or 12 that no one can remember.\n\nThe cube has 6 faces with 6 colors and 26 pieces:\nCenter: Pieces with 1 color located in each face’s center. It tells us the cube’s face’s color.\nCorner: Pieces with 3 colors located in the cube’s corners. There are 8 in total.\nBorder: Pieces with 2 colors located between cube corners. There are 12 in total.\n\nThe movement’s sequences are explained step by step. In each step you can see which face you have to rotate and a title. Try to remember these titles and the rotation comes alone.\n\nYour suggestions are more than welcome at info@fithx.com.\nSubject: Solve The Cube\nPlease tell us the case and the page number in the message."

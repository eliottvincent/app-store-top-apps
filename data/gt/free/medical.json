Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "“We designed this ECG App with the goal of making electrocardiogram reading as easy as possible. With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\n\n\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals.

      "label": "This application is designed for professional dentists who want to advise their patients more effectively. A large collection of 3D illustrations of dental treatment is sorted into groups and located inside this application.\n\nQuick and easy. Many dentists draw illustrations on paper every time explaining the treatment process to their patients, which can take some time. Finding the necessary illustration in the application database is very simple- it will take you about 10 seconds. \n\nThe 3D illustration is better than a photo. Patients can be shocked and frightened by seeing photographs of blood operations or a real photo of teeth.  If you use 3D illustrations, the patient most likely will perceive such information loyally.\n\nQuality and precision. All illustrations are based on accurate anatomy, real procedures, and treatment, based on the support of professional doctors and dental surgeons. \n\nAccess to the necessary illustrations will be instant regardless of where you are. This application does not use the Internet traffic to download the illustrations, all necessary 3D illustration files are already contained within the application.\n \nThe category of selected illustration topics allows you to access the most frequently used topics even faster. To do this, you will need to transfer the necessary topic to the Favorites section.\n\nThe list of topics by category:\nAnatomy of teeth and jaws. Information schemes. \nHygiene and teeth whitening. The development of tartar and plaque. Cleaning.  \nTherapy- dental treatment. Different types of caries. \nProsthetics. Veneers, Restorations, Bridges, Crowns, Removable prostheses.\nImplantation. Bone Augmentation. Partial and complete rehabilitation of teeth.  \nOrthodontics. Braces, Occlusion, Congenital and acquired defects.\nPeriodontology. Various gum problems and their treatment.\nSurgery. Extractions, Hemisection, Sinus-lifting, Bone Augmentation.  \n\n\nThe gallery works on the principle of the slideshow presentation. You open a topic you are interested in, the topic itself can contain 3-10 images. You choose the most suitable illustration and show to the patient and consult him. Next, you can switch the related images from the topic while you continue to consult."

Therefore there is a possibility that the user may not be able to fully hear all clinically relevant sounds.  We recommend the use of a high quality pair of headphones.\n\nDisclaimer:  Whilst based on genuine real patient histories information, all patients represented in this educational package are fictitious and any similarity with persons past or present is purely coincidental.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

It allows you to track childrens' growth over time and display the data points on any of the included WHO and CDC growth charts. You can track height, weight, head circumference and BMI and determine the corresponding percentiles.\n\nThere is also a percentile calculator for quick percentile lookup in case you just want to know the percentile of today's measurements.\n\n\n# Data Storage\n\nYou can add as many children and measurements to the built-in database as you like. The data is encrypted – if you have a passcode on your device – meaning it is secure should you lose the device.\n\n\n# Sharing\n\nThe measurements are directly added to the growth chart PDFs. You can email these PDFs, print them out (if you have an AirPrint enabled printer nearby) or share them with other means provided by iOS, such as storing into your Dropbox or box.com. You can do the same with a spreadsheet file containing all this kids on your device, or one file per kid. Finally, there is an export option so you can transfer all your data to a different device of yours or a colleague.\n\n\n# Units\n\nWhether you're used to the metric system and have all data available in centimeter and kilogram or whether you're in the US and using imperial units, Charts has got you covered. You can switch the units you want to use right from the keyboard and these units will be saved as your preferred units. You can also change units from a dedicated list when viewing your child's measurements.\n\n\n# Included Charts\n\nThe app currently includes 40 official growth charts from these institutions:\n\n• World Health Organization (WHO)\n-- 0 - 24 months (weight, length, head circumference and weight for length)\n-- 2 - 5 years (weight, height and weight for height)\n-- 5 - 10 years (weight)\n-- 5 - 19 years (height and BMI)\n\n• Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n-- 0 - 36 months (weight, height, head circumference and weight for length)\n-- 2 - 20 years (weight, height, BMI and weight for height)\n\n\n# Requirements\n\nTo run this app you will need a device running iOS version 7.0 or newer."

You can also receive alerts to notify you when you’re going above or below your preferred range and keep track of daily events which may impact your glucose levels.\n\nYour mobile app also sends your data to CareLink™ Personal therapy management software, so you can see your full information online and share your information with family or friends. Those closest to you can even receive SMS messages whenever you go out of range!\n\nTo use the Guardian Connect system, you will need the Guardian Connect transmitter and sensor as well as this app!\n\n* Not compatible with MiniMed pumps."

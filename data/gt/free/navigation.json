      "label": "Moovit is one app for all your urban mobility and transit rides. \n\nTransportation is an integral part of urban living. Whether you ride the train, subway, bus, light rail, ferry or metro, use dockless scooters, bikes, ride-sharing like Uber or Lyft, getting the best urban mobility information is critical. Enter Moovit! Moovit provides riders with a one-stop-shop journey experience to help them get from point A to B in the easiest and most efficient way. Get train and bus times, maps, and real-time arrival information with ease so that you can plan your trip with confidence. Pay and validate your rides.

Get step-by-step directions of optimal route bus, train, metro, bike, scooter or a combination of them. \n\nMoovit guides more than 930 million users in over 3400 cities throughout the world. Commuters will find updated bus and train times, transit maps, and, where available, real-time line arrivals. Locate nearby bus stops and train stations, travel with on-the-go live navigation guidance, receive get-off alerts when approaching your destination to ensure a smooth ride. That's why Moovit has been named one of the best apps of the year in 2017 by the App Store.\n\nMoovit is your personal assistant for all your transit rides! \n\n► Real-time arrivals. View real-time arrival information, which is taken directly from GPS devices positioned on buses and trains. Avoid wasting time guessing train times or bus times.\n\n► Digital payment. Purchase bus & train tickets and validate your digital pass with a tap (select cities). \n\n► Real time alerts. Know about issues ahead of time by receiving service alerts such as emergency or unexpected disruptions, delays, traffic jams, new construction, and more so that you can plan ahead if your bus time or train time changed.\n\n► Live Directions. Get step-by-step bus directions and other transit directions with live guidance from A-to-B: Know how long you need to walk to your station, view your line's arrival time, receive get-off alerts as you approach your destination, and more. \n\n► Visualize Your Stop.

Get easy access to lines, stations, and places you ride and visit all the time. Plus, get real-time updates if/when there are changes to your favorite lines in case your bus time or train time is impacted!\n\n► Bike routes. Get bike routes in addition to the bus, subway, train, or metro trip plans. If you ride bikes (yours or shared) we can plan a route that includes the train or bus. Moovit will help you plan a trip that meets your transit-needs. Bike docking stations are updated in real-time. Bike trip plans are only available in supported metro areas.\n\n► Maps view. Interested in seeing the whole picture? View all stations, routes, and lines on the subway or bus map.

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

This App gives you the ability to find out all the details of the ship, including size, speed, course, destination, estimated time of arrival and much more. All done with an easy to use and great looking App, which supports both iPhone and iPad.\n\nWhat people are saying about our App: \"Best user interface of any ship app I have tried\" B. Colson, Maine. \"Love the graphical design and the large icons that makes it easy to determine the ship type\" R. Clark, London. \n\nOpenSeaMap data is now accessible from within the app giving the possibility of showing the map data delivered by OpenSeaMap which includes seamarks, navigational rules and buoys in many areas of the world.\n\nFurthermore, you may measure the distance to the ships from your position, as you may measure distance between any two ships. This will show you if they are really on collision course or if it's just an illusion.\n\nSee the ships displayed on the map with large and crystal clear icons.\n\nBuilt-in compass and \"direction\" vector which helps find the direction of the ships and vessels. \n\nFurthermore, images of the ships may be watched or uploaded directly from the app.\n\nThis version supports iOS split screen multitasking found on selected device.\n\nAlso we added the possibility to place user defined waypoints on the map (press and hold your finger on map). The waypoints can be used as measurement points from the user or between ships. Furthermore, by pressing the waypoint the position is copied to the clipboard, making it easy to paste positions into other applications. Pressing the callout of the waypoint will prepare a text message with the position ready to send to other users.Once the text message is received the user can press it and get the position up in various map apps. This functionality has been requested by search and rescue workers who would like a tool to help pin point positions to colleagues out at sea.\n\nMake sure to check out our FREE version of the app (Trackaship Superlite) before buying if in doubt about the coverage of you local area. The free version will show the same ships, but not any details.\n\nThis app depends on the data received via the Internet and is dependent on the Internet for displaying data. \n\nData is collected on a voluntary basis and may change without notice. If you live in an area with poor or no coverage, you have possibility to improve the situation. Send an email to bbmtrackers@gmail.com and we will contact you. \n\nPlease note that the accuracy and reliability of data in this app are not covered by any guarantee and that, under no circumstances should be used for navigation. This app is no substitute for proper maritime instruments."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Geographic or UTM projected coordinates are shown at all times.\n\nPOINT SURVEY\nThe application allows data collection of single points, whose coordinates are got from the GPS, showing the estimated precision by a circle, as is usual in location-based programs.\nThe points are automatically numbered, recording date and time, and can be separated in different layers. User can also enter point codes, choosing them from a quick list.\n\nCONTINUOUS SURVEY\nIt is also possible to perform a continuous survey, recording vertices automatically by an interval of time, distance or height difference.\nAt any time you can view the polyline data, such as minimum and maximum heights, length and area. Vertex information can be displayed as well.\nYou can work with multiple layers, with different names and colors.\n\nRESULTS\nSurvey can be exported to a KML file, that can be sent by email from the app. This file can also be imported by TcpMDT and other CAD and GIS applications.\n\nSETTINGS\nEditing preferences lets you to change the appearance of map, points and lines captured. It also sets parameters for data collection, information displayed in real time and others.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n• Operating System: iOS 7 or higher\n• Integrated GPS\n• Internet access"

      "label": "Measure distance, perimeter and area on a map. Add stand alone points to understand better what is where on a map. Capture photos stamped with location, direction, altitude and time. Share and export your projects.\n\nPlanimeter app will be useful for measuring construction sites, roofs, lawns, fences, paving, pools, parking lots, fields and paths. Or even for just putting stand alone points on a map.\n\nWhere this planimeter app stands out?\n\n- Precise control of the planned/measured area. As you move a map, the app will show you what area/distance is going to be and what would be the size of adjacent lines. Even before you add a new point.\n\n- Native Google maps support adds extra zoom-in ability for satellite and hybrid maps.\n\n- Every point can have its own color and have text, audio and image attached.\n\n- You can move point directly on a main map screen (tap on a point and pick Move option) or in the dedicated point editor screen. Again, before you confirm the move you know perfectly what the resulting area/perimeter/distance will be.\n\n- You can hide/show shapes and point collections. This way you can focus only on what is important for the current project.\n\n- Flexible units of measurement allow you to configure when display of feet or meters changes to miles and kilometers. Same for area units.\n\n- Custom url, offline and import maps. Apple maps and Google maps are built into the app. And then, you can add other maps. The app supports adding custom url maps, downloading offline maps or importing maps (mbtiles, sqlitedb) that you might have crafted on your PC or Mac.\n\n- Kmz export and import option allows to transfer shapes and point collections in their entirety, including images and audio notes. This allows you to continue working on your project on different devices.\n\nBasic version allows you to create unlimited number of points and temporary measurement shapes (areas or routes), so you can measure with no limits. To add a new shape to measure, you just discard the previous one.\n\nPro pack upgrade adds:\n\n- Google and custom url, offline, imported maps support. Google maps adds extra zoom ability for satellite and hybrid maps.\n- Ability to save multiple point collections/shapes.\n- Import and export for a single point and whole shapes/collections.\n- Saving and sharing a map snapshot, the one that shows only the objects that you created on a map - buttons and tools removed.\n\nPro Pack upgrade is a one off upgrade, no subscription or recurring charges are involved.\n\nUse MENU (hamburger) button > DOCUMENTATION or SUPPORT  AND FEEDBACK options to get help. Just in case, support email is stan@blocoware.com. All emails are answered within hours or up to 9 hours if they come during CET/EU night time.\n\nWishing your happy measuring!\nPlanimeter 55 team."

Importing GPX files is also supported.\n\n---\nLight-weight navigator:\n\nThe essence of the app is to allow navigation on your watch. The light-weight navigator included in the app is very basic. It is not intended to be a replacement for full-featured mobile navigation apps, such as Google Maps or the pre-installed Maps app. Being light-weight means, for example, that it does not let you save offline maps and it does not recalculate routes automatically when you go off-course. In comparison to those full-featured apps, it will be better for your battery life. And, of course, it will allow you to navigate GPX files and all other possibilities which are offered in the route planning screen.\n\n---\nSUBSCRIPTION TERMS:\n\nThis app offers the possibility to purchase an auto-renewable subscription: \"Unlock r.485\". The length of this subscription is one year. By subscribing to our service, any content previously blocked in the app, such as the detailed driving instructions, will always be displayed.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n\nSubscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n\nTerms of use and privacy policy link: https://r-485-privacy-policy.blogspot.be"

      "label": "Moscow Metro\n\nNew convenient routes\n\nWith the updated Moscow Metro app, it has become even easier to build routes around the metro and the city! We have increased the launch speed of the service by 3 times, and also changed the principle of navigation.\n\nBuild routes around the metro and the city taking into account your preferences: the fastest or with the least number of transfers.\n\nWith the help of new filters, you will find out at which stations you can drink coffee, buy flowers and much more.\n\nNow Mosmetro passengers will be able to find out about the occupancy of the cars of the incoming train. The station card will display a train informing about the occupancy of each car in real time. And also added a function that shows how long the train will arrive.\n\nWhen you select a station, a card appears in the application where you can view useful information about it. If, for example, an escalator is being repaired nearby, you will be able to see the details of these works, including the timing.\n\nMetro exits and nearby transport are combined into a single block so that passengers can easily find their stop. This is complemented by a map of the city, with which it is easy to build a further path if the user prefers walking.\n\nCity\n\nThe city map has become much better and more informative. Now you can build routes on public transport, car or bicycle on the city map and follow them. Also added useful features such as traffic jams, search by category, save favorite places to favorites, view the history of your routes and much more.\n\nPassenger's personal account\n\nThe application now has a personal account where you can manage the Troika card online.\nNow, when linking the Troika card to an account in your personal account, do not worry about losing the card – the balance can be transferred to another card.\nSet up automatic replenishment or notification of a decrease in the card balance.\nGet points under the loyalty program \"City\" for replenishing the \"Troika\" card.\nKeep a history of trips and operations performed.\n\n\nChatbot of Alexander\n\nEverything you wanted to know about the subway, but didn't know where to ask. Our chatbot will quickly and amiably answer any questions online.\n\nNow passengers will not need to waste time searching for the necessary information. In a matter of seconds, a virtual interlocutor will help you make an application for the maintenance of the Central control center and the warehouse of forgotten things, give a historical reference about the metro, tell you about the operating mode of stations and closures during repairs, tell you all the necessary addresses and contacts, connect you with the operator if you do not want to communicate with artificial intelligence, and much more.\n\nAlexandra will continue to study, combining it with her main job. We will definitely report on her skills.\n\nOther updates\n\nA dark theme has appeared in the application.\n\nThe news section has been updated. Now the news is divided into 3 categories:\n\nImportant, where up-to-date information about restrictions on metro lines is collected;\n\nNews, where the latest news related to the Moscow Metro will be published\n\nThe official Twitter account of the Moscow Metro for operational information about the work of the metro."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

GPS Phone Tracking functions, features and benefits include:\n\nGreat Friend Locator.\nGPS Phone Tracking uses GPS coordinates and state-of-the-art GPS location data to report the real-time whereabouts of your friends. Simply install the GPS tracker app on your phone and your friends’ phones. Once registered, each friend appears as a unique icon on the GPS Tracking Pro’s navigational map so you’ll know exactly where each friend is, at all times. Want to know instantly which friends arrived at a party, theater, museum or another planned meet up point? Want to figure out if anyone is stuck in traffic, made a wrong turn or even worse – if your habitually late friend has even left his/her house yet? No need to send annoying “Where are your?” or “What’s your ETA?” texts, GPS Phone Tracking puts this information at your fingertips. And to make life super easy, GPS Tracking Pro can send alerts the moment your friends arrive at the appointed location!\n\nFriend Locator\nWith GPS Phone Tracking, you can monitor your friend’s travel from one location to another via the app’s GPS maps. This is a very helpful feature when you’re traveling separately from a friend who has a tendency to get lost often. And let’s face it: GPS Phone Tracking also makes a great family tracker. This is especially helpful if a family member is scheduled to pick you up. You can track their progress toward your destination, enjoying yourself until the last possible moment you have to be at the agreed upon pick up spot!\n\nReliable Cell Phone Tracker\nGPS Phone Tracking can pinpoint the location of registered mobile devices, smart phones and even old school feature phones via the app’s website, 24/7. Just log in and your phone will appear as an icon. Click on the icon to view the location of the missing mobile phone. This GPS phone tracking device helps with iPhone too. It accesses GPS iPhone data to pinpoint the location of missing Droids.\n\nPhone Tracking for Friends With Feature Phones\nFriends who don’t have the latest smart phone (or a smart phone at all), can still enjoy GPS Phone Tracking’s features and benefits – with a little help from their friends! Here’s how it works: The app will send a text invite to the feature phone. Once your friend accepts the invitation and replies with a “yes,” to the text, their individual icon will appear on the app’s GPS maps. If their phone is lost, the app will provide GPS navigation assistance to help you guide them its destination. It’s a phone tracker extraordinaire.\n\nInnovative and Versatile Phone Locator\nDo you constantly misplace your cell phone and are tired of asking other people (friends or family) to help you find it or if they’ve seen it? GPS Phone Tracking can help. Its state-of-the-art GPS system can keep tabs on registered phones, using satellites to triangulate the exact location of every phone registered to your account. If a phone is ever out of satellite view, GPS Phone Tracking uses triangulation via the nearest cell phone tower and the cell phone carrier’s data to determine the missing phone’s location. This versatile phone locator also offers printer-friendly directions to the misplaced phone’s location. GPS Phone Tracking is compatible with iPhone, whether you have AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or another phone carrier."

Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser.

We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.\n\nYou can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.\n\nIf you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details – all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments. \n\nFeedFinder is part of a project by Open Lab Newcastle University, UK.

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

      "label": "HUD Widgets app is a set of handy and popular navigation widgets, like speedometers, trip info, landmeter, weather, eco-driving, etc... All widgets work in regular or head-up display (HUD) mode. \n\nSpeedometers:\n— Classic digital speedometer\n— Digital, with compass, odometer, and distance traveled (Chevrolet Aveo style)\n— A set of retro speedometers: Cadillac style, arched, circular\n\nGPS trip information:\n— See how safely you drive: the app calculates your driving score based on your acceleration, braking, turns, and speeding data. \n— Know your fuel consumption per each trip and the expenses on it.\n— Information on your current, maximum and average speed, distance and time traveled\n— Large compass\n— Eco-driving. Acceleration and deceleration graphs indicate driving efficiency\n\nOther:\n— Internet Radio\n— Land meter. Indicates the angle of car slope or tilt — pitching and rolling\n— Weather and clock\n\nLaunch the app, select the widget, and place the smartphone close to the windshield (to use it in HUD mode, with the screen image reflected onto the windshield), or fix it in the mount. \n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (more at hudwayglass.com or see bellow). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. Continuous use of geolocation services (GPS and GLONASS) may drain your device battery fast.\n\n3. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nHUDWAY Glass car accessory makes smartphone work as a head-up display in any car even in daytime. Removes doubling, offers sharp enlarged reflection image.\nLearn more: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Nice!\"\n\nA simple and uncluttered interface to read:\n• Altitude or Elevation\n• Latitude\n• Longitude\n\nFeatures\n• Highest GPS accuracy for your device\n• Ground elevation from topographical map values\n• View in feet or meters\n• Built-in flashlight\n\nSharing\n• Share screenshots with beautiful backgrounds\n• Share on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, or text message\n\nUse the Custom Background upgrade to take a photo from the top of a mountain and take a screenshot with your altitude overlaid to show your family & friends.\n\nBackgrounds (In-App purchases):\n• Meadow landscape (Illustrated)\n• Cityscape (Illustrated)\n• Mountains (Illustrated)\n• Abstract\n• Choose Your Own\n\nNote: Many customers with high altitude illnesses or sensitivities, such as chronic lung disease, asthma, COPD, & emphysema find this app useful for avoiding high altitudes. It is also used by hikers and climbers who want to avoid high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). However, the altitude shown is potentially subject to large inaccuracies and this app should NOT be used as a primary device for determining altitude for medical reasons."

You can also find the elevation of your current location by using online database, built-in GPS, or barometer on your device.\n\r\n\r\n\nElevation data benefits flood prevention, prediction of water levels in rivers, lakes, and seas, etc. Thus, knowing the elevation of places is very crucial if you are looking for a flood-free house, or planning for a hiking trip, and more.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\n## Could-based Altitude Data ##\r\nThe easiest way to find altitude of any location on earth. By simply point on the screen, you can get the elevation data from a coordinate location point. “Range Mode” is available for altitude comparison (by graph and line) of each point between two selected locations. \n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## GPS Altitude Data ##\r\nUse built-in GPS on your device to determine the altitude of your current location. The altitude data of the area you walked-through will be recorded and displayed as a multicolored line on the map. The colors presented on the line indicate different heights. Precision indicators (horizontal resolution and vertical resolution) are displayed on the screen.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Barometric Altitude Data ##\r\nUse built-in barometer on your device to determine the elevation of your current location. You can either measure the elevation from raw barometric data, or relative pressure from sea-level.

It is not intended to be a replacement for full-featured mobile navigation apps, such as Google Maps or the pre-installed Maps app. Being light-weight means, for example, that it does not let you save offline maps and it does not recalculate routes automatically when you go off-course.

And, of course, it will allow you to navigate GPX files and all other possibilities which are offered in the route planning screen.\n\n---\nSUBSCRIPTION TERMS:\n\nThis app offers the possibility to purchase an auto-renewable subscription: \"Unlock r.485\". The length of this subscription is one year. By subscribing to our service, any content previously blocked in the app, such as the detailed driving instructions, will always be displayed.\n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

(no lite or pro versions required)\n\nNew Zealand (NZ) Topo Map is intended for outdoor enthusiasts who want to mark locations visited or create markers to visit. It does not provide track information, show track routes, record while walking, show speed etc. It's designed to be lightweight, intuitive, responsive, battery conscious and totally free. Perfect for casual day trips to serious bush excursions.\n\nTopographic Map Tiles\n\nThe Topo50 map series provides topographic mapping for the New Zealand mainland and Chatham Islands at 1:50,000 scale.\n\nAt a scale of 1:50,000, Topo50 maps show geographic features in detail. They are useful for a wide range of activities such as local navigation by vehicle or on foot, locality area planning and study of the environment. Used by a wide variety of groups, Topo50 is the official topographic map series used by New Zealand emergency services.\n\nTo produce our Topo50 maps of the New Zealand mainland we use:\n\n• The New Zealand Geodetic Datum 2000 (NZGD2000) – the coordinates of longitude and latitude\n• The New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000 (NZTM2000) projection – this is what enables the curved mathematical surface approximating the Earth to be represented on a flat sheet of paper.\n\nTo produce our Topo50 maps of the Chatham Islands we use the Chatham Islands Transverse Mercator 2000 (CITM2000) projection.\n\nTopo50 map tiles sourced from the LINZ Data Service http://data.linz.govt.nz/ and licensed by LINZ for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence.\n\nSatellite Imagery\n\nLINZ has been working towards getting New Zealand’s most current publicly-owned aerial imagery – covering 95% of the country. \n\nAerial imagery is captured from airborne sensors and cameras. It provides an accurate photographic representation of the earth’s surface and the features on it. It can be used to visualise landscape, or to understand how an area has evolved over time.\n\nSourced from the LINZ Data Service and licensed for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence (http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/licensing-and-using-data/attributing-aerial-imagery-data)"

Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

Los usuarios registrados podrán hacer uso de la opción de favoritos pudiendo guardar las rutas o paradas de uso frecuente. \nEl mapa incluye una opción que permite activar una capa de tráfico, la cual provee de información en tiempo real sobre el estado de las vías, pudiendo identificar mediante las líneas rojas los trayectos más congestionados.\nMediante el menú de la aplicación los usuarios pueden tener acceso a las siguientes funcionalidades:\n- Paradas a mí alrededor: esta opción en el sistema muestra la ubicación del usuario en el mapa, mediante el uso del GPS de su dispositivo, permitiendo visualizar las paradas más cercanas, sin necesidad de escribir el nombre de la ubicación. Al seleccionar la parada podrá obtener el pronóstico de arribo del bus a la parada, en tiempo real.\n\n-Ubicación del bus: Permite realizar búsquedas tanto por ruta como por parada, y despliega de forma visual, en tiempo real, todos los buses que circulan por dicha ruta. Mediante el uso de colores se puede visualizar el estado del tráfico entre cada parada.\n\n-Búsqueda del trayecto: Permite planificar su viaje indicando el origen y destino, tomando información de los viajes programados, pudiendo realizar combinaciones entre el uso de Metro bus o metro. Adicionalmente puede indicar opciones que permiten ordenar los resultados de acuerdo a: el mejor trayecto, menos transferencias o menos caminata.  \n\n-Noticias: mediante está opción podrá visualizar los principales cambios operativos que puedan tener un impacto en la normal ejecución de los servicios.\n\n-Favoritos: Permite al usuario almacenar las pardas y rutas de uso frecuente.\n\nLos tiempos que presenta la aplicación son estimaciones muy próximas al tiempo real que ejecutan las unidades de MiBus, estas indicaciones se ofrecen solo a modo de información. Es posible que las obras viales, cambios climáticos, el tráfico u otros factores hagan variar el pronóstico ofrecido por la aplicación. Los tiempos se actualizan constantemente por lo que se considera normal que puedan existir variaciones de un momento a otro para ajustar los resultados a la realidad de cada ruta."

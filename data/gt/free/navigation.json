Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser.

All widgets work in regular or head-up display (HUD) mode. \n\nSpeedometers:\n— Classic digital speedometer\n— Digital, with compass, odometer, and distance traveled (Chevrolet Aveo style)\n— A set of retro speedometers: Cadillac style, arched, circular\n\nGPS trip information:\n— See how safely you drive: the app calculates your driving score based on your acceleration, braking, turns, and speeding data. \n— Know your fuel consumption per each trip and the expenses on it.\n— Information on your current, maximum and average speed, distance and time traveled\n— Large compass\n— Eco-driving. Acceleration and deceleration graphs indicate driving efficiency\n\nOther:\n— Internet Radio\n— Land meter. Indicates the angle of car slope or tilt — pitching and rolling\n— Weather and clock\n\nLaunch the app, select the widget, and place the smartphone close to the windshield (to use it in HUD mode, with the screen image reflected onto the windshield), or fix it in the mount. \n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (more at hudwayglass.com or see bellow). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. Continuous use of geolocation services (GPS and GLONASS) may drain your device battery fast.\n\n3. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nHUDWAY Glass car accessory makes smartphone work as a head-up display in any car even in daytime. Removes doubling, offers sharp enlarged reflection image.\nLearn more: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

      "label": "Speedometer by HUDWAY offers a brand new way to control speed when driving. A remedy against the speeding tickets, the app keeps you aware on what speed limitation is set for the current road section and alerts when you're exceeding it.\n\nThe app is straight and handy, with no tricky settings. Launch the app and place the phone onto the dashboard close to the windshield (if you want to use it in Head-Up Display or HUD mode and see the reflection on the windshield), or into the mount (for standard use).  It's specifically designed to offer you a safe and non-distracting visual assistance.\n\nPerfectly works in the background — tracks your speed and gives sound alerts when you're exceeding, even when you're using some other app (for example, some navigation one).\n\nHUDWAY Speedometer is a good company in any journey as it:\nKnows current speed limitation (both within cities and on highways);\nWorks in both standard and HUD mode. HUD mode allows using your smartphone or tablet as a projector. Just place your device close to the windshield, and the screen image will get reflected and displayed on the windshield. Keep your eyes on the road — everything you need is displayed right in front of you!\nDoesn't require much attention. The app is designed to be comfortably used without direct focus on it. Your peripheral sight will be enough to keep you aware.\nAlerts on sped limits, as well as on speed cameras and radars.\nDoesn't need Internet connection to work. Needs Internet only at first launch.\nIt simply works. And does it very neatly!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $4.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

      "label": "FeedFinder has been designed with breastfeeding mothers to provide an easy and convenient tool for finding and sharing good places for breastfeeding.\n\nWe'll show you on a handy map all of the places near you that have been reviewed by other mothers. We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.\n\nYou can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.\n\nIf you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details – all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments. \n\nFeedFinder is part of a project by Open Lab Newcastle University, UK. Check out http://feed-finder.co.uk/ for more details."

      "label": "INTRODUCTION\nThis application allows to the user to make surveys using integrated GPS with its nominal precision, in a fast and easy way.\nIt can be used by surveyors and other technicians for surveys consisting on measuring lots, paths, crops, pipes, electrical lines, urban furniture...\nApple Maps is used as background, and can be represented in standard, satellite, hybrid and relief modes. Geographic or UTM projected coordinates are shown at all times.\n\nPOINT SURVEY\nThe application allows data collection of single points, whose coordinates are got from the GPS, showing the estimated precision by a circle, as is usual in location-based programs.\nThe points are automatically numbered, recording date and time, and can be separated in different layers. User can also enter point codes, choosing them from a quick list.\n\nCONTINUOUS SURVEY\nIt is also possible to perform a continuous survey, recording vertices automatically by an interval of time, distance or height difference.\nAt any time you can view the polyline data, such as minimum and maximum heights, length and area. Vertex information can be displayed as well.\nYou can work with multiple layers, with different names and colors.\n\nRESULTS\nSurvey can be exported to a KML file, that can be sent by email from the app. This file can also be imported by TcpMDT and other CAD and GIS applications.\n\nSETTINGS\nEditing preferences lets you to change the appearance of map, points and lines captured. It also sets parameters for data collection, information displayed in real time and others.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n• Operating System: iOS 7 or higher\n• Integrated GPS\n• Internet access"

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield.

Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe.

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

Welcome to sustainable mobility!\n\n* Do you want to know when the next bus will arrive to your stop, or even get an automatic notification a few minutes before?\n* Or which is the best combination of buses to get to any point in the city?\n* Or how to swiftly move inside Palma combining buses and public bikes?\n* Or how to make sure that your BiciPalma trip closed correctly when you leave your bike in its anchor point?\n\nMobiPalma provides real-time, geolocated information on traffic conditions, the location and occupancy level of parking and public bicycle stations, in addition to all the information on the EMT Palma bus network. It's a free app and it's available in Catalán, Spanish, English and German.\n\nMobiPalma is jointly promoted by the Department of Mobility of Palma de Mallorca City Hall, Emt Palma and SMAP (which manages public parkings and Bicipalma).\n\nWith the MobiPalma app you will be able to:\n\n* Get bus arrival times exactly as in the EMT Palma app, but now also without knowing the bus stop number: choose your bus stop directly on the map; search directly by stop number, seeing the matches as you type; use the new text search engine for locating stops by street name. You can also get the bus arrival time from other screens of the app such as line information.\n\n* Calculate routes between a source and a destination using the bus network or using different combinations of bus, public bike and parkings. You can set the source and destination of the route by searching for street names or places: a hotel, a restaurant, a bar, a shop or a mall... And of course, you can select any point directly on a map of the city that shows your location.\n\n* Consult the information on all bus lines and all bus stops on the network.\n\n* View the closest stops to your location represented on the city map.\n\n\n* Schedule automatic reminders to be at the stop at the right time and don't miss the bus anymore.\n\n* Mark your usual bus stops as favorites and save them with a name for convenience.\n\n* Add to Favorites screen: bus lines, the combination of line and bus stop, Bicipalma bike stations, public car parks, urban road sections with data traffic congestion data and public traffic cameras.\n\n* Check at a glance the status of all your favorites by just opening the app (since \"Your Favorites\" is the initial screen), and even see the arrival time of your favorite stop-line combinations without touching the screen.\n\n* View on a map the congestion status of the main roads of the city.\n\n* Take a look at the live feed of various public traffic cameras.\n\n* Go with your car to a car park knowing in advance the number of available slots and compare the price with other nearby parking options.\n\n* Go to a BiciPalma bike station knowing in advance the number of available bikes and open anchor points, as well as any unusable ones.\n\n* Automatically receive a 25, 30 and 60 minutes after the bike caught push notification (provided it has not already been returned to an anchor.)\n\n* Check from within the app your Bicipalma usage history and, for example, make sure the trip closed correctly when you left the bike in its anchor point, or see any penalty for extra time.\n\n* Be informed of any incident in public roads and in the transport network, regardless of the sender: Town Hall, EMT Palma or SMAP. Notices on important incidents are sent as an automatic notification to your phone, and you can always disable it in the Settings screen."

      "label": "fDeck is an aircraft flight deck in your pocket that provides real-world functionality to a suite of full-featured, graphically beautiful flight instruments for your mobile device.\n\nIt allows you to virtually tune any radio aid from a worldwide aviation database, or create your own 'virtual' radio aids whever you want to practice radio navigation. Use the app as a training aid, or use it as a set of complimentary flight instruments when flying.  \n\nIn addition to the beautiful flight deck instruments, fDeck also has a built-in aviation moving map that shows your location as well as relevant airspace, airport and weather and navigation data. You can move your location on the map to reposition your virtual aircraft and the flight instruments will reflect this new location. This allows you to use fDeck as a radio navigation trainer - you can see in real-time what the VOR, HSI or NDB will look like at your new location!\n\nThe following instruments are currently available in the app:\n\n• Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)\n• VHF Omnidirectional Range Receiver (VOR)\n• Automatic Direction Finder (ADF)\n• Artificial Horizon\n• Groundspeed Indicator\n• Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI) \n• Aircraft Compass, with functioning heading bug\n• Altimeter - with functioning barometric pressure adjustments\n• Chronometer with fuel totaliser\n• Weather and Wind - display current live weather and wind information including head/crosswind components\n\nIf you use the X-Plane flight simulator you can even drive the flight instruments straight from X-Plane!\n\nKey features:\n\n• Instruments are proudly graphically accurate with ultra smooth animations\n• Grid and Swipe user interface modes\n• Go full-screen to focus on a single instrument, or use multiple of the same type\n• Tune each instrument slot to a different radio station\n• Simulate flight by panning your location on the map - use the app as a radio aids trainer!\n• Worldwide aviation database containing over 20k airports and radio navigation aids, updated monthly\n• Fully searchable navigation database, filterable by type\n• Map view with aviation overlays showing location and tuned radio stations\n• Each instrument has an associated video tutorial\n• Add your own navaids - want to practice VOR radial tracking on your house - now you can!\n• Supports tablets and phones and both portrait and landscape orientations\n\nThis app has taken years of work by the developer, who provides it free for your use. The app does have in-app ads. By joining the fDeck Premium Lounge via an in-app subscription or one-time purchase you can remove all in-app ads, remove the 5 user station limitation, get monthly navigation database updates and get unlimited access to the X-Plane fDeck connector.\n\nIf you have any issues, please consider contacting me directly instead of giving a negative rating - most times your issues can be solved or answered. A rating will not get your app to work or a new feature added, but an email might - simply use the integrated \"Contact the developer\" function on the app settings page.\n\nAny payments or subscriptions will be charged to your account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless cancelled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime through your account settings.

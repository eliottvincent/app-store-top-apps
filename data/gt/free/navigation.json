We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.\n\nYou can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.\n\nIf you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details – all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments. \n\nFeedFinder is part of a project by Open Lab Newcastle University, UK.

Geographic or UTM projected coordinates are shown at all times.\n\nPOINT SURVEY\nThe application allows data collection of single points, whose coordinates are got from the GPS, showing the estimated precision by a circle, as is usual in location-based programs.\nThe points are automatically numbered, recording date and time, and can be separated in different layers. User can also enter point codes, choosing them from a quick list.\n\nCONTINUOUS SURVEY\nIt is also possible to perform a continuous survey, recording vertices automatically by an interval of time, distance or height difference.\nAt any time you can view the polyline data, such as minimum and maximum heights, length and area. Vertex information can be displayed as well.\nYou can work with multiple layers, with different names and colors.\n\nRESULTS\nSurvey can be exported to a KML file, that can be sent by email from the app. This file can also be imported by TcpMDT and other CAD and GIS applications.\n\nSETTINGS\nEditing preferences lets you to change the appearance of map, points and lines captured. It also sets parameters for data collection, information displayed in real time and others.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n• Operating System: iOS 7 or higher\n• Integrated GPS\n• Internet access"

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One!

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "AIS MARINE TRAFFIC INFORMATION\n\nNow we can sea!  AIS marine traffic information directly in the application for free!\nA user friendly interface for AIS marine traffic is finally here.\nForget about busy and loaded screens with thousands of dots that make information difficult to understand. Now terrestrial AIS information is intelligently shown for an easy understanding.\nIs your favorite anchoring spot busy? Is your best fishing spot taken? Now you can identify vessels, traffic in a certain area and take the best decisions where to navigate.\n\nIQ Traffic - SMARTPHONE BASED REAL MARINE TIME TRAFFIC\n\nTogether, safer on water! Introducing our innovative smart marine traffic that uses smartphone technology. Even if your boat does not have AIS, your smartphone acts like one showing you as an anonymous boat only when you are on water.  This only if you decide to create a flotilla and only if you are on water.\nThis way, everyone contributes to a safer boating experience with real time marine traffic information not available before. Be sure to spread the word to other boaters!\n\nFLOTILLA MODE\n\nDo you want to see in real time the location of your friends on other boats for easier coordination? Just create a flotilla and invite your skipper friends to it. The moment they accept and they are on water you will be able to “sea” the location information of all flotilla members for easier coordination as a group, details of each flotilla member such as: current speed, distance relative to your location, their GPS coordinates \nNow you can better plan your approaches, you can easily reach them in case they need support or join them in that perfect swimming location! \n\nPERSONAL BESTS\n\nAre you the lead skipper of your flotilla? Now you can actually prove it. \nThe app automatically logs your personal bests such as overall nautical miles covered, highest speed reached or longest leg when you are in a flotilla. \nIt is smart enough not to log your on land activities so no worries if you hop on a scooter on an island. Your land activities are not tracked or logged so your on water record stays clean and accurate. \n\nPRIVACY WHEN ON LAND \n\nWe listened! A smart solution should provide information when needed. That is why we designed our application so that it will not show your location to other flotilla members when you are on land. It will show only your last logged on water location."

Whether you want a scenic, winding route or the fastest way from A to B, voice commands and the clear TFT display with arrows providing directions will guide you and your motorbike safely to your destination.

We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

Keep your eyes on the road and know in advance what’s ahead — a straight run, or a ramp-turn. This is especially handy when driving between cities.\n\nFeatures:\n- Intuitive 3D map, simple navigation\n- Voice Assistance\n- Speed limits\n- Long tap on the map to set the destination\n- Fuel consumption calculation\n- Transit points\n- Search for addresses and POI\n- Choose alternative routes\n- Drive offline right after you start\n- The app will recalculate the route if you leave it\n- Classic GPS map navigation mode\n- Head-up display (HUD) mode\n- Trip info: ETA, speed, distance traveled, directions on the next manoeuvre, and more\n- Based on OpenStreetMap (OSM)\n\nNote: If you face any problems or find any bugs, please email us at support@hudwayapp.com or report the bug right from the app.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $2.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nIf you want to use HUD during a day-time — there is a special accessory HUDWAY Glass: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

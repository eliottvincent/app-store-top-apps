It supports HTML 5 + CSS 3, and is based in Webkit. \n\nCroPlus gives you the power to take back control of your Web experience. That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities. Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser. As such, it inherits all the Midori functionalities. It supports many of the most popular parts of the web, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify and Rdio."

      "label": "Speed Limit App displays the current speed limit and your current speed. It detects European speed limit signs using the camera while driving and enhances the results by map based limits from OpenStreetMap. Thus it will even know limits which are not indicated by signs (i.e. Zone 30, or inner city areas). Of course it will warn you when you are too fast. \n\n► Working principle of Speed Limit App\nSpeed Limit App is a road sign recognition app. For inner city limits we use map based information from OpenStreetMap. Both information is merged to provide an optimal limit indication. The speedometer gets its data from the GPS and is used to determine wether you are above or below the actual limit of the last detected road sign.\n\n► Limitations of Speed Limit App\nSpeedometer Radar Camera does a computational intensive job that formerly was limited to mainframes. Therefore there are some restrictions:\n\n- At night and in adverse lighting conditions the recognition of road signs might fail due to iPhone camera limitations.\n- The app is optimized for European road signs. Unfortunately there is yet no support for US speed limits.\n- There is no support for 'end of limit' signs yet and no support for place/city signs that might also decrease the speed limit according to local traffic road regulations.\n- Sometimes road signs in narrow turns are missed due to the limited view angle of the camera\n- Sometimes there are missed or false road sign detections\n- Speedometer is updated every second\n\n► Notes from the developer\nIf you like Speed Limit warning Camera please rate the app. If you don't like it please send your suggestions by email to the developer team. If you want to get it ad-free please get the IAP and bear in mind that developing such a complicated app requires knowledge and time which should be rewarded. Please refrain from complaining about the pricing policy.\n\n► Disclaimer for Speedometer Radar Camera\nThe author of this app takes no liability whatsoever for any damages that may occur in connection with this app. In particular, all claims against the author are excluded. By using the app, the user recognizes this complete exclusion of liability and damage compensation.

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

At the push of a button Tides Planner allows you to see tides for 8,000+ WORLDWIDE locations.  NO CONNECTION REQUIRED as the app has its own database.\n\nOne tap to tides for your favourites. Advanced users can take advantage of extensive tools to calculate time windows for entering/leaving and clearing depths. \n\nFEATURES\n- Tidal graphs\n- Week ahead tide table\n- Minimum/maximum depths\n- Chart depth/actual depth\n- Standard port information\n- Spinning globe for rapid location search\n- Search by name\n- Time of sunrise/sunset, dawn/twilight\n- Moon phases, rise/set\n- Date of spring/neap tides\n- Notepad and copy/paste + email\n- Favourites and recents\n- Scrolling scales\n- Coefficients (France)\n- Currents (UK, Ireland, North Sea, Netherlands and parts of the German coast)\n\nFrom version 3.0 enhanced predictions for Europe based on our own constituent analysis system. Other countries to follow.\n\nGEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE\nWorldwide coverage. Some countries have time limits from the national Hydrographic Office.\n\nTIME COVERAGE\nThe app gives access to all its features, but the free initial download is limited to tides for one day. To get future predictions use the Extensions within the app (In App purchase):\n- Year on year: use the extensions within the app (In App purchases) to enable future predictions. \n\n- In certain countries get a Hydrographic Licence to remove restrictions.\n\nHYDROGRAPHIC OFFICE LICENCES\nDuring a valid year:\n- Italy, USA, Canada (main ports), Australia, New Zealand, Japan and other countries: ANY DAY in the year.\n- Denmark, Spain, Portugal, South Africa, Oman, Argentina: SEVEN DAYS at a time.\n\nThe following can be extended with a Hydrographic Office Licence to remove country restrictions:\n- UK, Ireland, Germany and all UKHO ports: change from seven days to ANY DAY.\n- Netherlands: change from seven days to ANY DAY.\n- Belgium: change from seven days to ANY DAY.\n- France and SHOM ports: from one day to ANY DAY.\n\nEach Hydrographic Office Licence is ONLY PURCHASED ONCE and applies to all Valid Years.\n\nABOUT US\nImray: publishers of nautical charts, books and apps. Look out for other applications in the Marine Navigation Series from Imray.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/imray_charts\nFacebook/Imray-Laurie-Norie-Wilson-Ltd-304115312941493\n\nLANGUAGES\nEnglish, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese\n\nABOUT PREDICTIONS\nPredictions are based on the harmonic method, using constants from the Hydro offices (UKHO, SHOM, NOAA, BOM, CHS etc). There are differences between the app predictions and the official Hydro office tide tables, as these are based on large numbers of constants that are not made publicly available.  The Hydro offices consider the harmonic methods used in this product appropriate for navigation.\n\nAlways consult tidal curves and take into account local weather (pressure and wind) and swell conditions, which can have a very significant effect on sea water levels."

Keep your eyes on the road and know in advance what’s ahead — a straight run, or a ramp-turn. This is especially handy when driving between cities.\n\nFeatures:\n- Intuitive 3D map, simple navigation\n- Voice Assistance\n- Speed limits\n- Long tap on the map to set the destination\n- Fuel consumption calculation\n- Transit points\n- Search for addresses and POI\n- Choose alternative routes\n- Drive offline right after you start\n- The app will recalculate the route if you leave it\n- Classic GPS map navigation mode\n- Head-up display (HUD) mode\n- Trip info: ETA, speed, distance traveled, directions on the next manoeuvre, and more\n- Based on OpenStreetMap (OSM)\n\nNote: If you face any problems or find any bugs, please email us at support@hudwayapp.com or report the bug right from the app.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $2.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nIf you want to use HUD during a day-time — there is a special accessory HUDWAY Glass: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

The app is ideal during trips, sports, treasure hunting (geocaching), solo travel and any other activities out in the world that require location data.\r\n\r\nIn the basic view you will see following data:\r\n- latitude and longitude in formats:\r\n- decimal degrees\r\n    - degrees, decimal minutes\r\n    - degrees, minutes, seconds\r\n    - UTM\r\n- altitude\r\n- GPS accuracy\r\n- speed (km/h, m/s, mph)\r\n- direction\r\n- location address (if available)\r\n\r\nIn addition, on the main view screen, you can save your exact location and take a photo and our application will plot any data you wish on it.\r\n\r\nIn the map view, you can see your current position and saved locations as well as add new places. Thanks to this function, you can easily find beautiful beaches from last summer, hidden treasures, favorite restaurants or even a place to park your car. To add a new place, just press and hold a button and then enter the name. You can switch to four different map types - normal, terrain, hybrid, satellite. In this view, a coordinates finder is available based on your current address - all you need to do is enter the address and the application will determine the location data, such as latitude and longitude or vice versa.\r\n\r\nOn the history screen you will see all of your saved places. A chronological sorting is also available, in alphabetical order, based on distance from your current location. The application displays the name of the place, save date, latitude and longitude, distance from current position based on WGS84, direction and saved photos. An interesting feature is the possibility of transferring a given place to another person using our application and the import / export function. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the app makes it possible to provide an up-to-date GPS location with a link to Google Maps via text message, email, FB messenger, and other available options. This is especially useful in dangerous situations where you have no access to data transmission.\r\n\nTerms and conditions:  https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/mygpslocation\nPrivacy policy: https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/mygpslocation"

This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

      "label": "Moovit is one app for all your urban mobility and transit rides. \n\nTransportation is an integral part of urban living. Whether you ride the train, subway, bus, light rail, ferry or metro, use dockless scooters, bikes, ride-sharing like Uber or Lyft, getting the best urban mobility information is critical. Enter Moovit! Moovit provides riders with a one-stop-shop journey experience to help them get from point A to B in the easiest and most efficient way. Get train and bus times, maps, and real-time arrival information with ease so that you can plan your trip with confidence. Pay and validate your rides.

Get step-by-step directions of optimal route bus, train, metro, bike, scooter or a combination of them. \n\nMoovit guides more than 930 million users in over 3400 cities throughout the world. Commuters will find updated bus and train times, transit maps, and, where available, real-time line arrivals. Locate nearby bus stops and train stations, travel with on-the-go live navigation guidance, receive get-off alerts when approaching your destination to ensure a smooth ride. That's why Moovit has been named one of the best apps of the year in 2017 by the App Store.\n\nMoovit is your personal assistant for all your transit rides! \n\n► Real-time arrivals. View real-time arrival information, which is taken directly from GPS devices positioned on buses and trains. Avoid wasting time guessing train times or bus times.\n\n► Digital payment. Purchase bus & train tickets and validate your digital pass with a tap (select cities). \n\n► Real time alerts. Know about issues ahead of time by receiving service alerts such as emergency or unexpected disruptions, delays, traffic jams, new construction, and more so that you can plan ahead if your bus time or train time changed.\n\n► Live Directions.

Plus, get real-time updates if/when there are changes to your favorite lines in case your bus time or train time is impacted!\n\n► Bike routes. Get bike routes in addition to the bus, subway, train, or metro trip plans. If you ride bikes (yours or shared) we can plan a route that includes the train or bus. Moovit will help you plan a trip that meets your transit-needs. Bike docking stations are updated in real-time. Bike trip plans are only available in supported metro areas.\n\n► Maps view. Interested in seeing the whole picture? View all stations, routes, and lines on the subway or bus map.

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

Keep your eyes on the road and know in advance what’s ahead — a straight run, or a ramp-turn. This is especially handy when driving between cities.\n\nFeatures:\n- Intuitive 3D map, simple navigation\n- Voice Assistance\n- Speed limits\n- Long tap on the map to set the destination\n- Fuel consumption calculation\n- Transit points\n- Search for addresses and POI\n- Choose alternative routes\n- Drive offline right after you start\n- The app will recalculate the route if you leave it\n- Classic GPS map navigation mode\n- Head-up display (HUD) mode\n- Trip info: ETA, speed, distance traveled, directions on the next manoeuvre, and more\n- Based on OpenStreetMap (OSM)\n\nNote: If you face any problems or find any bugs, please email us at support@hudwayapp.com or report the bug right from the app.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $2.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nIf you want to use HUD during a day-time — there is a special accessory HUDWAY Glass: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

All widgets work in regular or head-up display (HUD) mode. \n\nSpeedometers:\n— Classic digital speedometer\n— Digital, with compass, odometer, and distance traveled (Chevrolet Aveo style)\n— A set of retro speedometers: Cadillac style, arched, circular\n\nGPS trip information:\n— See how safely you drive: the app calculates your driving score based on your acceleration, braking, turns, and speeding data. \n— Know your fuel consumption per each trip and the expenses on it.\n— Information on your current, maximum and average speed, distance and time traveled\n— Large compass\n— Eco-driving. Acceleration and deceleration graphs indicate driving efficiency\n\nOther:\n— Internet Radio\n— Land meter. Indicates the angle of car slope or tilt — pitching and rolling\n— Weather and clock\n\nLaunch the app, select the widget, and place the smartphone close to the windshield (to use it in HUD mode, with the screen image reflected onto the windshield), or fix it in the mount. \n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (more at hudwayglass.com or see bellow). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. Continuous use of geolocation services (GPS and GLONASS) may drain your device battery fast.\n\n3. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nHUDWAY Glass car accessory makes smartphone work as a head-up display in any car even in daytime. Removes doubling, offers sharp enlarged reflection image.\nLearn more: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

This App gives you the ability to find out all the details of the ship, including size, speed, course, destination, estimated time of arrival and much more. All done with an easy to use and great looking App, which supports both iPhone and iPad.\n\nWhat people are saying about our App: \"Best user interface of any ship app I have tried\" B. Colson, Maine. \"Love the graphical design and the large icons that makes it easy to determine the ship type\" R. Clark, London. \n\nOpenSeaMap data is now accessible from within the app giving the possibility of showing the map data delivered by OpenSeaMap which includes seamarks, navigational rules and buoys in many areas of the world.\n\nFurthermore, you may measure the distance to the ships from your position, as you may measure distance between any two ships. This will show you if they are really on collision course or if it's just an illusion.\n\nSee the ships displayed on the map with large and crystal clear icons.\n\nBuilt-in compass and \"direction\" vector which helps find the direction of the ships and vessels. \n\nFurthermore, images of the ships may be watched or uploaded directly from the app.\n\nThis version supports iOS split screen multitasking found on selected device.\n\nAlso we added the possibility to place user defined waypoints on the map (press and hold your finger on map). The waypoints can be used as measurement points from the user or between ships. Furthermore, by pressing the waypoint the position is copied to the clipboard, making it easy to paste positions into other applications. Pressing the callout of the waypoint will prepare a text message with the position ready to send to other users.Once the text message is received the user can press it and get the position up in various maps apps. This functionality has been requested by search and rescue workers who would like a tool to help pin point positions to colleagues out at sea.\n\nMake sure to check out our FREE version of the app (Trackaship Superlite) before buying if in doubt about the coverage of you local area. The free version will show the same ships, but not any details.\n\nThis app depends on the data received via the Internet and is dependent on the Internet for displaying data. \n\nData is collected on a voluntary basis and may change without notice. If you live in an area with poor or no coverage, you have possibility to improve the situation. Send an email to bbmtrackers@gmail.com and we will contact you. \n\nPlease note that the accuracy and reliability of data in this app are not covered by any guarantee and that, under no circumstances should be used for navigation. This app is no substitute for proper maritime instruments."

Whether you want a scenic, winding route or the fastest way from A to B, voice commands and the clear TFT display with arrows providing directions will guide you and your motorbike safely to your destination.

We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

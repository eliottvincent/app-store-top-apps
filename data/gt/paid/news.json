Find out how close and how big it was with iFeltThat, the most customizable worldwide earthquake app for the iPhone and iPod touch.\n\niFeltThat retrieves information directly from official USGS sources to show you seven days of microquake activity as low as magnitude 1.0 in most U.S. regions. Earthquake lists for U.S. regions show you precisely where an event occurred (not just \"Northern California,\" but \"5 mi SE of Santa Rosa, CA\"). Rotate any list view to see the region-wide map. You can also see at a glance how many citizens reported the event to the USGS \"Did You Feel It?\" service\n\nIn addition to 20 region-specific event listings around the world (visit support page for a complete list), iFeltThat features a Nearby region, which uses your current location as a center point. Add an unlimited number of center points from your Address Book to keep an eye on seismic activity near your family and friends (or your own hometown while you travel) down to magnitude 1.0 in the U.S. (4.5 elsewhere). Or set a center point from any event location around the world to monitor earthquake swarms within 500 miles of the center point.\n\nView single-event and interactive region-wide maps in roadmap or satellite hybrid styles. All maps are pinch-zoomable and draggable, just like the Maps app. Optional one-touch zoom buttons in detail maps let you zoom in and out quickly for one-handed operation while on the go. Tap the Newer and Older buttons to navigate instantly from quake detail to quake detail without having to go back to the list.\n\nWhenever a ••USGS Shake Map•• is available for an event, a special icon appears in that event's detail view. Tap the icon to see the Shake Map within iFeltThat. In fact, all related web pages (including direct access to North American and Pacific/Indian Ocean ••Tsunami Warnings••) appear inside the app. Also from inside the app, send an email with info, links, and a screenshot of an event detail screen/map to anyone you like.\n\nCustomize which four regions are ready to view at a single tap on the bottom bar. For each region list, set the minimum magnitude threshold and default map zoom level.\n\nOne earthquake may have brought you to iFeltThat. You'll be so intrigued monitoring unexpected earth movements near you and around the world that you may find yourself using IFeltThat more often than you check the weather or news."

However, some sites set up their feeds to only show a portion of each entry, you know, to get you to click through to their actual website. We find that really annoying, and we're sure you do too.\n\nWhich is why, unlike other RSS feed readers, that either push you into a browser (in-app or otherwise), or depend on third party text parsing services and require you to be online to fetch the full text of one article at a time (which makes it no different from having to click/tap through to a website), in lire, you get your favorite RSS feeds as they should've been. You don't need to click through to any website (though, you do still have the option to, if you really wanted). It takes your favorite partial feeds, does its magic, and converts them in to full feeds, so you don't have to click/tap on those annoying 'Read more' or 'Continue reading' links.\n\nOnce they're cached, you don't even need to be connected to read your full-text feeds.\n\nUse as a standalone feed reader, sync with iCloud,\n\nor,\n\nsync with any of the several services: Feedly, Feedbin, FeedHQ, The Old Reader, Inoreader, BazQux Reader, Newsblur, Feed Wrangler, FreshRSS, Miniflux, Nextcloud News, Tiny Tiny RSS."

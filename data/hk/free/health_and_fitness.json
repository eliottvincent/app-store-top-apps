Visit records will be automatically removed after 31 days.\n\nIf there is confirmed case in a venue located in Hong Kong, the mobile app will notify those users who have visited the same venue at the same time with the infected person(s), thus increasing vigilance and self-protection awareness of citizens as well as enhancing public confidence in visiting different venues.\n\nUpon confirmation by Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, app users who are confirmed positive or preliminary positive of COVID-19 infection can share their visit history with the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health to help trace the relevant contacts.\n\nThe mobile app allows the app users to store their Vaccine Pass records (e.g. COVID-19 vaccination records, vaccination medical exemption certificate and recovery record, provisional vaccine pass) and testing record. The mobile app automatic displays the app users selected Vaccine Pass QR code after scanning a venue QR code to facilitate the compliance with the “Vaccine Pass” measure. The Vaccine Pass QR code stored in the mobile app will be changed to red color if it is belonged to a COVID-19 infected person, and to amber code if it is belonged to a person under medical surveillance according to Department of Health’s records for the purpose of fighting the pandemic.\n\nThe mobile app also provides a Testing Registration Code function to enable app users to voluntarily store their personal information in advance. This function aims to reduce the time spent on queuing on-site and registration at testing points through a simplified registration process for app users to conduct COVID-19 nucleic acid testing if needed.\n\nThe LeaveHomeSafe mobile app is developed under the supervision by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer of The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/privacy \nPersonal Information Collection Statement: https://www.leavehomesafe.gov.hk/en/personal-information-collection-statement"

You can also build your own.\n\n• Build a support network – Strava’s about celebrating movement. Here you’ll find your community and cheer each other on.\n\n• Train smarter – get data insights to understand your progress and see how you improve. Your Training Log is the record of all your workouts.\n\n• Move safer – share your real-time location with loved ones while outdoors for an extra layer of safety.\n\n• Sync your favorite apps and devices – Strava is compatible with thousands of them (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin – you name it).\n\n• Join and create challenges – join millions in monthly challenges to chase new goals, collect digital badges and stay accountable.\n\n• Embrace the unfiltered – your feed on Strava is filled with real efforts from real people. That’s how we motivate each other.\n\n• Whether you’re a world-class athlete or a total beginner, you belong here. Just record and go.\n\nStrava includes both a free version and a subscription version with premium features.\nStrava uses HealthKit to export your Strava activities into the Health app and to read heart rate and biometric data.\n\nYou can subscribe and pay on the App Store, using your Apple ID.

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

It aims to provide novel and personalized mental health self-help services to facilitate progressive improvement of your self-care skills and mental well-being.\nJCTH+ is based on the stratified stepped care approach, first assessing your mental health status and needs, then suggesting tools and interventions of varying levels of intensity, including online self-help tools and face-to-face events. \nTo ensure the quality and effectiveness of our services, all exercises and courses were created under the supervision of clinical psychologists and are based on the latest clinical therapeutic protocols and psychological theories.\n\n[You can enjoy...]\n-----For all members-----\n1) MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT: Keep track of your emotional fluctuations and current state \n2) CHATBOT: Explore through conversations \n3) ARTICLES: Nourish your mind, deepen your understanding and tackle stigma through psychological research \n4) ONLINE WEBINARS: Sharing from clinical psychologists \n\n-----For members with mild to severe emotional distress-----\n5) PSYCHOLOGICAL SELF-HELP COURSES\nAllow clinical psychologists to guide you to understand and face your emotions. Courses include “mindfulness-based training”, “rumination-focused cognitive behavioral training”, and “transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral training”. These courses will help you to reduce being led around by your emotions, getting to the root of why “more resistance leads to more suffering” and “why I cannot muster the energy to do anything”.\n6) MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT\nThe platform houses more than 100 different exercises, including mindfulness, relaxation and thought observation, mood diary and virtual planning exercises. You can also set reminders to help to turn self-care into a habit. \n7) COACHING AND SUGGESTIONS OF DIFFERENT LEVEL OF INTENSITY\nTrained HeartGuides (psychological well-being officers) will address questions that might arise as you journey through the courses, answer questions such as “What to do when emotions are overwhelming?” “The more I try to concentrate the more distracted I get, how to remedy that?”; support and advice will be given according to your progress. You can also sign up for mindfulness group practices and group therapies to augment your self-learning. \n\n[Target audience]\nUnderstanding and learning how to take care of your mental health is important for everyone, not just those with psychological distress. This platform is geared towards working adults (including corporate employees, teachers, healthcare workers, individuals who are experiencing un/underemployment). \n\n[Details]\nPlease visit the JCTourHeart+ website: \nhttps://www.jcthplus.org/\nRegister for free, become a member, start the tour to your heart.\n\n[Disclaimer]\nOur platform is currently unable to offer any form of counseling or immediate emotional assistance. If needed, please consult other professionals."

      "label": "Games that move you.\n\nActive Arcade is a fresh take on how to get active while having fun, just by playing a few simple games. It puts you inside the game and uses your natural body movement as the game controller. Interactive elements will make you feel like you're immersed in an entirely new type of arcade game. It's a whole new world of play.\n\n__\n\nWhile we all want to be healthy, fitness today is expensive, rigorous, time-consuming, and intimidating. In short, “fitness” today is just too hard for many.\n\nActive Arcade is an entirely different approach. It’s a simple, natural way to get active just by playing fun games that use your body movement. Like the casual sports games that we play on the playground as kids, there is no better way to have fun and get your body moving than by playing and competing in physical games. Active Arcade is built for anyone to get moving with only their mobile device—no expensive equipment, no hardcore routines, no wearables.\n\nEven if just for a few minutes a day, moving through Active Arcade is both fun and good for you. Simply use your body to play fun physical games and activities, and get immersed in the gameplay. You won't even know you’re working up a sweat!\n\nDon't exercise. Just play.\n\n__\n\nA NEW TYPE OF GAMEPLAY\n\nYour body is now a video game controller! Active Arcade uses advanced full-body motion tracking powered by AI, combined with gamification and augmented reality (AR) to make the experience fun for everyone. The camera will digitize your movement and power the gameplay in real-time. \n\nSIMPLE SETUP, PLAY ANYWHERE\n\nActive Arcade requires no special setup, wearables, or extra equipment. Just lean your iPhone or iPad against a stationary object like a chair, water bottle, or wall, and ensure the front-facing camera can see your full body.  For an even more immersive living room experience, connect your device to a TV through AirPlay or HDMI connection.\n\nSOMETHING FOR EVERYONE\n\nActive Arcade is simple and accessible so that people of all ages and every ability level can engage. The games are easy to play and don't require advanced athletic skills. There are more casual games like Reaction that focus on hand-eye coordination, and more full-body games like Box Attack that use your athleticism. A wide variety of games are available for every player, with new games added regularly.\n\nFUN WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY\n\nLike real sports activities, Active Arcade games are about playing and moving with friends and family members. But unlike many connected fitness solutions, Active Arcade makes engaging with friends and family a quick and simple activity that can happen anytime, anyplace. 2-Player game modes get you and your friends playing side-by-side.\n\nCAPTURE AND SHARE YOUR BEST MOVES\n\nLike a built-in photo booth, you’ll get instant highlights from your time in Active Arcade that shows off your best moves and are fun to post on social media—complete with all the interactive elements included. Post your highlights on social media and challenge your friends to get active too!\n\nENTIRELY FREE TO PLAY\n\nActive Arcade is free to play and contains no advertising, in-app purchases, or subscription model. It's an entirely free resource for the community and for everyone anywhere to play and engage. Share it with all your friends, family members, or anyone.\n\nGot any questions or feedback?\nPlease shoot us an email at ios-support@activearcade.ai. We'd love to hear from you."

      "label": "Unlock the power of intermittent fasting to reach your goal weight and get healthy. No diet and no yo-yo effect. Improve your metabolic health  and feel full of energy.\n\nWhat is intermittent fasting?\nIntermittent fasting is one of the most popular health and fitness trends. Instead of a diet, it's an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating. It doesn't specify which foods you should eat or avoid, but when you should eat.\nToday, we eat 3–4 (or more) meals per day, and never feel hungry. This requires our organs to work hard all the time, and never take a break from digesting. Our eating habits may result in obesity and health problems, such as diabetes.\nWhen fasting, your body will detoxify, burn fat and regenerate. After a few weeks, you'll feel healthier and more active. \n\nGradual fasting plans, suitable for all! \nCreate your own fasting plan 13-11, 15-9, 16-10, 16-8, 18-6, 20-4, 23-1, 24, 36, 48, Custom\n5+2 Weekly Plan : During the week, eat normally for 5 days, and choose another 2 days for a little control.Women take 500Kcal and men take 600Kcal on fasting days. You can choose to take it all at once, but a better choice is to divide 600Kcal into two meals, 250Kcal for breakfast and 350Kcal for dinner. The food should preferably be some food with high protein content but low glycemic index (GI). It is not recommended to completely eliminate carbohydrates. When eating, chew slowly and savor well. The fasting days need to be separated, such as Monday and Thursday. This light fasting plan is healthy, effective and easy to implement, allowing you to lose weight easily while enjoying the other benefits of fasting. It can be performed long-term, gradually turning it into a healthy lifestyle.\n16-8 is the most popular fasting plan for weight loss. With 16 hours fasting period, your body will gradually get used to fasting. \n \nBody Status Tracker : \nBlood Sugar Rises \nBlood Sugar Falls \nGlycogen Reserve Drops \nKetosis State \n\nMore Features :  \n- Track your weight changes \n- BMI(kg/m²) \n- Water tracker \n- Drink water reminder \n- On 'Record' Page, you can click 'Start' in the 'Daily Steps' card to read step count data from Apple Health\n\nPrivacy Policy : https://wowfitness.github.io/Privacy-Policy/ \nTerms of Use : https://wowfitness.github.io/Terms-of-Use/"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "The OFFICIAL ABRSM Aural Trainer contains interactive challenges to help develop your music aural skills (listening skills). Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 1 to 5. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher.\n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n\n• Improve your sense of pulse and metre (feeling the beat).\n\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it or spot differences and mistakes).\n\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n\n• Learn to describe dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Pulse and Metre\n• Echoes\n• Differences\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nTackle each element in stages using the preparation exercises.\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again. The app also features supporting tools including an interval trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

With this app you will not only train your brain by solving math problems, you will also learn special mental math tricks.\n\nFor many math problems, special tricks exist that make solving these much easier. It is important to know when to use which trick, but also how to solve a math problem if none of these special tricks can be used.\n\nThis app contains 44 lessons (with up to 3 tricks per lesson) where you will learn tips and tricks for the following types of math problems:\n-Addition\n-Subtraction\n-Multiplication\n-Division\n-Divisibility\n-Remainders\n-Squaring\n-Square and cube roots\n-Calculate the weekday for any date\n\nYou will not only learn the special tricks, but also more general solutions.\n\nIn the second part of this app, the training, you can solve random math problems with increasing difficulty (adaptive training). Or you can select what type of math problem you want to practice, and in which range the numbers should be (training with choice). The goal here is not only to become better and faster at solving math problems, you will also learn to detect which trick would be the best for the current math problem. This is why there is a help button in the training-section. If you push this button, the application will search for the trick or tip that is possibly the easiest for solving the current math problem.\n\nAdditional features:\n-Two languages: All texts are in english and german.\n-Two different GUI-designs: Use a blue background with white text in sci-fi movie style.

Fun for kids and adults alike and plenty of challenges at all levels.\n\n*Dinosaur Chess  by Mls968\nThis is a great program. The lessons are interesting, and play levels go from easy to difficult. My 4 and 6 year olds are learning the game, and it's helping novice players like my wife and I too. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to introduce their children to chess!\n\n*An excellent app   by Adg6\nA wonderful app. Ideal for anyone new to chess. It is even fun for experienced chess players.\n\n*Highly Recommended - by doled \n\"This is a fantastic chess teaching game. This game alone makes it worth buying an iPad. My three year old now knows the piece names and basic moves. My six year old is well on her way to playing a full game. Our family has had an iPad since the day the iPad was released and this is one of the best apps we have.\"\n\n*Great! - by TonySchleizer\n\"This game has gotten my 5 year old interested in chess. Great tutorials that get progressively harder as skills improve.\"\n\n\n* Great for getting started - by Milfordthelargebonedgorilla\n\"This has been fantastic for my five year old son...using this in addition to a real board and pieces has helped him immensely in understanding each of the pieces, how they move, their strengths and weaknesses...a terrific way to introduce young ones to the game without overwhelming them\"\n\n\n* Great learning tool - by Triplescoop \n\"I have an adopted 7 year old boy with fetal alcohol syndrome. It is very hard for him to learn to play games. Checkers was very hard for him to learn. I thought that chess would be something that he would have to wait to learn. I bought this app even though there were no reviews. So glad I did! What a great teaching tool! I love the mini games that teach the directions that each piece can move. We play slowly but my son can play chess! I recommend this for anyone who wants to learn the basics of the game. This app is for beginners. Great for kids! Thank you to the developers of this app!\"\n\n\n*Super! - by Chess player\n\"Hats off to the developers. A fun program for kids.\"\n\n\n*Ideal For kids - by Kingkot \n\"This game is ideal to teach the kids in the chess.\""

      "label": "倉頡輸入法(Cangjie Input)是一種常用的中文輸入法,由有「中文電腦之父」稱譽的台灣人朱邦復先生於1976年創製。初期只有正體中文版本,原名「形意檢字法」,用以解決電腦處理漢字的問題,包括漢字輸入、字形輸出、內碼儲存、漢字排序等。朱邦復發明此輸入法時正值他為三軍大學發展中文通訊系統之際,時任三軍大學校長的蔣緯國將軍為紀念上古時期倉頡造字之精神,乃於1978年將此輸入法重新定名為「倉頡輸入法」。\n1982年,朱邦復登報公開放棄倉頡輸入法專利權,並且極力推動電腦之中文化。現今大部分作業系統,甚至一些電子辭典皆附有倉頡輸入法,為正體中文世界最普及的形碼輸入法。\n\n倉頡輸入法適用於多種平臺,主流作業系統和大部分電子辭典均有內嵌。一些線上漢字字典也採用倉頡編碼作為檢索工具。\n\n本程式為一眾學倉頡的用家而設計,使用者只需輸入你要查詢的字,就能自動列出該字的倉頡碼及速成碼。\n\n感謝大家使用倉頡字典(Cangjie Input dictionary)及速成字典(Quick Input dictionary)，這兩本輸入法字典。"

Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 6 to 8. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher. \n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it).\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n• Improve your recognition of cadences, chords and modulations. \n• Learn to describe texture, structure, dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Cadences\n• Chords\n• Modulations\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again . The app also features supporting tools including a cadence trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing?

I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

Math Robot was designed for use by blind, visually impaired, and sighted students alike, making it ideal for use by an entire class.\n\nMath Robot provides fun drills and practices for simple math problems. The app is both self-voicing and accessible with VoiceOver. Math Robot announces each problem as it comes up.\n\nTeachers, parents, and students can set the range of numbers, the mathematical operations, the number of tries, and more.\n\nA low vision mode adds extra contrast.\n\nWhen using a refreshable braille display, like APH’s Refreshabraille 18™ Bluetooth device, VoiceOver shows the problem in braille and allows the user to enter their answers using the display’s braille keyboard.\n\nFeatures:\n► Compelling interface, animations, and sounds\n► Free and drill modes\n► Low vision mode\n► Retina graphics\n► Hardware keyboard support\n► VoiceOver support\n► Braille support\n\n\nFollow us on Twitter for updates: http://twitter.com/APHfortheBlind"

      "label": "Video Physics brings automated object tracking and video analysis to iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. Capture video of an object in motion, then tap to track automatically. Video Physics instantly creates trajectory, position, and velocity graphs for the object.\n\nVideo Physics is perfect for science students and instructors. Perform on-the-go analysis of interesting motion. Measure the velocity of a child's swing, a roller-coaster, or a car. Or, take a video of a basketball free throw shot. Video Physics will display the path of the ball and provide graphs of y vs. x as well as the x and y position and velocity as a function of time. \n\nFeatures of Video Physics: \n• Capture a new video using the built-in camera, choose a video from your Photo Library, or use one of our sample videos\n• Track an object automatically or manually add points to the video frame\n• Set the scale of the video using an object of known size\n• Optionally set coordinate system location and rotation\n• View graphs of trajectory and x/y position and velocity\n• Export video with points\n• Email the video and data for further analysis in Vernier's Logger Pro software for OS X and Windows\n• Open data files directly in Vernier's Graphical Analysis app\n\nQuotes from physics teachers: \n\"Just played with new Vernier video physics app on iPhone - it ROCKS! I remember the day when this would've cost thousands of dollars to do.\" Mark Hines @mhines, teacher \n\n\"You should check out Vernier's Video Physics app. Students can email video analysis data to Logger Pro; very cool!!\" @willkomme, physics teacher \n\nVernier’s Video Physics app is slick. - Ryan Bretag @ryanbretag, teacher and administrator \n\nApp Store featured: Staff Favorite, New and Noteworthy, and What's Hot!\n2012 CODiE Awards Finalist - Best Educational Use of a Mobile Device\n\nHints for taking useful videos: \n• Objects that are very different than their background (black/white) work best for automated tracking. It is also helpful to use a background with uniform color and shading. See our sample videos for examples.\n• Do not move the camera. Analysis assumes the camera is fixed in position. \n• The object in motion should remain approximately in a plane perpendicular to the viewing direction. \n• Place an object with known dimensions, such as a meter stick, in the same plane as the motion. Use this to scale the video. \n\nVideo Physics is intended for use in science education. The video analysis done in Video Physics provides a useful technique for studying two-dimensional kinematics. You can do even more with Vernier's Graphical Analysis app for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch or with Logger Pro software for Mac OS X and Windows."

      "label": "Get Rid of your Accent is a phenomenon. Seven years ago, we created an instant hit, the best-selling pronunciation book in the UK. Our second and third books make us the most popular books and CD package around. Actors, lawyers, brokers, businessmen, and diplomats have flourished with our help. \n\n\"As a diplomat I need effective communication skills, particularly to address public audiences through radio and TV. A clear, crisp accent is always more convincing than a thick, foreign one. I am reading this book and I think it is immensely useful for foreigners like myself.\"  Samuel Moncada, Venezuelan Ambassador to the UK\n\n\n\"Clearly, the authors of the book have collected years of experience and expertise to create this practical and effective tool for speech study.\"  Joe Windley, Head of Speech, Central School of Speech and Drama, London\n\nNow with this toolkit you can get the best of our amazing lessons in one easy-to-use app that goes everywhere with you, it is  the British English Pronunciation Course at your fingertips. Hear the sounds; see how to make them; practice; and watch your career, education, and social life blossom.\nVisit www.batcsglobal.com  \n\nApp Contents and Functionality\n\nThe lessons cover all English sounds needed to master Received Pronunciation, neutral accent of educated southern English and the chief accent taught to foreigners who wish to learn the British model. Students can play audio tracks, record themselves, and compare their pronunciation with the model.\n\nThis app will help you to:\n\n• Neutralise your accent within 1-3 months\n• Make your English clear and easy to understand\n• Become a better communicator and public speaker\n• Increase your personal confidence and overall image\n• Improve your job prospects\n\n\nAbout the authors\n\nLinda James (RAM, Dip. Ed., IPD, LRAM)\n\nLinda trained at the Royal Academy of Music and qualified as a teacher of Speech and Drama. She also holds an International Phonetics Diploma from London University.\n\nLinda has had extensive experience as a dialect coach in TV, films and the theatre. For more than 20 years she has worked as a Speech Tutor at several London drama colleges and privately, specialising in the teaching of Received Pronunciation (RP) and the eradication of accents.\n\n\nOlga Smith (BA in Linguistics, MBA)\n\nOlga holds a degree in Linguistics and an MBA from Nottingham University. She is also an advanced public speaker and a holder of the Toastmaster bronze reward.\n\nOlga learned a unique drama school method for Accent Reduction from top British phonetician Linda James. They together co-authored the UK bestselling books, “Get Rid of your Accent”, Part One, Part Two and Part Three.\n\nIn the past, you could only get speech training in British drama schools or by taking speech lessons from a private speech tutor. Olga wanted to make this exclusive training accessible for a much wider audience. Linda and Olga took the method long used in London drama schools, adapted it for learners of English and collated it into a single training manual, with CDs, the first of its kind.\n\nThe success of the book led to another venture Olga undertook: she designed and launched Accent Reduction courses for diplomats, professionals, students, and many others who need to neutralize their accent in a short period of time. The courses became a huge success and have been featured in National newspapers and television in the UK. Visit www.batcs.co.uk and book an individual course to get the best results in a short period of time."

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

      "label": "* Finalist for the BestAppEver Award: Toddler Apps *\n \nThe best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.\n\nNow with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.\n\nFirst Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:\n\n** Animals **\n** Vehicles **\n** Colors **\n** Shapes **\n** Words from around the house **\n\n(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles. \n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE Math BINGO:\n- Does not contain third-party ads. \n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks. \n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools. \n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store. \n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit: http://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n ---------------------------"

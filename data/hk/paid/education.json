      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Or sit back and study in slideshow mode ! Either way, you'll be acing those vocab tests in no time.\n\n\n\nBEFORE YOU BUY - consider whether you need flashcards beyond your first year of Greek. If so, then we recommend purchasing FlashGreek Pro, as it it contains ALL words in the Greek New Testament AND is keyed to Mounce's intro grammar. FlashGreek Pro allows you also to study by frequency or root, and to drill yourself on Principal Parts too.\n\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer 1* I am in no way associated with the publisher nor the author of the grammar. This is not an official companion app - it is simply compatible with the text.\n**Disclaimer 2** I have tried my darndest to be entirely accurate with the vocabulary lists according to chapters in the textbook. But mistakes do happen— my apologies if there are any. Please be responsible and check these flashcards against your textbook to ensure accuracy. If there are errors, please let us know and they will be fixed.\n***Disclaimer 3*** The meanings in these flashcards derive from the awesome ©Accordance Bible Software, and sometimes particular authors view some words slightly differently. In most cases the differences are minor and inconsequential - but again, be responsible and check them against your textbook."

Conduct cognitive science experiments. \n\n_ Bionic Visual Programming  (BVP)\nInspired by the neurological structure of the human brain, NEURO is designed specifically for creating AI-based programs. It features many neuro-inspired modules like Sense, Fear, Knowledge, Imagination, Reward, etc. Plus programming in NEURO is entirely codeless.\n\n_ ML Packages\nWith more than 100 Machine Learning packages and modular presets to choose from, you can easily create AI-based programs from simple object recognition to a reward-driven self-aware system.\n\n_ Sensors and Behaviors\nThe six sensors resemble the human sensory system - sight, sound, touch, motion, body, and info. The behaviors include a wide way of output such as light, vibration, sound, images, and even smart home controls.\n\n_ Virtual Nuclei \nNuclei are units for building circuitry based on the reductionist mechanism of neurological pathways, like the reward loop, motivations, fight or flight system, and even emotions. Use them to create a conscious system, enhance your program, or conduct cognitive experimentations. \n\n_ Nervous System\nHold and drag to synapse a nerve fiber between two modules. There are a handful of neural nodes that can alter neural signals on the way. \n\n_ Cyberclean UI\nNEURO focuses on data and logic, yet still outputs a solid and futuristic UI that maximizes interactivity. Tap on any of the modules to zoom in for configurations. Tap on the top bar to reveal their support documents. \n\n_ Biomark and Biocode\nYour program can be compressed into a single scannable Biocode for instant sharing. You can. also permanently sign your work with Biomark, which can not be altered even after sharing.\n\nMore features:\n_6 templates included\n_Plastic nerve, Hyponerve, Hypernerve\n_Firing rate control for optimization\n_Envelope and Nap\n_UI modeling with Projector\n_Rename your program\n_Biomark and Biocode\n_Autosave\n\n* Neural Engine and ML functions may not support on all devices and all OS versions:\n  recommend iOS 14.0 or later, iPhone 7 or later, all Apple supported iPad models, Apple Watch Series 2 or later"

I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

Some activities help children learn their times tables, others give practice with the tables that they have learnt. \n\nSet the multiplication tables to use in the games. Setting a single table is useful for learning it. Setting a number of tables gives more general practice. \n\nAll activities have three levels of difficulty. The lowest level of each activity always lets children explore at their own pace. Each level comes with instructions and suggestions for adults to help kids make the most of the activities. \n\nChildren can win 40 reward items by playing the games. The items are added to a picture where kids can use them to make whatever scenes they like. Some special rewards cause things to happen! \n\nPlayers log in as a Numberjacks agent. There are three separate agents, so up to 3 children can keep their own settings, scores and rewards."

      "label": "Do you teach beginning readers and spellers? You’re sure to LOVE our beginning spelling app for word study called Alphabetic Spellers! It’s FULL of word study activities for letter sounds and short vowel words. It’s PERFECT for advanced preschoolers or Kindergartners or any child in the Alphabetic Spelling Stage.\n\nSo what makes this one different?\n\n* It covers all of the phonics skills that beginning readers and spellers need including beginning sounds, ending sounds, middle short vowel sounds,word families, CVC words, and longer short vowel words.\n\n* It’s designed for more than one user.\n\n* It tracks what your learners do.\n\n* You can customize sorts specifically for each learner. While we have TONS of pre-made sorts in the app, you can customize the phonics categories, which makes differentiation a breeze!\n\nOne of the cool things about this app is that YOU get to assign the phonics skills your learners interacts with in the app!\n\nYou can choose between beginning sounds (pictures), ending sounds (pictures), short vowel sounds (pictures), beginning blends (pictures), beginning digraphs (pictures), word families, CVC words, longer short vowel words, and the exciting My Sorts, where learners interact with the custom sorts you’ve built for them!\n\nACTIVITIES PAGE\n\nFor each sort, the learner sorts the items, does a timed sort, does a blind sort, and types the words or parts of words.\n\n1- SORTING – There are sorts for pictures, like this beginning blend sort and sorts for words. With these sorts, the app will not allow the learner to put the picture/word in the wrong column. This works well when you can’t be right there to offer immediate feedback yourself. Learners are able to sort and re-sort, like you do with a paper sort.\n\n2- TIMED SORTS – There are timed sorts for all the sorts. In this activity, the learner taps GO and sorts the items as fast as she can. The timed sort allows for incorrect answers at first.  Once all the items have been sorted, it pulls out the incorrect answers and asks the learner to sort them again. When all items have been sorted correctly, the timer stops.\n\nThe learner then does the timed sort once more, trying to beat her own time. After the second time, the learner has the option to try again or continue to a different activity.\n\n3- BLIND SORT – In the blind sorts, the word (or picture for picture sorts) is called out and the learner has to tap the column where the word belongs. If she is correct, she hears a ding sound. If the learner taps the wrong column, the word is put back into the “deck” to try again.\n\n4- WRITTEN SORTS – The paper word study resource allows for paper/pencil written sorts. On the app, learners type words (or parts of words) as a spelling test. The data from this test can be emailed to you. If you go into the “Adult” section of the app, you can also see exactly what the learner spelled correctly or incorrectly. This is such great information to help inform your spelling instruction!\n\n5- BONUS – Write it Anytime! – On the menu screen for the user, all four activities are listed. You get to choose which ones you want your learner to do, but I recommend all of them! We’ve also included a “Practice Writing Anytime” feature at the bottom of the screen. With one tap, the learner can practice spelling the words from the word sort.\n\nThe app has TONS of pre-made sorts for pictures and words. But let’s say that your learner needs something that’s not offered. You can design your own sorts!!\n\nWhen you enter the “Adult” section, not only can you create/edit users and assign sorts, but you can build your own sorts, too!\n\nYou can choose what kind of sort (picture or word sorts), how many columns you want to include, and if you want oddball words or not. If you want to use these same words in my printable pack, they can be typed into the editable fields.\n\nOnce you’ve built the sort, you can assign it to users. All the same activities (seen in numbers 1-5 above) can be done with the custom sorts."

      "label": "We've been making educational software for twenty years, and this is by far the best educational app we have ever made. We wish every child could use it before they start school.\n\nWhy are Phonic Flashcards better than regular flashcards?  Because when you learn with Phonic Flashcards, the phonemes (letters and digraphs) are sounded out! The word \"fish\" becomes \"fff\" \"i\" \"shhh\", with all words and phonemes recorded by a professional voice artist, helping to build a solid phonics foundation for reading (and spelling) success!\n\nAll our apps are designed to maximize learning outcomes, while also being super easy to use. Parents do not need a degree in order to use Phonic Flashcards to teach their child how to read.\n\nPhonic Flashcards makes a great classroom activity for literacy centers, as well as for one-on-one teaching and assessment, and also whole-class instruction when teaching short vowel sounds.\n\n\nAges 4-7 plus remedial\n\nIncludes 200+ flashcards, mainly common nouns.\n\nEach interactive card features a picture, which you can tap to hear a fun sound effect.\nChoose whether to have the words voiced, sounded-out, or both!\nTap the letters and digraphs to hear each phoneme. Blend them together to sound-out the word.\nHide the picture to administer a reading test.\n\nBegin with the sounds of the alphabet.\nNext learn to read CVC words, focusing on each short vowel sound.\nThen progress on to 4-5 letter words with blends and common digraphs.\nChoose a phoneme/sound from the \"Digraphs Menu\" which includes: ck, sh, ch, th, ng, oo, ee, oa, ou, ai, ea, oi, oy, ow, aw, ir, ar, or, and ur.\nFull details of all of the Word Lists can be found at: www.phonicflashcards.com\n\nAs well as FLASHCARDS, there are three additional activities:\nSHADOWS - a multisensory word-building game which is visual and tactile, while also reinforcing phonemes.\nMATCH UP! - simply involves matching words with pictures. Turn off the sound cues to test word recognition.\nWHICH WORD? - a game-show style phonological awareness quiz, to test students on initial sounds and rimes.\n\nUpon completing each activity, children are rewarded with a simple tap-tap style arcade game of their choice, Frog Hop or Fish Food.\n\n\nPlease refer to the PDF Guide (found at www.phonicflashcards.com) for full details of all the activities, and \"How to teach your child to read using Phonic Flashcards\".\n\n\nThe Phonic Flashcards app requires no setting up, apart from choosing your voice accent the very first time you use it.\nThere are USA, UK and Australian speech options. \n(You may change voice accent at any time in ‘Settings’ via the cog icon on the front screen.)\n \n\nWe care about your child's privacy.\nThis app contains: no ads, no in-app purchases, no sharing of data, no tracking of your location, and no links to social media.\n \n \nIf you like our apps, please support us by reviewing and/or rating them in the app store! If you have any suggestions to make our apps better, please contact us directly via our website (www.phonicflashcards.com)"

It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

      "label": "* Finalist for the BestAppEver Award: Toddler Apps *\n \nThe best-selling reading game for kids has gotten even better! We've added more words, more languages, and phonics. First Words Deluxe provides endless fun for the toddlers in your life, all while giving your child a head start on learning their letters and learning to spell words.\n\nNow with Spanish, French, German, Japanese, plus US and UK English.\n\nFirst Words Deluxe is toddler-tested and approved, with a user-interface designed specifically for the littlest of fingers.  The game includes over 150 words in five kid-friendly categories:\n\n** Animals **\n** Vehicles **\n** Colors **\n** Shapes **\n** Words from around the house **\n\n(Fewer words are shown when the phonics option is selected, because many English words are not spelled phonetically.  A total of 68 phonics words are included.)\n\nA wide range of options let you tune the game to match your child's current skills and abilities.\n\nIf your child is old enough to ask for your phone, they're old enough for First Words Deluxe!\n\nHere's what educators and reviewers have said about our First Words apps: \n\n“First Words is an app that teaches letters and words in fun and interactive way. Very easy to use these apps will help support your little ones learning with great illustrations and bright colors. Each app supports kids learning and encourages kids to explore and discover by revealing, rewarding and teaching.” \n-- Fun Educational Apps \n\n“Excellent - As a teacher, I love this game! Just what technology was meant to do!” \n-- iTunes Review \n\n“This app has great settings that let you control the level of difficulty for the child – either with lots of hints or almost none at all. The letters slide nicely into each word and when completed the child is rewarded by having the pictured animal enlarge and animate briefly.” \n--Carisa Kluver at Digital Stortyime \n\n“First Words Deluxe is a very straightforward word-building game. Words are either said letter by letter as they are dragged into the appropriate gray boxes or, if chosen in the settings, a smaller set of words can be sounded out with phonics. This makes this game a treat for both pre-readers and early spellers.” \n--Common Sense Media \n\n“Looking to guide your toddler towards recognizing letters and how to spell words up to eight letters long? Then First Words Deluxe might be just what you are looking for. This pre-reader and spelling application encourages vocabulary development in a wide range of categories such as: vehicles, animals, at home, colors, and shapes.” \n--Andrea Gardner at Applicable2u \n\n\"First Words is a great app -- as I said at the time, 'Leo loves First Words because it's fun and easy. I love it because he's learning to spell words, and the interface makes that learning error-free.'\" \n---Shannon Des Roches Rosa at Squidalicious \n\n*** We love getting feedback from our users.

Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again. The app also features supporting tools including an interval trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 6 to 8. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher. \n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it).\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n• Improve your recognition of cadences, chords and modulations. \n• Learn to describe texture, structure, dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Cadences\n• Chords\n• Modulations\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again . The app also features supporting tools including a cadence trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

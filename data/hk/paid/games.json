      "label": "這是我們開發的一款單機向SLG，\r\n借鑒和學習了《三國志》、《霸王的大陸》系列，\r\n內容豐富耐玩，上手後極易沉迷，\r\n遊戲沒有大額付費，就算不付費也可以愉快的玩幾十個小時。\r\n但由於難度較高，強烈不建議新手上來就挑戰困難難度。\r\n\r\n【遊戲特點】\r\n豐富的戰鬥陣形和技能，\r\n在戰斗場景中山河、湖泊、城關等不同地形上有變化多端的戰術組合，\r\n加上天氣系統對戰局的影響，使得戰場玩法極具特色。\r\n\r\n根據面對敵人的情況不同，\r\n不同戰術可以形成各自的打法流派，\r\n常見的如搶城速攻流、近戰突擊流，單挑控制流、遠射連珠流等等。\r\n\r\n數十萬字原創遊戲文本，全部源自製作團隊對相關史料的分析提煉，\r\n各種武將列傳、軼事；各地的背景介紹，皆有可靠的依據出處。\r\n玩家玩遊戲的同時能感受到那個時代的文化氣息、社會風貌，\r\n從更豐富的層面帶玩家領略濃厚的歷史人文精神。\r\n\r\n【玩家攻略社区】 \r\nFacebook:三國志天下布武 \r\nLine:sanguo15\r\n\r\n【為什麼選擇開發這款遊戲】\r\n我從小便沉迷於《霸王的大陸》和光榮的《三國志》，\r\n但市面上很難找到類似玩法的手機遊戲。\r\n於是我做了一個，只是沒想到，這個歷程是如此的艱難。\r\n\r\n我常常跟同是做這類產品的朋友浪子交流，他說《漢末霸業》一路走來，一樣殊為不易，在這個年代想要有自己的堅持，必須付出相當的代價。\r\n\r\n經常有朋友問我，“為什麼不去做別的更賺錢的遊戲？”\r\n的確，我們的這款遊戲不怎麼賺錢，\r\n不充值都可以玩的很開心，充個幾十能嗨皮幾個月。\r\n\r\n朋友的這個問題，是對我的靈魂拷問。\r\n因為我的年紀已經不小了，拖家帶口的，這個問題必須正視。\r\n但朋友說的“那種賺錢的遊戲”，我不喜歡。\r\n\r\n朋友不理解我對這種遊戲的感情。\r\n在那個網吧還只有局域網的年代，\r\n這個品類的遊戲伴著我度過了無數個日日夜夜。\r\n為了統一全國殫精竭慮，以至於茶飯不思、夙夜難眠。\r\n那時的我，是沉浸的，是幸福的。\r\n而現在，我有機會能利用我的專業技能把這種感受發揚光大。\r\n把我自己對這種遊戲的理解傾注到產品之中，\r\n置於更大的平台之上，\r\n讓更多跟我同樣喜歡這類游戲的玩家體會到這種快樂，\r\n這是一種使命，一種榮譽。\r\n\r\n能做這個遊戲，是我人生中最幸福的事情。\r\n我還有很多關於它的想法，已經在心頭縈繞多年，\r\n我想要呈現的，還遠不止之前大家曾看到的。\r\n如果能賺錢，我會把這個遊戲一直做下去。\r\n如果賺不到，我就先去做點別的，用賺來的錢把這個遊戲繼續做下去。\r\n\r\n逝水東流，青山依舊，是非成敗，任人評說。\r\n我素未謀面的朋友們，祝你們玩得開心。\r\n\r\n——遊戲製作人：奶牛"

Players control members of the Night Chasers, a group of heroic warriors, as they embark on an adventure to save their lands from an evil threat.\n\n[Game Features]\n◆ Thrilling match-3 battle experiences\nMatch three Emblems to clear them from the board and make your heroes attack. Clear four or more to generate Magic Emblems, allowing your heroes to unleash powerful skills. Perform combos to launch even more powerful attacks and vanquish your enemies!\n\n◆ Traditional Japanese-style RPG experience\nIn a world of magic and swordplay, players will control members of the Night Chasers as they embark on an adventure together. Enter deep caves, explore ancient ruins, unlock treasure chests, fight against ferocious monsters, upgrade your equipment in town, and gain new information from villagers in the local taverns. A exciting RPG experience is waiting for you in Hero Emblems II!\n\n◆ Substitute Heroes\nEach Hero possesses their own unique skills and backstory. There's Zack, the Human Warrior; Lucien, the Marten Knight; Sid, the Felinian Black Mage; Abner the Bard, and many more! Lead your favorite heroes into battle!\n\n◆ Thrilling Japanese character voices in battles\nPersonalized character voices make combat a thrilling, intense and fun experience!\n\n◆ More equipment\nEnemies attack with a wide range of debuffs such as Poison, Ignition, Petrification or Curses. To fight against these tough opponents, you will need to choose your Heroes'  weapons and armor carefully, and make good use of accessories to resist enemy debuffs and boost your Heroes' abilities!\n\n◆One-time payment, IAP-free, and ad-free\n\n\nA New Chapter in the Night Chasers' History\nA long time ago, there was a mercenary group known as the Night Chasers. Instead of making money, these heroic warriors went around helping those in need. During the war, they helped a great many people who were suffering under tyranny and injustice. However, in the ensuing age of peace, the Night Chasers were no longer needed, and were forced to disband. Years later, four young people - Zack, Lucien, Sid, and Odelia - decided to carry on their legacy, forming the new Night Chasers.\n\nOne day, Zack and his party save an Elven girl named Dolores. Suffering from amnesia, Dolores cannot remember why she has ventured so far from the Elven Kingdom – only that she has been sent on an urgent quest. Concerned for her well-being, the Night Chasers take her into their fold, leading them to discover an ancient and terrible threat to the kingdom...\n\n** Recommend to use iPhone 6/iPad min4/iPad Air2/iPad 5th Gen./iPad Pro or later devices for better experiences.**"

      "label": "Thank you for visiting the page of \"The Heroic Legend of Eagarlnia\", it's a premium game with no in-app-purchase which you can play offline!\n\nThis is a light-weight \"grand strategy\" game with a unique original story background made by an indie team of 5. Although the gameplay is not exactly innovative, it represents our game producer's passion and understanding of the classic strategic games. With Eagarlnia, we hope to bring you an enjoyable single-player strategy game experience that you don't have to rush to make the better decision, but would be able to play wherever and whenever you are. \n\nThe game first launched an early access PC version last October. After nearly a year of tuning, we finally achieved a 30-day rating of 90%+ positive feedback, and finally we felt comfortable to bring Eagarlnia to you on mobile consoles. \n\nYou will enter a world of Swords & Magic, where there are countries with different characteristics and potential relationships, and you can choose to become the monarch of any country. Through wise management of your own territory, you will grow your economic and military strengths, and eventually conquer other countries and become the overlord of Eagarlnia.\n\nIn addition to the rich and colorful heroic paintings and pixel-style fighting scenes,  you will experience these 3 key features: \n\n1. A story-rich fantasy world with 5 living races  \nEvery existence in the world of Eagarlnia has its own story where rivals could have been sworn brothers. You will gradually discover unknown relationships between the heroes, and along the way you will establish your own exclusive network, eventually conquering them all. \n\n2. A customized gaming experience with more than 350+ heroes\nFrom the very beginning of the game, you will be able to customize the original settings of your country, the management of your wealth, the configuration of the AIs, etc. \nThere are more than 350 heroes in the game, where you can have them join your force through visiting, lobbying and capturing. Some of them are incomparable in intelligence, some are brave, some are insidious and cunning, and some are despicable. Use them wisely to become a qualified ruler. Some special heroes even have their own special artifacts, which need to be unlocked by completing specific missions.\n\n3. A game for creating your own epic story \nYou can choose from 19 forces of different advantages and skills. You can grow your force through internal affairs management, development on wealth and strength, manipulating others through diplomatic tactics, acquiring talents from battlefield, dungeon adventure and many other ways awaiting your discovery. The game is also designed to have more than a hundred kinds of troops, of which reasonable matching and deployment is key to your vicotry. In addition, there are also hidden troops with powerful abilities packed with the mysterious powers for you to unlock.\n\nFinally, we are eager to know your feedback on the game through email to thloe@pixmain.com or chat with us on Discord.\n\nIf you like the game, it's much appreciated that you would leave us a good review and rating, which would really help and support our development team in future updates and optimization! Thank you!"

      "label": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.

Includes all updates and a new campaign, as well as full cross-platform saves compatibility and an all-new interface designed specifically for touch based platforms.\n \n***RockPaperShotgun’s Bestest Best Tactics game***\n \n**“Door Kickers is a game about cops kicking down doors, and these doors are a lot of fun to kick down. It is also very hard, and I love it for that.” ***\n84/100 – PC Gamer\n \n***”It evokes lot of the more demanding thrills that modern games have left behind, the grit and the hard won satisfaction of overcoming intimidating challenges, or the experimental fun of spending hours tinkering with all the different ways you can play through a big, open-ended level. I had a blast inching my way through pretty much all of the harder stages in this game and I also think you might have a blast with it too.” ***\nSuper Bunnyhop\n \n“It’s a thing of beauty and manages to capture the planning and satisfying execution of more complex strategy games, as well as the gung-ho and the popping-off of growly man in military shooters. (...) It’s probably the best man-shootery game I’ve played in years.”\nIndie Statik\n \nDoor Kickers mixes old school, no-quarter action with modern ergonomic interfaces and puts you in command of a SWAT team during a tactical intervention.\n \nAnalyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.\n \nIt may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps and losing no people, that’s a skill harder to master.\nQuick Points:\n§ 80 single missions, 6 campaigns and unlimited gameplay via mission generator\n§ Over 65 weapons and gear items to use and overcome the enemy.\n§ Top Down perspective  for optimal tactical analysis\n§ Real Time With Free Pause\n§ No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces\n§ Realistic but action packed\n§ Non-linear levels, freeform gameplay\n\nWebsite https://inthekillhouse.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/KillHouseGames\nTwitter - @inthekillhouse"

Everyone has a story to tell and a mystery to unravel–are you up to the challenge?\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen it was finally demolished in 1993, Hong Kong’s Kowloon Walled City was the most densely populated place on the planet. Fifty thousand people lived and worked in an area the size of an average city block. A patchwork network of transportation systems, crude but efficient, connected the City’s labyrinthine passageways and buildings.\r\n\r\nThe Walled City gained infamy as a lawless, densely populated ghetto, a jungle of dilapidated concrete and grimy neon signs echoing with the thunder of jet engines flying low overhead. Many historical accounts have focused on the darker side of life there: the gangs that ruled in lieu of police, the damp, sunless apartments whose inhabitants ate and slept alongside rats and cockroaches.\r\n\r\nYet life in Kowloon was not without virtue. Most of the City’s residents made an honest living–working as dentists, shopkeepers, mechanics, etc.–and were intimately connected with their communities. They recognized the deficiencies of the place they called home, and they fought tooth and nail to give their children a chance at a better life, but they were not ashamed to live in the Walled City.\r\n\r\nToday all that remains are the glimpses of that marvelous existence captured in old newspaper clippings, home videos, and photo albums. But the City still lives in the memories of its former residents–and in the imaginations of cyberpunk fans worldwide. Mr. Pumpkin 2: Walls of Kowloon brings these memories to light once more..."

In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.\n\nThe stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland.

      "label": "A story-driven experience about two doctors traversing backwards through a dying man's memories to artificially fulfill his last wish.\n\nABOUT THIS GAME\nDr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts have peculiar jobs: They give people another chance to live, all the way from the very beginning... but only in their patients' heads.\n\nDue to the severity of the operation, the new life becomes the last thing the patients remember before drawing their last breath. Thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives, but didn’t.\n\nThis particular story follows their attempt to fulfill the dream of an elderly man, Johnny. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny's past is revealed. As the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is.\n\nAnd Johnny's last wish is, of course... to go to the moon.\n\nMORE DETAILS\n\"To the Moon\", a story-driven RPG with pixel graphics, was originally developed six years ago for PC by Canadian producer Kan Gao and Freebird Games, his indie game studio.Rights to develop and publish the remastered mobile version of \"To the Moon\" were acquired by X.D.

With this we should consign the term “interactive movie” to history’s dustbin, because movies can’t dream of offering audiences a narrative structure as intimate and involving as this: they’re just moving pictures. Her Story points to the future\" 5/5, The Guardian\n\nHer Story is the critically acclaimed mystery game from Sam Barlow. Playing like an interactive true crime documentary, the game lets you go hands on with a police database full of live action video footage. It stars Viva Seifert, actress and one half of the band Joe Gideon and the Shark.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nHer Story sits you in front of a mothballed desktop computer and logs you into a police database. Search through hundreds of video clips that cover seven interviews from 1994 in which a British woman is interviewed about her missing husband. Explore the database by typing search terms, watch the clips where she speaks those words and piece together her story.\n\n\"Her Story is a beautiful amalgam of the cinema and video game formats... a remarkable achievement...\" 90, The Washington Post\n\n\"Profound, gripping live-action drama… sure to be discussed for years to come\" 5/5, Digital Spy\n\nUnlike anything you've played before, Her Story is an involving and moving experience. One that asks you to listen."

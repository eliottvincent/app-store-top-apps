Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Se utilizan hermosas ilustraciones y sonidos divertidos para crear interés en sus hijos.\r\n\r\nEsta aplicación contiene 3 módulos:\r\n\r\n(i) ABC: aprender el alfabeto \r\n\r\nEn este módulo, sus hijos entrarán en contacto con el abecedario y escucharán cómo deletrear. Mentalmente, ellos aprenderán el alfabeto al asociarlo con un animal cuyo nombre comience con determinada letra del alfabeto.\r\n\r\n(ii) Elige el animal \r\n\r\nEn este módulo, sus hijos aprenderán a relacionar cada letra con un animal. Se escucha un sonido de aplausos para animarlos cada vez que ellos hagan la combinación correcta.\r\n\r\n(iii) Deletrea el nombre \r\n\r\nEn este módulo, sus seres queridos aprenderán a escribir los nombres de los animales que están presentes en la aplicación. Primero, las letras saldrán en el orden correcto desde la cabeza del animal, luego, se barajarán las letras y sus hijos intentarán escribir el nombre del animal colocando las letras en el orden correcto en los cuadros de fondo. Este módulo está hecho para que sus hijos reciben la ayuda necesaria para memorizar cómo escribir correctamente los nombres de muchos animales."

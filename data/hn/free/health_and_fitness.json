Benefit from the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method, trusted by hundreds of millions adopters worldwide!\n\nPerfect for establishing a basic eating discipline, Simple is ideal for keeping yourself in good shape during self-isolation, with our educational and motivational content on staying mindful about your eating habits.\n\nPopularized by celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé, intermittent fasting is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans. It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "You don’t need any special medical equipment to get your pulse and to keep track of your health state, just your phone camera! Most accurate, fast and easy to use heart rate app.\n \nAPPLIED METHOD:\n\nOur app is based on photoplethysmography (PPG), non-invasive optical technique. Each heart beat transmits the amount of blood to the tissues in your fingers, while the blood absorbs your camera’s light, it illuminates the skin and captures microvascular blood volume changes such as ebb and flow. That allows you to measure the pulse easily, accurately and efficiently.\n \nHOW TO USE:\n\nCover the camera lens and flashlight with your fingertip completely. Do not press too intensively in order to avoid reducing blood flow. Hold your phone steady and keep still. Make sure your fingers are not cold. Press the button and get your results.\n \nTRACK YOUR MEASUREMENTS:\n\nGet visual display of the data at the given period of time. Personal dashboard with your measurement history.\n \nHEALTH KIT INTEGRATION:\n\nSupport for sharing heart rate results with Apple Health App.\n \nREMINDER:\n\nReceive notifications in order to have your finger on the pulse. Staying healthy and fit is a systematic process.\n \nIMPROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE:\nTrack your workout effectiveness to get in shape, improve your endurance and general wellness.\n \nNEVER MISS A BEAT!\n \nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n \nYearly subscription with 3-day free trial period will give you full access to \n* Unlimited measurements per day, \n* Monthly statistics,\n* Health insights, \n* No ads.\n \nDisclaimer: App measurements are just recommendations and can’t be used for diagnostics or medical purpose. Always seek a doctor's advice before making any medical decisions.\n\nPlease note that the app doesn't measure blood pressure, oxygen levels and body temperature, you can only record and keep measurement indexs! You need a thermometer, a tonometer and a pulse oximeter to measure values. Save your measurements in \"Heart Rate\".\n \nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\n \nSubscriptions may be managed by you and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to iTunes Account Settings. For more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period.

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

Take note of your menses in our app, and it will automatically remind you about the start of a new cycle several days before it happens.\n\nIf you're planning to get pregnant, this app tells you what days you are most likely to conceive.\nBesides monitoring your cycle, you can keep track of other important information. Add important events related to your sex life. Add notes to remember such things as symptoms and mood changes. You can use this app as your personal journal.\n\nMy Cycle is made specially for women like you.\nIf you have any questions or requests, please write to neumandev@gmail.com.

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps.

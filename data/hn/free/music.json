Use the JLab Sound App to increase or decrease the amount of outside noise you let in by adjusting your Be Aware settings. (For Be Aware Compatible earbuds only)\n \nEQ Customization\nFine tune your sound by adjusting the equalizer settings. JLab products come set with three default settings - called Custom EQ3 Sound, which features JLab Signature, Balanced and Bass Boost and a 4th option 'Custom'. Use the JLab Air ANC App to test and set your own equalizer settings by adjusting Bass (200, 280, 400 Hz levels), Mid-Range (550, 770, 1000, 2000 Hz levels) and Treble (4000, 8000, 16000 Hz levels). You can adjust each of the four presets, which includes a 'Custom' option with levels starting flat.\n \nCustom Controls\nJLab products come with controls in each earbud that control anything from volume, track changes, play/pause and more. If you'd like to switch the settings, you can customize your controls further via the app."

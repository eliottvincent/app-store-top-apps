We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.\n\nYou can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.\n\nIf you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details – all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments. \n\nFeedFinder is part of a project by Open Lab Newcastle University, UK.

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One!

Upgrading to Footpath Elite unlocks the following powerful features:\n\n\nTURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATION\n- Footpath will tell you when to turn with turn-by-turn audio cues on your iPhone and Apple Watch.\n- Save your route and cues in advance for voice guidance that works completely offline.\n- Double tap your AirPods or use the playback controls button on your headphones to replay your next cue. \n\nPREMIUM MAPS\n- 3D and topographic maps including Footpath Outdoors (Worldwide), USGS Topo Maps (U.S. and Canada), OpenCycleMap (Worldwide), and many more. \n- Cycling lanes, avalanche slope shading, and elevation contour lines.\n- Save places as favorites to customize your maps\n\nORGANIZE\n- Create and edit unlimited saved routes\n- Duplicate, merge, and split routes\n- Organize and sort routes into custom lists\n\nANALYZE\n- Calendar log and weekly summary of your activity\n- Analyze splits, speed, elevation, and heartrate\n- Speed heatmaps\n\nEXPORT\n- GPX import and export\n- TCX and FIT course export for turn-by-turn navigation on Garmin and Wahoo GPS devices\n- Export cue sheets to a spreadsheet app for customization and printing\n- Export routes and workouts to Apple Health\n\n\nYou can purchase a Footpath Elite monthly or yearly subscription through your iTunes account.

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the same cost as your original purchase.\n\n\nTIPS FOR MAPPING ROUTES\n• For longer routes, try zooming in and mapping your route in multiple segments.\n• Tap and hold the map to quickly route between waypoints and POIs.\n• Did Footpath snap to the wrong roads? Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

You can then tap to view street view, share or get directions (via Apple Maps or iMaps+).\n\nAlternatively, drag the yellow peg man from the top left hand corner of the map and release over a road or path to access street view.\n\nStreet view supports zooming in and out, and showing a mini-map overlay. There is also a full screen mode for a more immersive experience.\n\nIf you need a more complete Google Maps experience, look for \"iMaps+ for Google Maps\" on the App Store. iMaps+ provides all the great functionality from iStreets with the addition of directions, traffic, contacts integration and more.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nSubscriptions: iStreets operates as a subscription service. Recurring purchase is required for full functionality. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed, and auto-renewal may be turned off, from iStreets settings or the Apple Settings app. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited if you change your subscription term.\n\nDirections, street view and live traffic details are only available in certain geographical regions.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nTerms of Service: http://apptility.co.uk/imaps_tos.html\n\nApptility Limited is not related to, or affiliated with, Google, Inc.

Nice!\"\n\nA simple and uncluttered interface to read:\n• Altitude or Elevation\n• Latitude\n• Longitude\n\nFeatures\n• Highest GPS accuracy for your device\n• Ground elevation from topographical map values\n• View in feet or meters\n• Built-in flashlight\n\nSharing\n• Share screenshots with beautiful backgrounds\n• Share on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, or text message\n\nUse the Custom Background upgrade to take a photo from the top of a mountain and take a screenshot with your altitude overlaid to show your family & friends.\n\nBackgrounds (In-App purchases):\n• Meadow landscape (Illustrated)\n• Cityscape (Illustrated)\n• Mountains (Illustrated)\n• Abstract\n• Choose Your Own\n\nNote: Many customers with high altitude illnesses or sensitivities, such as chronic lung disease, asthma, COPD, & emphysema find this app useful for avoiding high altitudes. It is also used by hikers and climbers who want to avoid high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). However, the altitude shown is potentially subject to large inaccuracies and this app should NOT be used as a primary device for determining altitude for medical reasons."

We are able to display coordinates in four formats on one screen:\n-\tDMS (Degrees, minutes, seconds)\n-\tDDM Degrees and decimal minutes\n-\tDD Decimal degrees\n-\tUTM Universal Transverse Mercator\n\nAdditional data that is displayed is altitude and GPS accuracy. Altitude is measured using three sources:\n-\tGPS receiver\n-\tNetwork API\n-\tbuilt-in barometer sensor\nUsing the data, we are able to display your position on Maps.\n\nOne of the most useful features is being able to take a photo with GPS coordinates overlayed on it. If you don’t want to take a picture, you can save your location by adding it to your places. In saved locations, you can find saved photos as well as saved places. Data history is recorded chronologically.\n\nThe S.O.S functionality allows  you to quickly send your GPS coordinates and a Google Maps link by  Messages to provided phone number(s) in settings. We can additionally provide text content that will appear in a message.\n\n\nOn the main screen as well as the history screen, you can share your GPS coordinates with your buddies via your social media profile, messenger apps or email.\n\nIn settings you can manage things like:\n\n-\tGPS data refresh rate interval (the more often the more battery life)\n-\tat what distance the GPS data should be refreshed (the more often the more battery life)\n-\taltitude units\n-\taccuracy units\n-\tspeed units\n-\tif saved photos should also be saved in your phones gallery\n-\ttext position and color in photos\n\nNOTICE:\nThe application contains advertisements, if you don’t want to see the ads or GPS data from plugged in, more precise GPS receivers such as Garmin GLO2, you can buy a subscription. By plugging into external GPS services, accuracy of the  received measurements increases to 1 foot.\n\nNOTICE:\nThe accuracy of the application depends on the sensitivity of the GPS receiver built into the phone. In most cases, the GPS modules embedded in the phone provide an accuracy of + - 10 m. GPS sensitivity also depends on the place of measurement:\nInferior measurements often inside buildings, between buildings and in bad weather.\nBetter in the open air, under a clear sky.\n\nTerms and conditions:  https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/mygpslocation\r\nPrivacy policy:              https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/mygpslocation"

      "label": "Speed Limit App displays the current speed limit and your current speed. It detects European speed limit signs using the camera while driving and enhances the results by map based limits from OpenStreetMap. Thus it will even know limits which are not indicated by signs (i.e. Zone 30, or inner city areas). Of course it will warn you when you are too fast. \n\n► Working principle of Speed Limit App\nSpeed Limit App is a road sign recognition app. For inner city limits we use map based information from OpenStreetMap. Both information is merged to provide an optimal limit indication. The speedometer gets its data from the GPS and is used to determine wether you are above or below the actual limit of the last detected road sign.\n\n► Limitations of Speed Limit App\nSpeedometer Radar Camera does a computational intensive job that formerly was limited to mainframes. Therefore there are some restrictions:\n\n- At night and in adverse lighting conditions the recognition of road signs might fail due to iPhone camera limitations.\n- The app is optimized for European road signs. Unfortunately there is yet no support for US speed limits.\n- There is no support for 'end of limit' signs yet and no support for place/city signs that might also decrease the speed limit according to local traffic road regulations.\n- Sometimes road signs in narrow turns are missed due to the limited view angle of the camera\n- Sometimes there are missed or false road sign detections\n- Speedometer is updated every second\n\n► Notes from the developer\nIf you like Speed Limit warning Camera please rate the app. If you don't like it please send your suggestions by email to the developer team. If you want to get it ad-free please get the IAP and bear in mind that developing such a complicated app requires knowledge and time which should be rewarded. Please refrain from complaining about the pricing policy.\n\n► Disclaimer for Speedometer Radar Camera\nThe author of this app takes no liability whatsoever for any damages that may occur in connection with this app. In particular, all claims against the author are excluded. By using the app, the user recognizes this complete exclusion of liability and damage compensation.

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One!

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service.

When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

If you think we can improve GasAll, send us your comments in “settings” directly from the app. Thousands of users have already done it and it's what we like the most :)\n\nWith GasAll, filling the deposit will cost you a little less. We hope you enjoy the app!\n\nATTENTION\n\n* For your safety and for others: do not use your phone while driving. Set up the application with the vehicle stopped or with help from another person.\n* Fuel prices are updated daily based on the data provided by the Spanish Ministry of Industry. We are not responsible for any discrepancies in the displayed prices.\n* Valid only for gas stations located in Spain.\n* Although the application is designed for an efficient battery consumption, it is recommended to use a charger during long trips.\n* Requires internet connection to receive free price updates.\n* Activate the location of your device to show the nearest gas stations."

We are able to display coordinates in four formats on one screen:\n-\tDMS (Degrees, minutes, seconds)\n-\tDDM Degrees and decimal minutes\n-\tDD Decimal degrees\n-\tUTM Universal Transverse Mercator\n\nAdditional data that is displayed is altitude and GPS accuracy. Altitude is measured using three sources:\n-\tGPS receiver\n-\tNetwork API\n-\tbuilt-in barometer sensor\nUsing the data, we are able to display your position on Maps.\n\nOne of the most useful features is being able to take a photo with GPS coordinates overlayed on it. If you don’t want to take a picture, you can save your location by adding it to your places. In saved locations, you can find saved photos as well as saved places. Data history is recorded chronologically.\n\nThe S.O.S functionality allows  you to quickly send your GPS coordinates and a Google Maps link by  Messages to provided phone number(s) in settings. We can additionally provide text content that will appear in a message.\n\n\nOn the main screen as well as the history screen, you can share your GPS coordinates with your buddies via your social media profile, messenger apps or email.\n\nIn settings you can manage things like:\n\n-\tGPS data refresh rate interval (the more often the more battery life)\n-\tat what distance the GPS data should be refreshed (the more often the more battery life)\n-\taltitude units\n-\taccuracy units\n-\tspeed units\n-\tif saved photos should also be saved in your phones gallery\n-\ttext position and color in photos\n\nNOTICE:\nThe application contains advertisements, if you don’t want to see the ads or GPS data from plugged in, more precise GPS receivers such as Garmin GLO2, you can buy a subscription. By plugging into external GPS services, accuracy of the  received measurements increases to 1 foot.\n\nNOTICE:\nThe accuracy of the application depends on the sensitivity of the GPS receiver built into the phone. In most cases, the GPS modules embedded in the phone provide an accuracy of + - 10 m. GPS sensitivity also depends on the place of measurement:\nInferior measurements often inside buildings, between buildings and in bad weather.\nBetter in the open air, under a clear sky.\n\nTerms and conditions:  https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/mygpslocation\r\nPrivacy policy:              https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/mygpslocation"

      "label": "Speed Limit App displays the current speed limit and your current speed. It detects European speed limit signs using the camera while driving and enhances the results by map based limits from OpenStreetMap. Thus it will even know limits which are not indicated by signs (i.e. Zone 30, or inner city areas). Of course it will warn you when you are too fast. \n\n► Working principle of Speed Limit App\nSpeed Limit App is a road sign recognition app. For inner city limits we use map based information from OpenStreetMap. Both information is merged to provide an optimal limit indication. The speedometer gets its data from the GPS and is used to determine wether you are above or below the actual limit of the last detected road sign.\n\n► Limitations of Speed Limit App\nSpeedometer Radar Camera does a computational intensive job that formerly was limited to mainframes. Therefore there are some restrictions:\n\n- At night and in adverse lighting conditions the recognition of road signs might fail due to iPhone camera limitations.\n- The app is optimized for European road signs. Unfortunately there is yet no support for US speed limits.\n- There is no support for 'end of limit' signs yet and no support for place/city signs that might also decrease the speed limit according to local traffic road regulations.\n- Sometimes road signs in narrow turns are missed due to the limited view angle of the camera\n- Sometimes there are missed or false road sign detections\n- Speedometer is updated every second\n\n► Notes from the developer\nIf you like Speed Limit warning Camera please rate the app. If you don't like it please send your suggestions by email to the developer team. If you want to get it ad-free please get the IAP and bear in mind that developing such a complicated app requires knowledge and time which should be rewarded. Please refrain from complaining about the pricing policy.\n\n► Disclaimer for Speedometer Radar Camera\nThe author of this app takes no liability whatsoever for any damages that may occur in connection with this app. In particular, all claims against the author are excluded. By using the app, the user recognizes this complete exclusion of liability and damage compensation.

      "label": "MiraTrex PRO CHARTS™ is a powerful, yet easy-to-use marine navigation system. Whether you’re a fisherman, weekend cruiser, sailor, diver, jet-skier, or an offshore captain needing to find an exact location hundreds of miles offshore, PRO CHARTS™ will get you there and back home safely – with nothing more than your iPhone or iPad.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n• High-resolution NOAA nautical chart coverage with depths for all U.S. coastal areas, the Great Lakes, major U.S. river systems, and Brazil plus global high-level nautical charts. Charts are automatically updated based on NOAA chart corrections.\n\n• Easy one-touch Waypoint and Route creation. Pre-plan your routes at home or create them at sea with equal ease. Just touch the screen to create new waypoints and routes.\n\n• Find your friends on the water. With our new Buddy-tracking feature, you can see and meet up with your friends while you’re out on the water. If you’re on your secret spot and don’t want to be seen, you can hide your location with the touch of a button.\n\n• Stay safe. Easily create and send a Float Plan of your trip to a friend or family member. Your Float Plan and location history can be forwarded to search and rescue personnel in case of an emergency.\n\n• Easy point-and-steer navigation. The red heading bug on the large on-screen compass always directs you to the next point on your route. Navigation is as easy as pointing your boat at the heading bug to stay on course.\n\n• No Network. No Problem. PRO CHARTS™ is designed so no internet connection is required to view your charts while out on the water. You simply download in advance any charts you’ll need at sea with the touch of a button.\n\n• Record your tracks. Track your position in real-time and later view your track history.\n\n• Fully indexed point of interest (POI) database including weather, aids to navigation (markers and lights), obstructions, tides, currents, your buddies, and more.\n\n\nWebsite: www.miratrex.com\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nPlans:\n\nBase app with limited features - Free \n14 day trial of all premium features - Free\nAll premium features (Monthly) - $2.99\nAll premium features (Annual) - $29.99 (Save 16%, about 2 months free)\n\n\n\n-Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n-Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n-You will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for that product.\n\n-You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the Apple Settings app after purchase.\n\n-No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period. This does not affect your statutory rights.\n\n-Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.\n\n-We will be collecting information about your use of the app both when you are online and offline.

Though PRO CHARTS™ will function without a GPS as a chart reader, a GPS-enabled device is required for point-to-point navigation. Third-party Bluetooth GPS units are available to enable GPS for iOS devices such as WiFi-only iPads that do not include a GPS receiver. For offline use where no Internet connection is available, charts must be pre-cached while still on-line and connected, any charts downloaded while online will be available for offline use."

It always lets you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless the track is being recorded.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). As quite a lot of us are using external GPS modules, app is available for wifi only iPads and iPods.\n\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "The GPS Phone Tracking App makes it easy to keep track of life’s essentials; use it to:\n\n• Find Your Friends – and get directions to their location.\n• Find Your Phone – check the app’s Web site to find a lost device.\n• Stay Connected – discover your friends’ whereabouts at any time simply by checking the GPS Phone Tracking map.\n\nThe GPS Phone Tracking does it all.\nThis handy, easy-to-use app leverages the latest technology to help you stay connected in real time to the people (and the devices) that matter most. GPS Phone Tracking functions, features and benefits include:\n\nGreat Friend Locator.\nGPS Phone Tracking uses GPS coordinates and state-of-the-art GPS location data to report the real-time whereabouts of your friends. Simply install the GPS tracker app on your phone and your friends’ phones. Once registered, each friend appears as a unique icon on the GPS Tracking Pro’s navigational map so you’ll know exactly where each friend is, at all times. Want to know instantly which friends arrived at a party, theater, museum or another planned meet up point? Want to figure out if anyone is stuck in traffic, made a wrong turn or even worse – if your habitually late friend has even left his/her house yet? No need to send annoying “Where are your?” or “What’s your ETA?” texts, GPS Phone Tracking puts this information at your fingertips. And to make life super easy, GPS Tracking Pro can send alerts the moment your friends arrive at the appointed location!\n\nFriend Locator\nWith GPS Phone Tracking, you can monitor your friend’s travel from one location to another via the app’s GPS maps. This is a very helpful feature when you’re traveling separately from a friend who has a tendency to get lost often. And let’s face it: GPS Phone Tracking also makes a great family tracker. This is especially helpful if a family member is scheduled to pick you up. You can track their progress toward your destination, enjoying yourself until the last possible moment you have to be at the agreed upon pick up spot!\n\nReliable Cell Phone Tracker\nGPS Phone Tracking can pinpoint the location of registered mobile devices, smart phones and even old school feature phones via the app’s website, 24/7. Just log in and your phone will appear as an icon. Click on the icon to view the location of the missing mobile phone. This GPS phone tracking device helps with iPhone too. It accesses GPS iPhone data to pinpoint the location of missing Droids.\n\nPhone Tracking for Friends With Feature Phones\nFriends who don’t have the latest smart phone (or a smart phone at all), can still enjoy GPS Phone Tracking’s features and benefits – with a little help from their friends! Here’s how it works: The app will send a text invite to the feature phone. Once your friend accepts the invitation and replies with a “yes,” to the text, their individual icon will appear on the app’s GPS maps. If their phone is lost, the app will provide GPS navigation assistance to help you guide them its destination. It’s a phone tracker extraordinaire.\n\nInnovative and Versatile Phone Locator\nDo you constantly misplace your cell phone and are tired of asking other people (friends or family) to help you find it or if they’ve seen it? GPS Phone Tracking can help. Its state-of-the-art GPS system can keep tabs on registered phones, using satellites to triangulate the exact location of every phone registered to your account. If a phone is ever out of satellite view, GPS Phone Tracking uses triangulation via the nearest cell phone tower and the cell phone carrier’s data to determine the missing phone’s location. This versatile phone locator also offers printer-friendly directions to the misplaced phone’s location. GPS Phone Tracking is compatible with iPhone, whether you have AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or another phone carrier."

The application is convenient to use, as there is nothing superfluous in it, so you can easily create your first route. With simple taps on the map, the app will automatically get directions. Distances and routes are calculated automatically!\n\nThe application is very simple, but it has many possibilities, here are some of them:\n1. Create routes for running or walking;\n2. Calculate the distance from an object to objects on the map;\n3. Calculate the size of buildings, squares, roads, etc .;\n4. Calculate the area of ​​territories or objects on the map;\n5. Calculate the distance you covered in a day;\n6. As well as other possibilities that you yourself can think of.\n\nThere are three modes in the application:\n1) \"Route calculation\" - by placing markers on the map the application will calculate routes between them. The number of markers that you can place on the map is unlimited. You can calculate the route for walking, bike or car.\n2) \"Calculate distance\" - calculate the distance between markers in a straight line.\n3) \"Calculate the area on the map\" - After you set three markers on the map, the application will calculate the area of ​​this triangle. You can calculate the area of ​​almost any shape on the map.\n\nYou can use these modes in different ways, it all depends on your imagination!"

The Nexar app is constantly being upgraded and we’re committed to building a service that will improve your driving experience and eventually save lives.\n\nHOW DO I GET A NEXAR-POWERED DASH CAM?\nYou can order a dash cam right from the app or from buy.getnexar.com.\n\n---\n\nFEATURES\n\nRecords as you drive\nWhen paired to a compatible camera, Nexar starts recording automatically, whenever you start driving, and streams video to the app. The app works in the background so you can use other apps while driving.\n\nDetects dangerous incidents\nNexar uses AI algorithms and sensors to automatically capture dangerous incidents like hard brakes, sharp turns, and fast accelerations.\n\nProvides instant evidence\nIn case of an accident, the footage is automatically displayed on the Nexar app.\n\nBacks up to the cloud\nAll driving incidents are automatically uploaded to your free and secure Nexar cloud account.\n\n1-Click Report™  for insurance claims\nCreate detailed summaries of driving incidents, including place, time, impact, and footage, to save you time, money and unnecessary stress.\n\n360 Collision Detection\nNexar’s machine learning algorithms identify (and prove) all types of collisions, even when they occur beyond the camera’s frame.\n\nView & share your videos\nAfter every drive, you'll be able to see its summary, including the route and any incident clips that were recorded. Share these clips and other data with friends, family, or your insurance provider, directly through the app.\n\n---\n\n6 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW\nNexar saves what matters most. Your drives are saved to your phone based on available space. Dangerous incidents are automatically uploaded to your Nexar cloud, where they are never erased.\nNexar lets you control how much storage the app uses.\nThe dash cam connects to the app using its own WiFi signal. You’ll still be able to use your data plan.\nNexar won’t drain your data plan. The app uses data only after an incident was detected, to backup important evidence to your Nexar cloud account.\nYou can use Nexar to share your drives. Trim a driving clip and share it with your friends and family.\nYou own your data. We never share any individual’s data unless they authorize it.\n\n---\n\n24/7 SUPPORT\nNeed help? We're always here to assist. Reach us by email at support@getnexar.com or by in-app chat.\n\n---\n\nKEEP YOUR PHONE CHARGED\nAny app that uses GPS can deplete your phone battery faster, and Nexar is no different. That's why we recommend that you keep your phone charged while using Nexar - a charged phone is a happy phone!\n\n---\n\nRIDESHARE PROTECT PROGRAM\nNexar offers NY rideshare drivers a special subscription with premium features and an insurance discount with select NY insurance providers.\n\nAuto-renewable subscription payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period, your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

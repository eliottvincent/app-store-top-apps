When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "\"Gives you the best route to where you want to go\" - New York Times\n“You won't realize how much time you can save planning until you use this app” - LA Times\n“Killer app” - WSJ \n\"MBTA has a favorite transit app — and it's called Transit\" - Boston Globe\n\nTransit is your real-time urban travel companion. Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here. Honestly, these guys should be in charge of actual public transportation itself.\"\n\nCITIES\nTransit works in 200+ cities across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand (see USA list below).\n\nUSA\nAlbuquerque \nAnn Arbor\nAspen\nAtlanta*\nAustin*\nBaltimore (MTA*, RTA, Charm City Circulator*)\nBoston (MBTA*, Massport, MetroWest RTA, Brockton Area Transit (BAT), Lowell RTA, Plymouth & Brockton S.

Upgrading to Footpath Elite unlocks the following powerful features:\n\n\nTURN-BY-TURN NAVIGATION\n- Footpath will tell you when to turn with turn-by-turn audio cues on your iPhone and Apple Watch.\n- Save your route and cues in advance for voice guidance that works completely offline.\n- Double tap your AirPods or use the playback controls button on your headphones to replay your next cue. \n\nPREMIUM MAPS\n- 3D and topographic maps including Footpath Outdoors (Worldwide), USGS Topo Maps (U.S. and Canada), OpenCycleMap (Worldwide), and many more. \n- Cycling lanes, avalanche slope shading, and elevation contour lines.\n- Save places as favorites to customize your maps\n\nORGANIZE\n- Create and edit unlimited saved routes\n- Duplicate, merge, and split routes\n- Organize and sort routes into custom lists\n\nANALYZE\n- Calendar log and weekly summary of your activity\n- Analyze splits, speed, elevation, and heartrate\n- Speed heatmaps\n\nEXPORT\n- GPX import and export\n- TCX and FIT course export for turn-by-turn navigation on Garmin and Wahoo GPS devices\n- Export cue sheets to a spreadsheet app for customization and printing\n- Export routes and workouts to Apple Health\n\n\nYou can purchase a Footpath Elite monthly or yearly subscription through your iTunes account.

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the same cost as your original purchase.\n\n\nTIPS FOR MAPPING ROUTES\n• For longer routes, try zooming in and mapping your route in multiple segments.\n• Tap and hold the map to quickly route between waypoints and POIs.\n• Did Footpath snap to the wrong roads? Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser.

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One! Give it a rating and review on our Appstore page and don’t forget to share it with your friends and family! If you encounter a problem when using the app, please send us an email about it and we will work ASAP to fix it."

We are able to display coordinates in four formats on one screen:\n-\tDMS (Degrees, minutes, seconds)\n-\tDDM Degrees and decimal minutes\n-\tDD Decimal degrees\n-\tUTM Universal Transverse Mercator\n\nAdditional data that is displayed is altitude and GPS accuracy. Altitude is measured using three sources:\n-\tGPS receiver\n-\tNetwork API\n-\tbuilt-in barometer sensor\nUsing the data, we are able to display your position on Maps.\n\nOne of the most useful features is being able to take a photo with GPS coordinates overlayed on it. If you don’t want to take a picture, you can save your location by adding it to your places. In saved locations, you can find saved photos as well as saved places. Data history is recorded chronologically.\n\nThe S.O.S functionality allows  you to quickly send your GPS coordinates and a Google Maps link by  Messages to provided phone number(s) in settings. We can additionally provide text content that will appear in a message.\n\n\nOn the main screen as well as the history screen, you can share your GPS coordinates with your buddies via your social media profile, messenger apps or email.\n\nIn settings you can manage things like:\n\n-\tGPS data refresh rate interval (the more often the more battery life)\n-\tat what distance the GPS data should be refreshed (the more often the more battery life)\n-\taltitude units\n-\taccuracy units\n-\tspeed units\n-\tif saved photos should also be saved in your phones gallery\n-\ttext position and color in photos\n\nNOTICE:\nThe application contains advertisements, if you don’t want to see the ads or GPS data from plugged in, more precise GPS receivers such as Garmin GLO2, you can buy a subscription. By plugging into external GPS services, accuracy of the  received measurements increases to 1 foot.\n\nNOTICE:\nThe accuracy of the application depends on the sensitivity of the GPS receiver built into the phone. In most cases, the GPS modules embedded in the phone provide an accuracy of + - 10 m. GPS sensitivity also depends on the place of measurement:\nInferior measurements often inside buildings, between buildings and in bad weather.\nBetter in the open air, under a clear sky.\n\nTerms and conditions:  https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/mygpslocation\r\nPrivacy policy:              https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/mygpslocation"

Geographic or UTM projected coordinates are shown at all times.\n\nPOINT SURVEY\nThe application allows data collection of single points, whose coordinates are got from the GPS, showing the estimated precision by a circle, as is usual in location-based programs.\nThe points are automatically numbered, recording date and time, and can be separated in different layers. User can also enter point codes, choosing them from a quick list.\n\nCONTINUOUS SURVEY\nIt is also possible to perform a continuous survey, recording vertices automatically by an interval of time, distance or height difference.\nAt any time you can view the polyline data, such as minimum and maximum heights, length and area. Vertex information can be displayed as well.\nYou can work with multiple layers, with different names and colors.\n\nRESULTS\nSurvey can be exported to a KML file, that can be sent by email from the app. This file can also be imported by TcpMDT and other CAD and GIS applications.\n\nSETTINGS\nEditing preferences lets you to change the appearance of map, points and lines captured. It also sets parameters for data collection, information displayed in real time and others.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n• Operating System: iOS 7 or higher\n• Integrated GPS\n• Internet access"

Using audio messages, Lazarillo will tell you about nearby places,\n\nthe street you are walking on, street intersections in your way and more! Like a radio, Lazarillo will announce the things around you while you are moving.\n\nThis app was designed and implemented with active feedback from people who are blind.\n\nThe GPS resource is used even if the App is in the background. This allows the user to keep using the app without active usage of the screen, so they can\n\nstill enjoy the features of Lazarillo even when their phone is in their pocket or when using other relevant apps.\n\nNote : \"Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\"\n\nThis app allows you to use its accessibility functions for free, just requires mobile data or a Wi-Fi connection.\n\nTo collaborate with people who are blind, Lazarillo's main feature is to become the user's companion, providing essential information that allows displacement and autonomy.\n\nThe goal is to help the person reach the chosen place in a simple way, receiving Lazarillo indications by voice and notifications of nearby places, institutions,\n\nshops, etc, allowing communication between the user and the city.\n\nThe app contains the following features:\n\nExploration: Provides your actual position, nearby places, and street intersections while you are walking on the street, in a bus or by car.\n\nCategory searches: Allows to find nearby places from a specific category such as banks, health, food, shop, art, entertainment, etc.\n\nSpecific searches: Allows to find a route to any place using voice or keyboard.\n\nHelp information:\n\nLazarillo provides information about establishments that work with blind or visually impaired people. The app is linked to a web platform where the institutions\n\nare able to show important information about events, courses, workshops, and any data that a blind person may need. In that way Lazarillo collaborates\n\nwith these institutions improving the communication among users, providing better connectivity between people with visual disabilities.\n\nFor suggestions and doubts you can visit our web site www.lazarillo.cl\n\nor send us an e-mail to: contacto@lazarillo.cl"

      "label": "\"Probably the best map and route planner out there\" - recent customer review\nDon't take our word for it, join over 1 million users who rely on this app daily.\n\n● TRAVEL AT NIGHT ●\n● Now contains routing for the latest TfL night services.\n\n● KEY FEATURES ●\n● Simple, fast and easy to use.\n● Designed for the first time visitor and experienced commuter.\n● Unique \"Travel Explorer\" feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map.\n● Latest official TfL (Transport for London) map. \n● Saves and recalls favourite and recent journeys.\n● Online street map integration (when an internet connection is available).\n● Services can be turned on or off, routing around problems.\n● Easily locates your nearest transport stop.\n● Places of interest, parks etc are built in to the application.\n● Ability to mark up the map with favourite locations and areas.\n\n● OVERVIEW ● The London Underground application is a superb route planner for the London Underground system with many unique features. The inbuilt map provides the official view of the city underground services with the ability to switch to an online street map view when an internet connection is available. This way the user can view the online map feature when above ground and the transport map and route planning is still fully functional underground or anywhere there is no internet connection. \n\n● TRAVEL EXPLORER ● The unique travel explorer feature provides a view of travel times and distances from any location on the map. This is helpful for getting a sense of scale and connectivity of the transport system and can provide some interesting results. For example is it quicker to use the tube to go from Covent Garden to Tottenham Court Road or is it quicker on foot? (Hint, the quickest route will keep you fitter). No other application makes it so easy to get around on the tube and allow you to make travel decisions based on the actual distances and travel times on foot.\n\n● ROUTING ● Does not require an internet connection and will always be available to display a clear and detailed view of the city transport system, plus list and animate the optimum route for your journey. Provides the fastest route calculations of any mobile routing application (virtually instantaneous) using actual published journey times with the ability to select the quickest route or the route with the least changes.\nComprehensive details of your planned route are provided, including changes, directions of travel, number of stops, predicted journey times, etc. Uniquely this application gives you “direction”, “towards” and “service frequency” information (not available on any other offline journey planner) for example “Take the Northern line (Southbound) towards Stockwell for 10 mins (6 stops). Service runs every 7 minutes” which is essential when finding the correct platform and connection. Also given are alternatives for each leg of the journey.\n\n● NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED ● The map and routing do not require an internet connection and you will not be charged data connection fees. This also means the application runs perfectly underground, on an aeroplane, etc. For international visitors to a city who have data roaming turned off this is an ideal solution.\n\n● LIVE INFO ● When an internet connection is available, optional \"Live Information\" on the current state of the transport services and real time station departure boards can be viewed allowing you to plan your journeys in advance and avoid any potential delays.\n\n● MORE MAPS ● This map is one in a series of Zuti worldwide city maps, if you like this product you may also enjoy some of our other offerings, please visit www.zuti.co.uk for further information. This is the promotional version of the application, please see the app store for the advert free version.\n\n● NOTE ● Please note this is the free promotional (Pro) version and does contain advertising."

Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for seeing the difference in elevation of two points. Great for hiking and other outdoor activities. The Compass shows your real-time orientation in this elevation app.\n\n5-Star Reviews:\n\"I love this app, wherever I go snowmobiling or hiking I always use it.\"\n\n\"This app really works well. I enjoy checking the altitude wherever I am. Nice!\"\n\nA simple and uncluttered interface to read:\n• Altitude or Elevation\n• Latitude\n• Longitude\n\nFeatures\n• Highest GPS accuracy for your device\n• Ground elevation from topographical map values\n• View in feet or meters\n• Built-in flashlight\n\nSharing\n• Share screenshots with beautiful backgrounds\n• Share on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, or text message\n\nUse the Custom Background upgrade to take a photo from the top of a mountain and take a screenshot with your altitude overlaid to show your family & friends.\n\nBackgrounds (In-App purchases):\n• Meadow landscape (Illustrated)\n• Cityscape (Illustrated)\n• Mountains (Illustrated)\n• Abstract\n• Choose Your Own\n\nNote: Many customers with high altitude illnesses or sensitivities, such as chronic lung disease, asthma, COPD, & emphysema find this app useful for avoiding high altitudes. It is also used by hikers and climbers who want to avoid high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). However, the altitude shown is potentially subject to large inaccuracies and this app should NOT be used as a primary device for determining altitude for medical reasons."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service.

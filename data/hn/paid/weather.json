Smartphones are able to detect earthquakes thanks to the accelerometer on-board each device. When an earthquake is detected, users with the application installed are immediatly alerted. Since earthquake waves travel at around 5 km/s it is possible to alert the population not yet reached by the damaging waves of the earthquake. For the scientific details about the project please refer to the scientific paper on Frontiers at https://bit.ly/2C8B5HI\n\nSubscriptions:\n\nWhen an earthquake is detected in real time by smartphones near the epicenter, the server sends an alert to all users with the app. Alerting all users can take up to 10 seconds since it is not technically feasible to do so instantly. Now you can join the priority lists of the first 10,000 or 100,000 people alerted in real time. The following subscriptions are available:\n\n- Subscription 10k for 1 year\n- Subscription 10k for 1 month \n\n- Subscription 100k for 1 year\n- Subscription 100k for 1 month \n\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nPrivacy: https://www.sismo.app/privacy\n\nTerms and conditions: https://www.sismo.app/terms-conditions"

      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

In 1662 Christopher Wren invented the rocking rain gauge, the prototype of the modern rain gauges, which was perfected in 1670 by Robert Hooke.\nUp to about 10-20 years ago it was indicated as rain gauges those instruments that in fact they had no way to record the time evolution of the rain and which were controlled to a daily basis.\nUnlike the pluviograph was a tool that could, by means of a mechanical registration system, to graphically report the amount of rain fall in a certain time interval\nWith the development  of electronics and then computer science , the pluviographs have gone increasingly asserting itself.\n\n[Design]\n\nThe graphics are perfected to the last detail to make using simple, fluid and pleasant.\nOptimized for Retina Display on the iPhone and iPad.\n\n[Supported languages]\n\n• English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish.\n\n[Support]\n\nIf you like the app, don’t forget to leave us a review on the App Store.\nFor suggestions please contact us at info@lionsapp.com, or visit lionsapp.com."

I simply go on and see which species is \"hunt-able\" during this time of the year and I get my gear and go hunting! Very simple to use UI making it easy to have some joy in life!\n\nMuch more screenshots: \nwww.LifewareSolutions.com\n\nVideo:\nhttp://youtu.be/WWPykvtVvJM\n\nIf you like Hunting Aid, please write us a review on iTunes to keep free updates coming.

      "label": "What time is sunset today? Or sunrise tomorrow? When is the \"magic hour\" next March 20 in Paris? With Sol, you can check times and get reminders of solar events, at home or while traveling! Great for everyone looking to plan activities based on sunlight. Use it to remind you to walk the dog before dark, get up with the sun, or find golden hour time for that perfect photo.\n\nSol: Sun Clock is the Swiss-army knife of sunlight tools with a design inspired by the simplicity of the sundial. Use it to plan your day, guide natural sleep cycles, get the best light for outdoor photography, make sure animals or kids are safe inside before dark, or to map out the best times to go running or fishing. \n\n* Be in tune: Sol will tell you when the golden hour is, how much sunlight you have left in the day or what time the next sunrise occurs.\n\n* Look to the future, travel around the world: Sol lets you find sunlight information for any date, anywhere on earth. \n \n* Find solar midnight and solar noon, and all three twilight (dawn and dusk) periods: astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight. Keep tabs on the next solstice and equinox.\n \n* Reminders and Alarms: Use Sol as a natural alarm clock that you can set to any event (like sunset, golden hour or solar noon), and the alarm or reminder time will adjust gradually as the days change with the seasons.\n \n* Automatic Location: Sol not only calculates the amount of daylight and sunrise and sunset times, but does so for any location in the world (both Northern and Southern hemispheres) by using your device's GPS... no network connection required. \n\n* Other locations: Optionally, use the built-in map to choose any location in the world by moving the pin, or search using the name of any city.\n \n* Optional location-aware alarms. Sol knows when you change with your location; and as you travel it will adjust any alarms you set relative to sunrise and sunset times.  Create alarms for multiple locations around the world.\n\n* Detailed almanac information: Useful information about the day's length, sun's azimuth and elevation, equinoxes and solstices, and a friendly glossary that explains all the terms. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. However, GPS runs in the background ONLY if you have set location-aware alarms."

Use Radar HD to see what weather is coming your way!  \n\nRadar shows areas of current precipitation or future simulated radar prediction!. A weather radar is used to locate precipitation, calculate its motion, estimate its type (rain, snow, hail, etc.), and forecast its future position and intensity.  Precipitation type is indicated by the color. Green color indicates lesser precipitation while the yellow color code indicates intense precipitations. The color code red is indicative of the most intense precipitations. Blue color indicates snow.\n\nUsing the data from Storm Prediction Center and Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (SPC & GDAC) Radar HD provides information about tropical storms and hurricanes for locations worldwide, areas affected by storms and severe weather, coordinates and wind speed, storm tracks & path projections.\n\nSatellite images provide an excellent view on the clouds in the sky and an indication of the weather over the United states, Europe, Japan, Australia and Indonesia.\nSatellite images come from satellites which remain above a fixed point on the Earth (i.e. they are “geostationary”). Lighter areas of cloud show where the cloud tops are cooler and therefore where weather features like fronts and shower clouds are.\n\nThe app also allows you to check the weather on your favorite places on maps. Interactive map includes live international weather conditions, local weather and time, ten-day forecasts and sunrise/sunset times for multiple places. You can add placemarks on the map to represent your favorite places or the places you’d like to visit. At a glance you can see the time and weather for all of your favorites.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n* [NEW] Predictive weather radar \n* [NEW] Simulated radar prediction for the next 60 minutes using five-minute intervals\n* The real time radar images provided by NEXRAD an accurate view of the weather situation in the U.S.\n* Storm / hurricane / typhoon tracker and projected paths (International and Global)\n* All severe weather alerts on interactive map, 126 weather alert types (U.S.)\n* High resolution weather radar. Stunning and sharp images.

      "label": "One of the easiest ways to become a happier person is to experience more sunlight every day. Skylight can help make that happen through a beautiful app experience designed for everyone.\n\nCreate a routine around sunrise every morning. Remind yourself to step out at solar noon for a sun break. Take better photos by shooting during Golden Hour. Start getting outside to see the sunset more. Gain a better sense of sunlight lost and gained through the seasons and adjust your routine to make sure you get enough light. Motivate yourself through the winter months by reminding yourself that days are getting longer. The uses are endless but the goal is the same - better living through more sunlight.\n\nSkylight includes a universal app for iPad and iPhone, an Apple Watch app with complications, and three widgets. The Apple Watch complications show you how much sunlight is left in the day, or when upcoming events like Golden Hour are taking place. The complications are a beautiful addition to the watch face and offer one of the most effective ways to use the app. The Today Widget shows you the app information in a quick, glanceable form, so daylight info is always at your fingertips, either in your Today view or with a 3D Touch on the app icon.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Beautiful fluid visual display showing the position of the sun over time.\n- Comprehensive notifications & alarms for daily and yearly sun events.\n- Three different configurable widgets: Year Graph, Daylight Graph, and Gradient.\n- Apple Watch app and complications with daylight clock and events.\n- Year view, showing the entire year's daily sun events with a simple drag of your finger.\n- Detailed event views, describing each sun event and showing the earliest and latest. dates on which it occurs.\n- Date picker to see sun information from dates in the past or future.\n- Location picker to see sun events and graphs for anywhere on earth.\n- Multiple time modes, including specialized modes for photography and science.\n- Support for all display sizes and device orientations.\n- Spotlight support, so you can just type \"Golden Hour\" from your phone's home screen to pull up today's info.\n- Skylight can optionally use GPS in the background to ensure notifications are correct even if you change location.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nSkylight is an indie app developed by the creators of Magic Window. We strive to make beautiful software that connects people with the world. If you have any issues or questions please contact us at support@jetsoncreative.com."

Tidal information is essential for navigating a shallow waterway or placing your boat at anchor.  The success or failure of a voyage can depend on the height or depth of a tide, while knowledge of current information can save fuel and make passage into a river or channel safer. \n\nTides PRO goes further than the tables provided by the NOAA. The app automatically accounts for correction factors and provides instant information without requesting that you account for time lags, daylight savings conventions, or height differences between the reference stations and the locations you are seeking. \n\nSince the tidal information that is published in this app is not subjected to the use of the voyage, please do not use for navigation."

      "label": "Weather forecasts and radar for weather nerds!\n\n*****\nFeatured by Apple, MacRumors, CNet, App Advice and more!  \"Weather Nerd is a comprehensive package in a gorgeous wrapper.\"\n*****\n\nWHAT'S NEW?\n\n - Optimized for All Sizes of Devices\n - Siri Support\n - Bolder, Larger Text\n - Tons of New Measurements Like Humidity, Pressure, etc\n - Forecasts for Your Calendar Events\n\nTOP FEATURES\n\n - Detailed daily reports (up to a year out)\n - Minute-to-minute precipitation (see coverage below)\n - Weather radar and satellite\n - 3 widgets (next hour, day, week)\n\nPurchase includes one year full access. After a year, you can renew via an in-app purchase. \n\n########################################\n\nCOVERAGE\n\nWeather reports are available for nearly anywhere in the world. If in doubt, go to http://darksky.net and try your location to see if you like the report.\n\nRadar is currently North America only.\n\nThe hour forecast is currently limited to US, UK, Ireland.\n\n\nDAILY COMPARISON\n\nWhen you're getting dressed, what do you want to know?\n\n\"How does today compare with yesterday?\"\n\nWeather Nerd includes a nice daily comparison:\n\n\"Today is 9° cooler than yesterday. No rain.\"\n\nThis makes it easy to grab the right coat.\n\n\nMINUTE-TO-MINUTE FORECAST\n\nWeather Nerd also gives you minute-by-minute rain predictions for your exact GPS location. Powered by Dark Sky's cutting edge \"hyperlocal precipitation forecasting system\", these reports show you a nice graph of the rain intensity for the next hour based on your exact location.  For example, you might see:\n\n\"Light rain starting in 10 minutes, stopping 15 minutes later.\"\n\n\nDAILY FORECAST\n\nThe daily forecast screen shows you a graph of the temperature, rain, and wind for today. Touch anywhere on the graph to view the forecast for a specific time. See more details at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\nWEEKLY FORECAST\n\nThe weekly forecast shows you a quick graph of the projected highs and lows for the next week, along with the chance of rain. Touch any day to view the full forecast for that day.\n\n\nBEYOND 7 DAYS\n\nNeed to see the forecast for two weeks or two months out? No problem. Weather Nerd's calendar lets you view the forecast for any date within the next year. \n\n\nNERD OUT\n\nFor the real weather nerds, the \"Nerd Out\" feature will list out ALL of the weather information.\n\n\nNERD ALERTS\n\nWeather Nerd lets you setup a daily weather forecast alert (in 15 minute intervals). You can turn the alert on/off for certain days of the week.\n\nIf you set your alert to 6pm or later, then the forecast will be for \"tomorrow's\" weather.\n\n\nNERD WIDGETS\n\nSome of you nerds like to use iPhone and iPad widgets. No problem. Weather Nerd comes packaged with 3 different widgets for your viewing pleasure including graphs for the \"Next Hour\", \"Today\", and \"Week\".\n\n\n========================\n\nWhy a subscription? The average nerd checks weather 4-5 times a day. Over a year, that alone cost nearly 1 USD to our providers. That's not counting additional data used for radar tiles, alerts, widgets, multiple devices, servers, etc. It would be completely unsustainable to charge a one time fee for a lifetime of data.\n\nWeather Nerd uses auto-renewing subscriptions. The Nerd Club subscription provides full access to weather reports, radar, widgets, and notifications. The subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase within the app. Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of your subscription period and will be charged through your iTunes account. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings. Cancellation of the current active subscription period is not allowed. \n\nTerms of Use: http://www.allstarapps.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy Policy:  http://www.allstarapps.com/privacy-policy"

      "label": "Best Fishing Times tells you the best time of the day or night to catch more and bigger fish. You've probably heard that the best times to fish are at dawn and dusk, but there's more to it than that. This app can help you consistently catch your limit by giving you the exact times to hit the water!  Click \"...More\" to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n*****  Featured in \"New and Newsworthy\" and \"What's Hot\"  *****\n\n*****\n\"All I can say is I took my two boys out during the time it said.... 2 catfish, 2 brim, 1 small mouth bass. We are not fisherman just a dad and 2 boys\"\n-- David\n\nPlanning a fishing trip? Don't head down to the water before you put Best Fishing Times in your virtual tackle box. Whether you're new to fishing or a seasoned angler, this app helps ensure your success no matter where on Earth you fish. \n\nBest Fishing Times Features Include:\n* Choose a location by Manual Entry, Auto GPS or Select from Map \n* Major & Minor Feeding and Activity Periods \n* Day ratings \n* Activity Index for the day rating \n* Moon rise, Moon set and Moon Transit times \n* Moon Phase Data \n* Sunrise, Sunset and Sun Transit times \n* Day / Weekly view \n* Weather conditions and forecasts (USA)\n* Date selection for checking Solunar data in advance \n* Any Date or Location \n* Check time zone settings \n* Graphical sun and moon simulator \n* Compass \n* Wind forecast for fly fishing (data available for the USA only)\nYou've probably heard the phrase \"Timing is everything\", and those words are especially true for fishing. It's not enough to know where the fish are. If you want to catch them, you have to know when they're going to be biting. \n\nEveryone knows there are certain times of the day or night that fish are more active; and until now, most people have relied on pure luck to get their line in the water during those times. Of course there have always been dedicated anglers who don't believe in luck. They spend hours before a fishing trip checking weather conditions, studying moon phase charts and performing complicated conversions for sun and moon positions, geographical location, time zone changes and other variables. Sound like a lot of work? It doesn't have to be.\n\nNo matter which of these two groups you fall into, Best Fishing Times was designed for you! This app takes luck out of the equation, and eliminates the need for math and charts. Just pick your fishing location and the date you want to fish, and get all the information you could ever want before you even leave home. Whether you're planning for next week or next year, Best Fishing Times will get you to the water at the right time of day to catch your limit.\n\nWith a few taps of your finger, you'll see the best day of any week to go fishing, and the times of day the fish will be most active. If you prefer to check the data yourself, Best Fishing Times puts all of the information right at your fingertips, including moon phase, moon rise and moon set, major and minor activity periods for any day, and even includes a graphical sun and moon simulator!\n\nYou wouldn't go to the ball park without knowing whether or not there's a game scheduled, so why would you go fishing without knowing when the fish are biting? Download Best Fishing Times now and stop casting blindly. You'll spend less time fishing and more time catching."

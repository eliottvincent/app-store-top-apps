Svaka lekcija se sastoji od arapskog teksta za dati harf sa audio zapisom, vježbe i video materijala sa objašnjenjima.\n\nOnaj ko vješto uči Kur'an biće u društvu sa plemenitim, čistim i časnim melekima. A onaj ko s poteškoćom uči Kur'an imaće dvije nagrade poručuje nam naš Poslanik, a.s.\nNišta tako nije bilo mistificirano i predstavljanjo teškim i komplikovanim u našem narodu kao što je učenje čitanja Kur’ana na arapskom jeziku. Tome su doprinjeli kako pogrešni metodološki pristupi učitelja tako i sufare koje su bile preobimne i teške za čitati.\n\nSuočen sa izazovom da olakša učenje harfova imam Asim ef. Hasanspahić je prije 20 godina napisao lekcije sufare koju imate pred sobom, a website je 2011. napravio imam Ermin ef. Zahirović, te je tako sufara.ba stekla veliku popularnost. \n\nZadovoljstvo nam je predstaviti redizajniranu sufaru.ba, sa aplikacijama za obje mobilne platforme, kojoj su dodate video lekcije koje je napravio Sejid ef. Strika.\n\nBitno je naglasiti da danas, pored svih tehnoloških pomagala, nemamo opravdanje da ne naučimo čitati Kur'an na izvornom, arapskom pismu.\n\nNadamo se da će vam ovi materijali olakšati učenje arapskog pisma i da ćete se jednom dovom sjetiti svih onih koji su pomogli da ova aplikacija ugleda svjetlo dana."

      "label": "Learn German with 5 minutes of practice daily. Mondly is the quick fix that will teach you core German words and German phrases for conversation, just like a phrasebook. \n\nWith Mondly you can learn German sentences and expressions FREE with daily German language lessons online. This app is the effective way for beginners to study verbs, pronunciation and how to speak like a native with daily practice.\n\nThe secret path to language learning\nRemember the German language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of German grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a local. Does it sound familiar? That’s the traditional way to learn a language. But it’s not the fastest and not the most efficient way.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nThis is how the future of language courses looks like\nThe App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn German phrases.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\nState-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your German words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak German clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\nUseful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of words is not the way to go when it comes to learning German.\n\nLearn conversational German. Unless you plan on reading science books, conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core German vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs and speak German clearly.\n\nVerb conjugations. Conversations are fun, but the foundation of a foreign language is grammar. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the German verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.\n\nThe Leaderboard. We made learning easy and fun, so why not throw in some more game elements, such as score? See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly family.\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these German lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language. Kids will love it as well.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com"

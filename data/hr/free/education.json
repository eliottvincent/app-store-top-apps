      "label": "SafeExamBrowser (SEB) is a secure kiosk web browser environment used to carry out e-assessments that run on exam servers. SEB opens a web browser without an address and search bar, loads a pre-configured webpage and locks an iPad (or iPhone or iPod Touch) into a single app kiosk mode. This mode prevents students from switching to other apps, accessing websites and communicating with other students during an exam. SEB enables secure exams on unmanaged iOS devices like students' own iPads as well as on iOS devices owned and managed by an institution. SEB doesn't use a centralized server or cloud service; it can be configured with an API, config files and config links. It can be used with most web-based quiz and e-assessment systems. For improved security and usability, some exam systems provide additional built-in support for SEB. Currently, SEB integrates especially well with learning management systems (LMS) such as Moodle, ILIAS, OpenOLAT and with several non-commercial and commercial exam systems, such as Inspera Assessment, Dugga, Exam.net or EvaExam.\n\nSEB uses one of the single app modes provided by iOS. After an exam is submitted, SEB can automatically end the app self-lock kiosk mode (an exam invigilator could also use a quit password to end the SEB exam session and unlock the device if necessary). \n\nSEB features an optional Dock displaying buttons for various commands. Instead or in addition, a left slider menu shows a list of open browser tabs and commands which can be used to (if enabled in settings) quit an exam session, jump back to the start page of an exam, reload a web page or search text on it, and navigate back/forward in the browsing history. \n\nSEB for iOS uses the same format for encrypted .seb configuration files as the SEB versions for other platforms. Those config files allow to individually configure SEB to display the start page of an exam system or an exam portal page with a list of links to current exams. If SEB for iOS is installed using a mobile device management (MDM) system, its initial configuration can easily be deployed using the \"MDM Managed Configuration\" feature. You can also directly start an exam with an individual configuration in SEB for iOS using a special config hyperlink. This link can be opened by examinees from Safari, Mail or a messenger app. In addition, you can use QR codes containing SEB links. An exam can directly be started in SEB by using the iOS Camera app or the built-in QR code scanner. \n\nSEB also works together with Apple Classroom, teachers can start individually configured exams on all student devices. See https://safeexambrowser.org/ios for more information.\n\n\nSafeExamBrowser for iOS was developed by Daniel R. Schneider, ETH Zurich, Educational Development and Technology (LET), based on the original idea of Safe Exam Browser by Stefan Schneider, University of Giessen\nProject concept: Thomas Piendl, Daniel R. Schneider, Damian Büchel, Andreas Hefti, Dirk Bauer, Michael Kern, Kai Reuter, Tobias Halbherr, Karsten Burger, Marco Lehre, Brigitte Schmucki, Oliver Rahs.\n\nSafe Exam Browser is released as freeware. The code is subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may only use these files in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/ .\n\nImportant parts of this project have been carried out as part of the program \"AAA/SWITCH – e-Infrastructure for e-Science\" led by SWITCH, the Swiss National Research and Education Network and the cooperative project \"Learning Infrastructure\" (part of the CRUS program \"Information scientifique: accès, traitement et sauvegarde\") coordinated by SWITCH, and was supported by funds from the ETH Board and the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)."

Of course you can have a closer look at every single exam you created. To every mark you can assign a weighting a date and a note.\nThe app also calculates your overall average. It is designed very universal, so all sorts of grading systems should be compatible.\n\nIn the second tab you can arrange your own timetable. Due to the fact that the agenda is directly integrated into the timetable you can see immediately if for a particular lesson an exam is announced or homework has to be done.\n\nIf that is not enough, you can buy the PRO version using in-app-purchase. All sorts of features will then be unlocked. For example the averages can be displayed rounded or you can turn on notifications for exams or tests and so on..\n\nIn my book, these are enough reasons to just download School Marks Manager and convince yourself that this app is by far the best one in its category! ;-)"

You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York. Lively, colorful, and sometimes surprising characters: an eccentric old lady will help you find a place to live, and a greedy hot-dog vendor who will try to short-change… They (and many more) speak different accents and will help you master street talk. There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go. Each conversation takes no more than 3 minutes and will fit into even the busiest of schedules.\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY\n\nYou’ll learn 6,000 of the most common words everyone needs to travel, work, and communicate in a foreign language. Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations. Built-in games will challenge your skill and speed – you can even compete with other users around the world in real-time!"

If you don't want to take a test, you can use the practice mode or let your kids unscramble the words\n\n- Practice spelling on the go.  This app is perfect for using no matter where you are.\n\n- HUGE time saver!  Finally kids can rapidly boost their spelling test scores without your help.  \n\n- Submit homework by email!

Create a test\n1.1. Choose the list name\n1.2. Add words - words are immediately checked for spelling to avoid mistakes\n1.3. For each word you add, record your own audio - a kids favorite\n\n2. Take a test\n2.1. Listen to the word you need to spell - words appear in random order\n2.2. Write the word and click next\n2.3. Instantly see if you got it right or wrong \n\n3. Review test scores\n3.1 Each time you take a test, you see a detailed report with all the words you got right and wrong.\n3.2 Next to each word, you see a green (correct) or red (wrong) indicator so you can quickly see what words kids tend to struggle with repeatedly.\n3.3 Next to each Spelling List you see the test results of the last test they took\n\nADVANCED OPTIONS\n\nAce it - Instead of taking a regular test, when you click to \"Ace it\" you have to keep repeating words until you spell them correctly.

      "label": "Aplikacija ICT-AAC Pisalica olakšava učenje pravilnog pisanja velikih tiskanih slova (grafema) koje nije dovoljno zastupljeno u dostupnim aplikacijama. Poznato je da je poznavanje i imenovanje slova, uz fonološku svjesnost, jedan je od najznačajnijih pretkazatelja spremnosti za poduku čitanja. Osim samog imenovanja slova, od djece se već početkom školovanja očekuje da savladaju pravilnu orijentaciju pisanja slova te pravilo pisanja za svako slovo. Međutim, djeca predškolske dobi često sama pokušavaju pisati slova prema primjerima koja vide u svojoj okolini (primjerice iz slikovnica, novina, s jumbo plakata). Nerijetko djeca tako upamte pogrešnu orijentaciju slova (poznato kao zrcalno pisanje) ili pogrešni smjer pisanja. Takav pogrešno naučen način pisanja često je teško ispraviti. Aplikacija je namijenjena djeci predškolske i školske dobi.\n\nUpotreba aplikacije\n\nPočetni zaslon aplikacije nudi pregled svih velikih tiskanih slova hrvatske abecede koji slijedi aktualni kurikulum iz hrvatskog jezika. Odabirom pojedinog slova otvara se pregled na kojem se slovo prikazuje u punoj veličini zaslona. Na svakom slovu prikazuju se strelice koje pokazuju ispravan smjer pisanja. Povlačenjem prsta po strelicama dijete ispisuje određeni oblik slova i na jedan suvremeni i zabavan način svladava predvještine pisanja."

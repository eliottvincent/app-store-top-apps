Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "SafeExamBrowser (SEB) is a secure kiosk web browser environment used to carry out e-assessments that run on exam servers. SEB opens a web browser without an address and search bar, loads a pre-configured webpage and locks an iPad (or iPhone or iPod Touch) into a single app kiosk mode. This mode prevents students from switching to other apps, accessing websites and communicating with other students during an exam. SEB enables secure exams on unmanaged iOS devices like students' own iPads as well as on iOS devices owned and managed by an institution. SEB doesn't use a centralized server or cloud service; it can be configured with an API, config files and config links. It can be used with most web-based quiz and e-assessment systems. For improved security and usability, some exam systems provide additional built-in support for SEB. Currently, SEB integrates especially well with learning management systems (LMS) such as Moodle, ILIAS, OpenOLAT and with several non-commercial and commercial exam systems, such as Inspera Assessment, Dugga, Exam.net or EvaExam.\n\nSEB uses one of the single app modes provided by iOS. After an exam is submitted, SEB can automatically end the app self-lock kiosk mode (an exam invigilator could also use a quit password to end the SEB exam session and unlock the device if necessary). \n\nSEB features an optional Dock displaying buttons for various commands. Instead or in addition, a left slider menu shows a list of open browser tabs and commands which can be used to (if enabled in settings) quit an exam session, jump back to the start page of an exam, reload a web page or search text on it, and navigate back/forward in the browsing history. \n\nSEB for iOS uses the same format for encrypted .seb configuration files as the SEB versions for other platforms. Those config files allow to individually configure SEB to display the start page of an exam system or an exam portal page with a list of links to current exams. If SEB for iOS is installed using a mobile device management (MDM) system, its initial configuration can easily be deployed using the \"MDM Managed Configuration\" feature. You can also directly start an exam with an individual configuration in SEB for iOS using a special config hyperlink. This link can be opened by examinees from Safari, Mail or a messenger app. In addition, you can use QR codes containing SEB links. An exam can directly be started in SEB by using the iOS Camera app or the built-in QR code scanner. \n\nSEB also works together with Apple Classroom, teachers can start individually configured exams on all student devices. See https://safeexambrowser.org/ios for more information.\n\n\nSafeExamBrowser for iOS was developed by Daniel R. Schneider, ETH Zurich, Educational Development and Technology (LET), based on the original idea of Safe Exam Browser by Stefan Schneider, University of Giessen\nProject concept: Thomas Piendl, Daniel R. Schneider, Damian Büchel, Andreas Hefti, Dirk Bauer, Michael Kern, Kai Reuter, Tobias Halbherr, Karsten Burger, Marco Lehre, Brigitte Schmucki, Oliver Rahs.\n\nSafe Exam Browser is released as freeware. The code is subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may only use these files in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/ .\n\nImportant parts of this project have been carried out as part of the program \"AAA/SWITCH – e-Infrastructure for e-Science\" led by SWITCH, the Swiss National Research and Education Network and the cooperative project \"Learning Infrastructure\" (part of the CRUS program \"Information scientifique: accès, traitement et sauvegarde\") coordinated by SWITCH, and was supported by funds from the ETH Board and the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)."

Agenda\n\nMy suggestion: Since the app is free of charge and add-free, just download the app and convince yourself of the simplicity and reliability.\n\nNevertheless here some information about the three aforementioned main features:\n\nIn the Marks Management tab the app always shows you the current averages of all your subjects. Of course you can have a closer look at every single exam you created. To every mark you can assign a weighting a date and a note.\nThe app also calculates your overall average. It is designed very universal, so all sorts of grading systems should be compatible.\n\nIn the second tab you can arrange your own timetable. Due to the fact that the agenda is directly integrated into the timetable you can see immediately if for a particular lesson an exam is announced or homework has to be done.\n\nIf that is not enough, you can buy the PRO version using in-app-purchase. All sorts of features will then be unlocked. For example the averages can be displayed rounded or you can turn on notifications for exams or tests and so on..\n\nIn my book, these are enough reasons to just download School Marks Manager and convince yourself that this app is by far the best one in its category! ;-)"

Izradom edukativnog programa „Poslovni uspjeh kroz društveno poduzetništvo“, obuhvatila su se gotovo sva područja znanja, koja bi jedan socijalni poduzetnik trebao imati te se izradio i Online tečaj istog. Time se ostvaruje mjera 10. „Ulaganje u obrazovanje, osposobljavanje i strukovno osposobljavanje za vještine i cjeloživotno učenje“ Operativnog programa učinkoviti ljudski potencijali 2014.-2020. te Inicijativa „Program za nove vještine i radna mjesta“ Europe 2020. \r\nKako bi što više korisnika moglo steći nova znanja i vještine, izrađena je mobilna aplikacija pod nazivom O društvenom poduzetništvu na kojoj su dostupne sve informacije o istome kao i navedeni Online tečaj. Realizacija ovog projekta doprinosi promicanju društvenog poduzetništva kroz poticanje i osiguranje kapaciteta budućih društvenih poduzetnika. Budući da se u Istarskoj županiji nalazi najveći broj registriranih poduzeća od svih županija (prema sudskom registru), smatra se kako su ovdje idealni uvjeti za razvoj novih društvenih poduzetnika i osvješćivanje postojećih poduzetnika za pogodnosti koje ima ako promijene način upravljanja poslovanja. Vrijednost ulaganja u ovaj projekt je značajna zato što se uvelike radi na promociji društvenog poduzetništva, educiranju mladih i nezaposlenih osoba o upravljanju poslovanjem te stjecanju ostalih vještina potrebnih za uspješno vođenje društvenog poduzeća kao i aktivnom uključivanju osoba s invaliditetom u zajednicu i pomoć prilikom njihova zapošljavanja."

Ukupno, korisnici imaju na raspolaganju šest mogućih ”težina” igre u okviru kojih pogađaju glasove na više od 200 odabranih riječi. Uz svaku zadanu riječ korisnicima se prikazuje sličica koja predstavlja pojam koji odgovara zadanoj riječi. Omogućeno je i izgovaranje cijele riječi kao i slovkanje riječi glas po glas."

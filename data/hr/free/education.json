Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Agenda\n\nMy suggestion: Since the app is free of charge and add-free, just download the app and convince yourself of the simplicity and reliability.\n\nNevertheless here some information about the three aforementioned main features:\n\nIn the Marks Management tab the app always shows you the current averages of all your subjects. Of course you can have a closer look at every single exam you created. To every mark you can assign a weighting a date and a note.\nThe app also calculates your overall average. It is designed very universal, so all sorts of grading systems should be compatible.\n\nIn the second tab you can arrange your own timetable. Due to the fact that the agenda is directly integrated into the timetable you can see immediately if for a particular lesson an exam is announced or homework has to be done.\n\nIf that is not enough, you can buy the PRO version using in-app-purchase. All sorts of features will then be unlocked. For example the averages can be displayed rounded or you can turn on notifications for exams or tests and so on..\n\nIn my book, these are enough reasons to just download School Marks Manager and convince yourself that this app is by far the best one in its category! ;-)"

      "label": "\"If you want your kid to be a better speller, then download this app now!  With this app spelling tests become a fun activity that your kids look forward to each time.\"\n\nEndorsed by tens of thousands of satisfied parents, teachers, and kids the world over. \n\nWHAT MAKES A+ SPELLING TEST UNIQUE?\n- Setup your own spelling tests in minutes\n\n- You decide which words to add and practice\n\n- Track your kids progress and quickly see how they are doing for each test they took as well as which words if any they are struggling with.\n\n- Multiple play modes keep kids engaged.  If you don't want to take a test, you can use the practice mode or let your kids unscramble the words\n\n- Practice spelling on the go.  This app is perfect for using no matter where you are.\n\n- HUGE time saver!  Finally kids can rapidly boost their spelling test scores without your help.  \n\n- Submit homework by email!  After taking a spelling test, just click to submit the results instantly to your teacher.\n\nEXCLUSIVE PRO FEATURES (unlocked via in-app-purchase)\n● Import spelling lists across devices\n● Share Spelling lists with parents, students, and teachers by email\n● Easily sort your spelling lists\n● Supports landscape and portrait mode\n● Create users accounts to backup spelling lists online\n● Import existing spelling lists by grade\n● Includes over 400 spelling lists in total\n● Spelling lists include over 6,300 words\n\nHOW TO USE A+ SPELLING TEST?\n\n1. Create a test\n1.1. Choose the list name\n1.2. Add words - words are immediately checked for spelling to avoid mistakes\n1.3. For each word you add, record your own audio - a kids favorite\n\n2. Take a test\n2.1. Listen to the word you need to spell - words appear in random order\n2.2. Write the word and click next\n2.3. Instantly see if you got it right or wrong \n\n3. Review test scores\n3.1 Each time you take a test, you see a detailed report with all the words you got right and wrong.\n3.2 Next to each word, you see a green (correct) or red (wrong) indicator so you can quickly see what words kids tend to struggle with repeatedly.\n3.3 Next to each Spelling List you see the test results of the last test they took\n\nADVANCED OPTIONS\n\nAce it - Instead of taking a regular test, when you click to \"Ace it\" you have to keep repeating words until you spell them correctly.  Since feedback and repetition is the best way to learn, your kids will improve even faster and enjoy it because by the end they will have aced every test!\n\nPractice - The practice mode does not track your score and offers a quick preview of each word when needed with just one click.  Its a fun and easy way to get familiar with especially challenging new words.\n\nUnscramble - The unscramble mode activates and develops a completely different part of your brain.  Instead of instantly hearing the word and having to spell it, you see a scramble of letters and have to figure out what word they are for.  It's fun and another great way to sharpen your kids spelling skills\n\nReview mistakes - With each test you took, you can choose to quickly just retest any / all mistakes.  In addition, on the main page, you can always click to review all the words that were misspelled on their last attempt.\n\nEnhanced email submission - Can't remember your kids teachers email?  No problem.  Enter it only once on the settings page and each time you click to email out the test, the teacher's email address will be pre-filled in the TO field.\n\nClear Test Scores - at any time, you can delete all previous test scores from the settings page with one click or delete individual test scores one at a time.\n\nHEROIC SUPPORT\n\nHeroic Support is not just what we do.

The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you.

      "label": "SafeExamBrowser (SEB) is a secure kiosk web browser environment used to carry out e-assessments that run on exam servers. SEB opens a web browser without an address and search bar, loads a pre-configured webpage and locks an iPad (or iPhone or iPod Touch) into a single app kiosk mode. This mode prevents students from switching to other apps, accessing websites and communicating with other students during an exam. SEB enables secure exams on unmanaged iOS devices like students' own iPads as well as on iOS devices owned and managed by an institution. SEB doesn't use a centralized server or cloud service; it can be configured with an API, config files and config links. It can be used with most web-based quiz and e-assessment systems. For improved security and usability, some exam systems provide additional built-in support for SEB. Currently, SEB integrates especially well with learning management systems (LMS) such as Moodle, ILIAS, OpenOLAT and with several non-commercial and commercial exam systems, such as Inspera Assessment, Dugga, Exam.net or EvaExam.\n\nSEB uses one of the single app modes provided by iOS. After an exam is submitted, SEB can automatically end the app self-lock kiosk mode (an exam invigilator could also use a quit password to end the SEB exam session and unlock the device if necessary). \n\nSEB features an optional Dock displaying buttons for various commands. Instead or in addition, a left slider menu shows a list of open browser tabs and commands which can be used to (if enabled in settings) quit an exam session, jump back to the start page of an exam, reload a web page or search text on it, and navigate back/forward in the browsing history. \n\nSEB for iOS uses the same format for encrypted .seb configuration files as the SEB versions for other platforms. Those config files allow to individually configure SEB to display the start page of an exam system or an exam portal page with a list of links to current exams. If SEB for iOS is installed using a mobile device management (MDM) system, its initial configuration can easily be deployed using the \"MDM Managed Configuration\" feature. You can also directly start an exam with an individual configuration in SEB for iOS using a special config hyperlink. This link can be opened by examinees from Safari, Mail or a messenger app. In addition, you can use QR codes containing SEB links. An exam can directly be started in SEB by using the iOS Camera app or the built-in QR code scanner. \n\nSEB also works together with Apple Classroom, teachers can start individually configured exams on all student devices. See https://safeexambrowser.org/ios for more information.\n\n\nSafeExamBrowser for iOS was developed by Daniel R. Schneider, ETH Zurich, Educational Development and Technology (LET), based on the original idea of Safe Exam Browser by Stefan Schneider, University of Giessen\nProject concept: Thomas Piendl, Daniel R. Schneider, Damian Büchel, Andreas Hefti, Dirk Bauer, Michael Kern, Kai Reuter, Tobias Halbherr, Karsten Burger, Marco Lehre, Brigitte Schmucki, Oliver Rahs.\n\nSafe Exam Browser is released as freeware. The code is subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may only use these files in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/ .\n\nImportant parts of this project have been carried out as part of the program \"AAA/SWITCH – e-Infrastructure for e-Science\" led by SWITCH, the Swiss National Research and Education Network and the cooperative project \"Learning Infrastructure\" (part of the CRUS program \"Information scientifique: accès, traitement et sauvegarde\") coordinated by SWITCH, and was supported by funds from the ETH Board and the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)."

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture. In contrast to a geo-cache or a scavenger hunt Actionbound requires the players to create their own content."

Agenda\n\nMy suggestion: Since the app is free of charge and add-free, just download the app and convince yourself of the simplicity and reliability.\n\nNevertheless here some information about the three aforementioned main features:\n\nIn the Marks Management tab the app always shows you the current averages of all your subjects. Of course you can have a closer look at every single exam you created. To every mark you can assign a weighting a date and a note.\nThe app also calculates your overall average. It is designed very universal, so all sorts of grading systems should be compatible.\n\nIn the second tab you can arrange your own timetable. Due to the fact that the agenda is directly integrated into the timetable you can see immediately if for a particular lesson an exam is announced or homework has to be done.\n\nIf that is not enough, you can buy the PRO version using in-app-purchase. All sorts of features will then be unlocked. For example the averages can be displayed rounded or you can turn on notifications for exams or tests and so on..\n\nIn my book, these are enough reasons to just download School Marks Manager and convince yourself that this app is by far the best one in its category! ;-)"

U tom smislu uključuje prepoznavanje prvog, zadnjeg ili svih glasova riječi. Kako bi se omogućilo postepeno učenje, aplikacija zadatke razlikuje prema složenosti riječi. Ukupno, korisnici imaju na raspolaganju šest mogućih ”težina” igre u okviru kojih pogađaju glasove na više od 200 odabranih riječi. Uz svaku zadanu riječ korisnicima se prikazuje sličica koja predstavlja pojam koji odgovara zadanoj riječi. Omogućeno je i izgovaranje cijele riječi kao i slovkanje riječi glas po glas."

As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

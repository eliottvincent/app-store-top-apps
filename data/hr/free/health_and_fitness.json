      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Benefit from the most popular, healthy, and effective weight-loss method, trusted by hundreds of millions adopters worldwide!\n\nPerfect for establishing a basic eating discipline, Simple is ideal for keeping yourself in good shape during self-isolation, with our educational and motivational content on staying mindful about your eating habits.\n\nPopularized by celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé, intermittent fasting is the most ancient eating pattern known to humans. It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

Add important events related to your sex life. Add notes to remember such things as symptoms and mood changes. You can use this app as your personal journal.\n\nMy Cycle is made specially for women like you.\nIf you have any questions or requests, please write to neumandev@gmail.com.

      "label": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\r\n\r\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "Virtuagym Food: Helping you to live healthy and feel great. Get a free personalized nutrition plan by answering a few questions about your lifestyle and goals. We support plans for many goals: weight loss, maintaining weight, weight gain and building muscle. Eat what you want, but keep an eye on those calories, carbs and fats!\n\nFEATURES\n* Food Database Validated by Expert Nutritionists\n* Add your own foods\n* Save meals and add them instantly next time\n* Nutrition tracking for several goals (e.g. weight loss & muscle building)\n* More than a calorie counter: keep an eye on those carbs, proteins and fats as well\n* Integrated with Virtuagym Fitness for home & gym workouts\n* Health app integration: Sync workouts from other apps, and save your eaten calories, carbs, proteins and fat in the Health app, so other apps can use this data\n\nWHY VIRTUAGYM IS THE BEST\n- Many other nutrition apps or calorie counters don’t have a lot of knowledge about fitness. Therefore, mistakes are being made with calorie tracking. Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises. If you have any suggestions, let us know. If you want to stay updated, get useful fitness tips or if you need motivation: follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPRO SUBSCRIPTION\nTo unlock the full app you can subscribe to our PRO membership. The monthly subscription will automatically renew and your iTunes account will be charged within 24 hours prior to renewal for the same amount as your current monthly subscription fee, if the auto-renew option is not turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.

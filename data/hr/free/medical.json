The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen.

For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

      "label": "The Melanoma Test is a complex and precise risk calculator for developing skin cancer. Using a combination of multiple test algorithms, we developed the test, which consider a wide range of factors and is able to recognize smaller nuances than any other risk calculator. After completing a brief questionnaire with pictures, you would learn whether you have any suspicious pigment mark on your skin or whether there is a potential risk of melanoma. This user-friendly application excels in its simplicity of use and is a great aid in preventing this disease. \n\nAbout 30-50 % of melanomas develop from a pigment mark. Melanoma is a malignant tumour of melanocytes which mostly develops on the skin. It is one of the less frequent types of skin cancer, but causes the highest number of deaths from these tumour diseases.\n\nIn most cases, the health symptoms are initial transformation of a static pigment mark, the early removal of which often prevents development of a malignant tumour.\n \nGet a test of your risk of developing melanoma thanks to this mobile application, since prevention is one of the most effective weapons against this disease. There is nothing simpler than to get examined by a dermatologist in case of any suspicion, rule out the risk of cancer, and be sure you are healthy.  Take advantage of modern trends in medicine and test yourself.\n \n The Melanoma Test application offers the following:\n●\t Melanoma development risk test\n●\t Disease information\n●\t Option to send test results via e-mail\n●\t Next test date reminder \n●\t Tips and tricks to reduce the risk of the disease\n● \tSharing option"

It will work without an external microphone but please be-aware that results may vary as the voice pitch analysis requires a relatively quiet environment and some phone microphones can pickup a lot of background noise.  \n\nThis tool is designed to act as a voice recorder/playback/analyser tool but with useful information such as voice pitch, tones, & volume with resonance and phonetics to be added at a later date. It is mostly intended for use as part of voice therapy, and users should be aiming to use the tool for about 5 minutes a day over several months.  It does not provide lessons or guidance, it is intended to be used as a tool to assist with voice therapy and not as a replacement for voice therapy.\n\n=Privacy=\nNo voice recordings are saved or leave the device.\n\n=Free=\nThis app is available in two flavors; a free advert supported version, and a paid advert-free version.  You can remove the adverts via an in-app purchase in the settings screen.\n\n=Bugs=\nHelp us to improve this app, if it doesn't work, or you have any ideas to help us improve please drop us an email so that we can improve things in the next release!"

Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

It is a number associated with a particular type of food to indicate the food's effect on a person's blood glucose (blood sugar) level. The number typically ranges between 50 and 100, where 100 represents pure glucose, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.\n\nThe Glycemic Load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's blood glucose level after eating it. It can be used to apply the Glycemic Index to dieting by connecting the GI number with carbohydrates content in a given serving. It gives an estimation on how much a serving size of food is likely to increase blood-sugar levels.\n\nNet carbs are total carbs minus fiber which is indigestible thus it is considered not to raise blood sugar levels.\n\nDiabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.\n\nHyperglycemia (also spelled hyperglycaemia or hyperglycæmia), is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma.\n\nObservational studies demonstrate that people who maintain arterial pressures at the low end of these pressure ranges have much better long-term cardiovascular health.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.creamsoft.com/en/terms-of-use-and-privacy-policy/"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

Great Job!\" - [5 stars]\n\n+ \"Well, I simply love this app! Very useful in radiology practice. Awesome photos and drawings! Can't wait for new updates! Just buy it!!!!\"  - [5 stars]\n\n+ \"Great app, with great content, well worth the few bucks! Support was excellent, my email was answered within a day. Keep it up!\"  - [5 stars]\n\n\n\n▸▸  KEY FEATURES\n\nThe app uses offline content with a layout that is optimized for your device's screen.\n\nWhen new content becomes available it can be directly downloaded to your device: No need to update the whole application from the App Store.\n\nFull text searching of all articles, both across all categories, and per category. Continues your full text search within the article.\n\nHi-res versions of article images, as well as image-stacks, can be viewed fullscreen, without leaving your place in the article; even when offline!\n\n\n▸▸  BACKGROUND\n\nThe Radiology Assistant 1.0 was released almost 7 years ago. It quickly became one of the most downloaded radiology apps, and consistently stayed in the Top Medical Apps section in numerous countries for all those years.\n\nWe have spent over a year completely rewriting the app, from the ground up. Radiology Assistant 2.0 provides a cleaner, faster and more efficient reading experience for all modern iOS devices. \n\nFor the technically interested: formerly Objective-C, the app is now 100% Swift\n\nBefore winning the \"Best Radiology Mobile App\" Award in 2018, the \"Radiology Assistant\" was a Minnies 2013 Finalist - Best Radiology Mobile App, nominated together with OsiriX HD! And again in 2017!\n- AuntMinnie.com\n\n\n\n▸▸  PRICING\n\nInstead of paying up front as for the Radiology Assistant 1.0, this new 2.0 app is a free download, and you can take a subscription to those Article Categories that you need. If you purchase all Categories you pay the same as RA1.0. If you need less Categories, you pay less.\n\n\n\n▸▸  ABOUT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION\n\n+ All subscription options are for the duration of one year and can be cancelled at any time.\n+ Each subscription option gives you unlimited access to all Articles in one or more Categories.\n+ When you select a subscription option you can still cancel the purchase. If you confirm, the payment will be charged to your iTunes Account, just like any other App Store purchase.\n+ Your subscription automatically renews. If this is not what you want, simply turn off auto-renew. You can do this at any time - but at least 24-hours before the end of the current period - by tapping the ‘Manage Subscription’ inside the app, or via your iTunes Account Settings. If you do not cancel, your iTunes Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\n+ If you are a Radiology Assistant 1.0 user, cancelling your subscription will forfeit any unused portion of the offered free period.\n+ You can upgrade to an option giving access to more or all Categories at any time. If you upgrade before your current subscription is over, you will be refunded the unused portion of your current subscription.\n+ You can find our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy on the in-app About page, as well as on our website, at https://doRadiology.com/RA2Legal.pdf."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "Blood pressure monitor & heart rate tracker app - Our application does not measure blood pressure. The app allows you to track it. For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "SKIN CHECKING & TELEHEALTH\n* World’s leading dermatology app for tracking skin changes, moles, skin care and asynchronous teledermatology (Telehealth in dermatology)\n* Dermatologically Endorsed by the Skin Health Alliance\n* App Store App of the Day on World Cancer Day\n* Partner to leading skin health organisations in the US, Canada, UK and South Africa.\n* Recommended by doctors to their patients in over 130 clinics/hospitals worldwide\n* Mentioned by Forbes, USAToday, CNET, Lifehacker, Digital Health News, MobiHealthNews and many more.\n\nMIISKIN APP FEATURES\nSome features are exclusively part of Miiskin Premium or Premium Light - Miiskin offers solutions for healthcare providers in the US to offer the full app for free for patients including telehealth. Ask your healthcare provider to hear more about Miiskin PRO.\n\n* PHOTOS AND TELEHEALTH with anyone you like. Ask your doctor and healthcare provider about your usage of the app and if they can receive photos for telehealth consultations or triage. Always follow your doctor’s instructions.\n\n* CLOSE-UP PHOTOGRAPHY used for tracking changes in single moles and other local areas on the skin. Miiskin has carefully calibrated the camera for the best possible close-up photography. Log the location on a body chart / map.\n\n* IN-APP COMPARISON allows you to get a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW of your photos so you can more easily compare them for changes over time.\n\n* AUTOMATIC SKIN IMAGING using computer vision and augmented reality technology makes the app capable of taking FULL-BODY IMAGES of you. All you need to do is to place the phone upright on a table with the camera facing the room and it does the rest. Currently available for iPhone XR, XS, 11, 11Pro and SE 2020.\n\n* MOLE SIZING helps you measure your moles and lesions over time. Simply add a coin into your close-up photos.\n\n* FACE TRACKING lets you take selfies from multiple-angles in seconds to track e.g. acne or skincare results\n\n* WEB COMPARE allows you to access your Miiskin App photos in the browser on any tablet or computer with a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW. Very useful for you to compare your full-body images for any changes on a larger screen.\n\n* SECURITY AND PRIVACY is a big priority for us. Miiskin separates your photos from your normal camera roll and encrypts them so no other apps can access them. You can protect them even more with a PIN-code or your Face/Touch ID and BLUR OUT areas of your full-body photos that you wish to stay private even if you share your photos.\n\nMIISKIN DOES NOT PROVIDE A DIAGNOSIS\nThe app does not diagnose your moles or evaluate the risk of melanoma, skin cancer or any other conditions. The app assists you with tracking skin and moles over time with a photo diary. We do not think that with today’s technology, and the present quality of smartphone images, that it is possible to provide AI diagnoses of melanoma or skin cancer risk. Therefore, we opt not to attempt to do that.\n\nIf you find a mole or mark that looks concerning you should always consult a certified doctor.\n\nTHE VISION OF MIISKIN\nMiiskin’s vision is to help you keep track of skin changes and skin conditions in the most user-friendly way possible.\n\nMIISKIN PREMIUM\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently.

Zaradi različnih vzrokov ljudje prve pomoči v nesreči pogosto ne nudijo, kar ima za posledico večje zdravstvene zaplete pri poškodovanih ali obolelih osebah. Rezultati mnogih raziskav kažejo, da je problem povezan predvsem s pomanjkanjem znanja o pravilnem nudenju prve pomoči. Po drugi strani pa ustrezna prva pomoč dokazano zmanjšuje število in trajanje hospitalizacij, prispeva k učinkovitejšemu zdravljenju, boljšemu okrevanju, večji kakovosti življenja po poškodbi ali obolenju, ter tako dolgoročno pozitivno vpliva na zdravstveno blagajno, zmanjšuje okoljsko obremenjenost in povečuje splošno blaginjo prebivalstva.\r\n\r\nMobilna aplikacija Prva pomoč pokriva dva usklajena sklopa izobraževalno-informacijskih vsebin:\r\n• Pomoč uporabnikom za učinkovito nudenje prve pomoči v primeru nastanka poškodb in najpogostejših nenadnih obolenj.\r\n• Povečanje ravni znanja prve pomoči med splošno populacijo (pridobivanje doktrinarno ustreznih napotkov za nudenje prve pomoči, ocenjevanje znanja, obnavljanje/utrjevanje znanja, spodbujanje učenja prve pomoči, zmanjševanje predsodkov pred nudenjem prve pomoči, spodbujanje solidarnosti in zavedanja pomena pomoči sočloveku v stiski).\r\n\r\nStrokovne vsebine aplikacije temeljijo na smernicah Evropskega referenčnega centra za prvo pomoč ter Strokovnega centra za prvo pomoč Rdečega križa Slovenije. Gre za besedilni, slikovni in video prikaz temeljnih vsebin in napotkov za prvo pomoč, namenjenih tako splošni javnosti kot tudi različnim skupinam in organizacijam (šolam, delovnim organizacijam, društvom, ekipam prve pomoči …).\r\n\r\nV sklopu razvoja aplikacije smo strokovno vsebino razvili skupaj z Rdečim Križem Slovenije, Univerzitetnim kliničnim centrom (UKC) Ljubljana, Univerzo v Ljubljani - Zdravstveno fakulteto  in Univerzo v Mariboru - Fakulteto za organizacijske vede - Laboratorijem za ergonomijo."

Or to gain confidence before performing a procedure you perform less commonly?\n \nThe Dechra Dog & Cat Anaesthesia app is a unique resource designed to put practical, accessible information into the hands of veterinarians, veterinary nurses/technicians and vet students. Developed with specialist veterinary anaesthetists and approved by the Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists (AVA), the app contains suggested anaesthetic protocols for 24 procedures in the dog and 15 in the cat. It is like having a veterinary anaesthetist in your pocket!\n \nEach procedure contains up to date, detailed anaesthetic considerations for the patient including pre-op stabilisation where required, appropriate premedication options, peri-operative analgesia and details about induction, maintenance, monitoring, and recovery. This allows you to choose the most appropriate protocol for every unique patient.\nThe app also contains information about 36 of the most commonly used molecules in dog and cat anaesthesia, allowing you to confidently choose and use the most appropriate molecule for every situation. A suggested dosage and route of administration is given, alongside information about indication, time to onset and duration of action, contraindications and side effects.\nThe app includes an easy to use dose calculator so that you can quickly calculate the doses required for your patient and also allows you to design your own protocols. Each completed protocol can be saved into your favourites folder to use again, or you can email the protocol summary to be saved in the patient’s clinical records, or to be printed.\n\nDechra are advocates of patient safety and are keen to promote best practice anaesthesia. As part of this commitment we have included the AVA Anaesthetic Safety Checklist within the app. The Dechra Dog and Cat Anaesthesia App reinforces Dechra as leaders in veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia and provides unprecedented technical support to veterinary professionals."

It operates by using the machine learning model trained on clinical cases.\n\nYou must follow three main steps to obtain results:\n\n1. Measure all the blood parameters from our Mandatory Blood parameter List at your nearest laboratory.\n2. Enter and submit the blood test results in the app.\n3. Receive your mySmartBlood report including the list of most likely groups of diseases and explanations of blood parameters contributing to the results.\n\nBenefit & Risks:\n\nmySmartBlood is a priceless tool to guide you to the right healthcare professional and can significantly shorten your path to the final diagnosis, which is often associated with expensive diagnostic procedures. That way, the mySmartBlood enables your healthcare professional to make faster and more accurate diagnostic decisions and consequently improves your treatment and reduces your costs of the treatment.\n\nBy its inherent design, mySmartBlood does not provide information that could itself be used to confirm or discard health condition, since it always provides a list of max. 5 likely groups of diseases. By providing information in such a format, it enables the healthcare professional to naturally consider multiple options. The interpretation provided by mySmartBlood is only an information to guide you to consult the appropriate healthcare professional.\n\nmySmartBlood is intended to be used for interpreting blood results of Caucasian adult users (older than 18 years old), both female (non-pregnant) and male, with acute and/or chronic conditions in the following fields of internal medicine (Toxicology, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Hematology, Nephrology, Pulmonology, Rheumatology).\n\nmySmartBlood is contraindicated for use in: \n\n•\tusers below the age of 18,\n•\temergency situations in general, e.g.:\n        •.signs of a heart attack (severe/heavy/crushing chest pain…),\n        • signs of a stroke (facial weakness, slurred speech, inability to hold both arms up…),\n        • severe breathing problems,\n        • any other untoward sign or symptom that may be of urgent nature or necessitate urgent or emergency care,\n•\tpregnancy.\n\nAdditional Information and Warnings: \n\n•\tmySmartBlood is not a diagnostic medical device and you are not allowed and you should not make any decisions based only on the results obtained by mySmartBlood, without consulting a healthcare professional.\n•\tYour diagnosis shall always be determined by the responsible physician based on all available physical findings, patients’ anamneses, symptoms and results of other diagnostic tests.\n•\tCertain kinds of medication therapy can affect mySmartBlood outputs. When consulting with a healthcare professional, please inform them regarding this. \n•\tmySmartBlood can only be used if all parameters from the Mandatory Blood Parameter List are available and the input of the blood parameters and values are correct.\n•\tmySmartBlood can only predict the groups of diseases that are available in its database. All the available groups of diseases are listed in the Instructions For Use, Annex II.\n•\tYou should use mySmartBlood if you are showing any kind of medical symptoms. mySmartBlood is not designed for screening purposes.\n•\tPlease note that obtainment of the mandatory blood parameter list measurement might be subject to additional costs by your healthcare provider or local laboratory. \n•\tmySmartBlood report is subject to payment of a one-time fee to the amount of CHF 29 per individual report.

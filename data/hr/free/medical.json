The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Most cases of back pain get better on their own within a few weeks.\n\nStay active. Bed rest for more than a couple of days makes it harder to get going. Gradually increase your normal activities and do regular exercise.\n\nWhen done in a controlled, progressive manner, exercises for relieving back pain have many benefits, including:\n- Strengthening the muscles that support the spine, removing pressure from the spinal discs and facet joints\n- Alleviating stiffness and improving mobility\n- Improving circulation to better distribute nutrients through the body, including to the spinal discs\n- Releasing endorphins, which can naturally relieve pain. A frequent release of endorphins can help reduce reliance on pain medication. -\n Endorphins can also elevate mood and relieve depressive symptoms, a common effect of chronic pain.\n- Minimizing the frequency of back or neck pain episodes, and reducing the severity of pain when it does occur\n\nYour core muscles support your spine and lower back, and your core, hips, glutes, and hamstrings together form one big stability machine, so weakness in any one of those muscles forces the others to take up the slack. If you have weak hip and gluteal muscles, for example, as they become fatigued during a run, your lower back is forced to work harder to keep you upright and stable, and you become vulnerable to injury."

For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

      "label": "Erby helps you easily track and record breastfeeding, newborn activity, sleep statistics. It's also a handy food diary for your baby and nursing mom!\n\nYou will be able to make sure that the newborn is getting enough breast milk and to establish the daily baby care. Enter information about food, beverages, medications and supplements you are taking. This will help identify allergic reactions in the infant.\n\nLACTATION\n\nStart the breastfeeding timer with one click! Track the duration of feedings, easily remember which breast you fed the last time: this will help to establish breastfeeding and avoid lactostasis. Record data on pumping and responses to the first complementary foods.\n\nPUMPING\n\nConsider the volume of expressed milk with the option to start the feeding timer separately for each breast or both at the same time.\nKeep records of frozen milk - make sure you have enough stocks in your milk stash\n\nSLEEP\n\nUse a sleep tracker and note down when your child is asleep and awake. Record night and day sleep to understand baby's sleep and wake patterns\n\nDIAPERS\n\nSchedule your diaper change so you know how many diapers you need. Write urination (with volume as needed) and bowel movements separately\n\nHEALTH, FEEDING\n\nMark various symptoms and temperature, enter data on vitamins,  medicines and vaccination. \nRecord complementary feeding data and track the baby's response. Monitor your baby's weight gain and growth. Watch for teething. Erby is great for visiting a pediatrician.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nRecord bathing and walking, tummy time, games, massage. \n\nSTATISTICS AND HISTORY\n\nView event statistics so you can spot trends and, if necessary, make adjustments to your baby's care. Study your daily routine. A complete history of events, the ability to filter them by type (for example, only walks or pump log) is always at your fingertips.\n\nREMINDERS\n\nSet reminders for the events you need. You will not miss your medication and will not forget to feed or put your child to bed at the right time.\n\nErby is not just a baby development journal, it is a memory of your precious first months with him.\n\nYou can keep a diary for multiple children. Suitable for twins!\n\nOur breast feeding app was created to help even the most sleep-deprived parents keep track of their baby's progress up to one year old by recording daily activities and feeding statistics in this easy-to-use diary.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/erby/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/erby/ios/\n\n\nWe are always glad to receive your questions, suggestions and comments.

      "label": "Experience with us the fascination of newly emerged life. Watch wonderful ultrasound videos of babies in different weeks of pregnancy. If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

Ask your healthcare provider to hear more about Miiskin PRO.\n\n* PHOTOS AND TELEHEALTH with anyone you like. Ask your doctor and healthcare provider about your usage of the app and if they can receive photos for telehealth consultations or triage. Always follow your doctor’s instructions.\n\n* CLOSE-UP PHOTOGRAPHY used for tracking changes in single moles and other local areas on the skin. Miiskin has carefully calibrated the camera for the best possible close-up photography. Log the location on a body chart / map.\n\n* IN-APP COMPARISON allows you to get a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW of your photos so you can more easily compare them for changes over time.\n\n* AUTOMATIC SKIN IMAGING using computer vision and augmented reality technology makes the app capable of taking FULL-BODY IMAGES of you. All you need to do is to place the phone upright on a table with the camera facing the room and it does the rest. Currently available for iPhone XR, XS, 11, 11Pro and SE 2020.\n\n* MOLE SIZING helps you measure your moles and lesions over time. Simply add a coin into your close-up photos.\n\n* FACE TRACKING lets you take selfies from multiple-angles in seconds to track e.g. acne or skincare results\n\n* WEB COMPARE allows you to access your Miiskin App photos in the browser on any tablet or computer with a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW. Very useful for you to compare your full-body images for any changes on a larger screen.\n\n* SECURITY AND PRIVACY is a big priority for us. Miiskin separates your photos from your normal camera roll and encrypts them so no other apps can access them. You can protect them even more with a PIN-code or your Face/Touch ID and BLUR OUT areas of your full-body photos that you wish to stay private even if you share your photos.\n\nMIISKIN DOES NOT PROVIDE A DIAGNOSIS\nThe app does not diagnose your moles or evaluate the risk of melanoma, skin cancer or any other conditions. The app assists you with tracking skin and moles over time with a photo diary. We do not think that with today’s technology, and the present quality of smartphone images, that it is possible to provide AI diagnoses of melanoma or skin cancer risk. Therefore, we opt not to attempt to do that.\n\nIf you find a mole or mark that looks concerning you should always consult a certified doctor.\n\nTHE VISION OF MIISKIN\nMiiskin’s vision is to help you keep track of skin changes and skin conditions in the most user-friendly way possible.\n\nMIISKIN PREMIUM\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

      "label": "PotBot simplifies the lives of medical marijuana patients who do not know which strain will be best for their condition. Backed by science, PotBot’s unique cannabinoid-based algorithm uses the latest peer-reviewed research to recommend strains in the local area that have the best chance of relieving a patient’s symptoms. \n\n\"Using cutting-edge technology, PotBotics is changing how the medical marijuana industry treats patients.\" - Fortune\n\n\"While others are looking to make marijuana stronger, PotBotics is looking to make it smarter.\" - Newsweek\n\nWhy PotBot? \n1. Personalize Your Treatment \nPotBot provides recommendations tailored to each patient's individual needs, as opposed to a “one-size-fits-all approach.” PotBot is the only service that recommends optimal cannabinoid levels, medical cannabis strains, and consumption methods for a patient’s specific ailment based off of their previous experience with cannabis. \n\n2. Ensure Safety \nThere are more than 750 strains of cannabis to choose from and dozens of consumption methods available, such as tinctures, concentrates, edibles, topicals, vaporizers, and sprays. Choosing the wrong strain and form of ingestion can aggravate symptoms instead of alleviating them. Protect yourself from misuse by adding an additional layer of security and legitimacy to your medical cannabis recommendation. \n\n3. Save Money\nFor new and returning patients, the medical cannabis buying decision process can be particularly frustrating, forcing them to experiment with different strains in an expensive trial and error process. With a personalized medical marijuana recommendation from PotBot, patients can avoid spending money on cannabis products that don’t offer the best possible relief. \n\n4. Save Time\nPatients no longer have to spend countless, hours, days, and sometimes weeks doing the research needed to educate themselves on the medicinal benefits of cannabis. PotBot makes life simple by aggregating all existing medical research into a seamless recommendation process that takes minutes to complete.\n\n5. Instill Confidence \nWhat is usually a stressful process for beginner medical marijuana patients is now a fast and intuitive experience. Patients can be confident knowing that PotBot’s 3rd party recommendations are science-based and not influenced by a dispensary’s sales agenda."

      "label": "Snore Doctor is a brand new app by Dr Vik Veer, who is a world renowned Snoring & Sleep Apnoea surgeon. The app is completely free to use, with no restrictions (there are affiliate links to products where if you decided to buy them a small commission would go to supporting the cost of the app – there would be no cost to you). Snore Doctor is in an experimental phase at the moment, and I would appreciate your help in improving it for my patients.\n\nThis app allows you to record your snoring at night and see the results in the morning.  There is a graph to show you how loud you are, and this is measured in decibels so you can compare it to real life sounds (e.g I snore as loud as a vacuum cleaner or a hand drill etc.).\nYou can also see your average snoring levels over several days or weeks so you can get a better idea of how loud you snore over a long period of time. This is therefore superior to a sleep study in terms of snoring data as they only record noise data from one or two nights at most. People snore at variable levels throughout the week, and getting an average level over a long period of time is very important to understand snoring trends.  It would also help you understand if losing weight, using a device or surgery helped your snoring levels.\nSnore Doctor will also record your snoring so you can hear it back and show it to your friends, family, or doctor later on. You also have the option of sharing your data via social media / email if you wish.\nThe app is easy to use, just place your phone next to your bed (in the same position every night to keep the data consistent), and then press record.  For accuracy the app will calibrate itself by measuring the background noise level first (some people live in noisy built up city areas which can affect your results), and then it will start recording your breathing and snoring. The snoring is then measured above the calibrated background noise level.\nEach night can be tagged so you can see later if alcohol, stress, a mandibular advancement device etc, really does affect your snoring levels over multiple nights."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "The simplest program to track breastfeeding, pumping, bottle feeding, solid food consumption, diapers, sleep schedule, height and weight, and more.\n\nWith the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.\n\nThe birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

      "label": "Health2Sync was selected by Healthline as one of the \"Best Diabetes Apps of 2019\". \n\nHealth2Sync helps you combat diabetes by making blood sugar tracking more meaningful.  You can easily log your blood sugar, blood pressure, weight, medication, diet, exercise, and mood through the app.  Health2Sync provides you helpful feedback based on your blood sugar records to help you manage diabetes.  \n\nKey features of Health2Sync:\n\n-- Blood glucose tracking --\nManually entering your blood glucose records is fast and intuitive with Health2Sync.  Along with your blood glucose readings, you can enter notes, select medication you used, food you’ve consumed, and attach photos.  Alternatively, you can also purchase the Health2Sync Smart Cable, which will allow you to upload readings in bulk from your glucose meter.\n\n-- Blood pressure tracking --\nYou can track your blood pressure readings as well with Health2Sync.  Enter your systolic, diastolic, and pulse readings and easily see how you've been progressing with blood pressure control.\n\n-- Weight tracking --\nWe know how important weight control is for Type 2 Diabetes, so you can also keep track of weight changes with Health2Sync.  You can enter your weight and body fat, set goals, and easily see what progress you've made.\n\n-- Dashboard --\nEvery time you open the app, you will immediately see a dashboard that gives you a quick analysis of your recent blood glucose history in table and graph formats.  You can see whether your readings are in range, the movement of your readings, and you can even chart differences between your before-meal and after-meal readings.  \n\n-- Diary --\nDiary allows you to easily review your past blood sugar records.  You can quickly see what factors contributed to a high or low reading.  You can also view the diary in a table format to quickly compare before-meal and after-meal readings.  \n\n-- Partners --\nWe know having diabetes can make you feel lonely sometimes.  You can invite your loved ones to become partners with you on Health2Sync.  As your partner, not only can they stay on top of your blood glucose changes, they can also provide you with warm encouragements to keep you going.\n\n-- Sync with Health App --\nHealth2Sync also gives you the option to integrate with your phone's built-in Health App.  Just grant the appropriate permissions, then data such as your blood glucose, blood pressure and weight readings can be automatically synced with Health.  You can also import existing data in Health directly into Health2Sync, which makes it much faster for you to get started.  \n\n-- Data Export --\nThe data you enter in the app can be exported as a PDF report or Excel file.  You can e-mail this data to your doctor directly from the app, or mail it to yourself and print it out prior to your next visit.\n\n-- A1C tracking --\nA1C gives you a long-term indicator of blood glucose control.  You can also keep track of your A1C history and view your trends with the Health2Sync App.\n\nWe know that testing blood glucose can be painful and tiring sometimes, we really hope Health2Sync can make diabetes management more meaningful to you.  For more information about our app and Smart Cable, please go to our website at https://www.health2sync.com.\n\n-- Jurisdiction Statement --\nNot all devices listed in the Health2Sync app may be available in your country. Find whether your device has regulatory clearance on our website: https://www.health2sync.com/device_list_pdfs/device_availability.pdf\n\nAlways check with the regulatory authority and/or the device manufacturer for confirmation before connecting your device with the Health2Sync app."

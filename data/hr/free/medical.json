The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "Join the millions of medical professionals who use MDCalc daily to support clinical decision making at the bedside. Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "The simplest program to track breastfeeding, pumping, bottle feeding, solid food consumption, diapers, sleep schedule, height and weight, and more.\n\nWith the click of a button, your feedings and baby care history will be stored in the app. You will have an easy-to-maintain history of your baby’s growth.\n\nThe birth of a baby is a miracle that fills your heart with joy! A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

Wrong picks will buzz your iPhone / iPad and give you a minus score. \n\n[Note] \n1) All cases are stored in raw data (sample rate is 500 points per second), not static images, so you can look into very detailed waves in pixels \n2) You should already have basic knowledge of ECG interpretation, and you use the cases to build a solid cardiology foundation \n\n[Findings Covered] \nAtrial Flutter \nAtrial Fibrillation \nVentricular Fibrillation \nEscape Beat \nPAC (Premature Atrial Contruction) \nPAC Bigeminy \nPAC Trigeminy \nPVC (Premature Ventricular Contruction) \nPVC Bigeminy \nPVC Trigeminy \nSupraventricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Escape Rhythm \nVentricular Rhythm \nQT Prolongation \nShort QT \nHigh T \nST Elevation \nS1,S2,S3 Pattern \nHigh Voltage \nPositive T in V1 \nVentricular Hypertrophy \nLVH \nLeft / Right Atrial Enlargement \nLeft Ventricular Hypertrophy \nLeft Atrial Overload \nShort PR Interval \nWPW Syndrome \nSuspect WPW Syndrome \nAV Block I (Wenckebach / Mobitz) \n2:1 AV Block \nComplete AV Block \nArtificial Pacemaker Rhythm(A / V / D) \nRSR' Pattern \nIRBBB (Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block) \nIVCD (Intraventricular Conduction Block) \nCRBBB (Complete Right Bundle Branch Block) \nCLBBB (Complete Left Bundle Branch Block) \nICLBBB (Incomplete Left Bundle Branch Block) \nLAH (Left Anterior Hemi Block) \nLPH (Left Posterior Hemi Block) \nBBBB (Bifascicular Bundle Block) \nTBBB (Trifascicular Bundle Block) \nFlat T \nNegative T \nST-T Abnormality \nPremature repolarization Syndrome \nPoor R Progression \nAbnormal Q wave \nSubendcardial Infarction \nPossible Anterior Infarction \nAnterior Infarction \nAnteroseptal Infarction \nPossible Lateral Infarction \nLateral Infarction \nInferior Infarction \nPossible High-Post Infarction \nSinus Rhythm \nCoronary Sinus Rhythm \nAV Junctional Rhythm \nAV Dissociation \nMarked Sinus Bradycardia \nSinus Bradycardia \nSinus Tachycardia \nTachycardia \nBradycardia \nExtreme Tachycardia \nExtreme Bradycardia \nSinus Arrhythmia"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

It is a number associated with a particular type of food to indicate the food's effect on a person's blood glucose (blood sugar) level. The number typically ranges between 50 and 100, where 100 represents pure glucose, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.\n\nThe Glycemic Load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's blood glucose level after eating it. It can be used to apply the Glycemic Index to dieting by connecting the GI number with carbohydrates content in a given serving. It gives an estimation on how much a serving size of food is likely to increase blood-sugar levels.\n\nNet carbs are total carbs minus fiber which is indigestible thus it is considered not to raise blood sugar levels.\n\nDiabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.\n\nHyperglycemia (also spelled hyperglycaemia or hyperglycæmia), is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma.\n\nObservational studies demonstrate that people who maintain arterial pressures at the low end of these pressure ranges have much better long-term cardiovascular health.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.creamsoft.com/en/terms-of-use-and-privacy-policy/"

      "label": "The right kinds of lower back exercises will help recovery from back pain.\n\nBack pain is common but most cases aren’t caused by a serious problem. Most cases of back pain get better on their own within a few weeks.\n\nStay active. Bed rest for more than a couple of days makes it harder to get going. Gradually increase your normal activities and do regular exercise.\n\nWhen done in a controlled, progressive manner, exercises for relieving back pain have many benefits, including:\n- Strengthening the muscles that support the spine, removing pressure from the spinal discs and facet joints\n- Alleviating stiffness and improving mobility\n- Improving circulation to better distribute nutrients through the body, including to the spinal discs\n- Releasing endorphins, which can naturally relieve pain. A frequent release of endorphins can help reduce reliance on pain medication. -\n Endorphins can also elevate mood and relieve depressive symptoms, a common effect of chronic pain.\n- Minimizing the frequency of back or neck pain episodes, and reducing the severity of pain when it does occur\n\nYour core muscles support your spine and lower back, and your core, hips, glutes, and hamstrings together form one big stability machine, so weakness in any one of those muscles forces the others to take up the slack. If you have weak hip and gluteal muscles, for example, as they become fatigued during a run, your lower back is forced to work harder to keep you upright and stable, and you become vulnerable to injury."

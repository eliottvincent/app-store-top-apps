      "label": "Preverite, kaj je na poti z ažurnimi, točnimi, jasnimi in dostopnimi prometnimi informacijami. Pravi prijatelj za poti brez skrbi!\n \nAMZS je brezplačna aplikacija, ki voznike opozarja na radarje, nasproti vozeče voznike, policijske kontrole, prometne nesreče, zastoje, bližine šol in druge dogodke v prometu. Barvna skala cest ponazarja pretočnost prometa. Deluje tako, da ženski glas voznika v slovenskem jeziku samodejno opozori na dogodek, ki voznika čaka na njegovi poti. Pri tem vozniku ni potrebno gledati v telefon, temveč lahko ostane osredotočen na vožnjo in cesto.\nPoleg obveščanja o dogodkih, vsebuje tudi vpogled v cestne  kamer. Vpogled v cestne kamere omogoča vozniku, da pregleda stanje na slovenskem avtocestnem križu, preden se odpravi na pot.\n \nAplikacija ima tudi tipko SOS. Tipka SOS pošlje sms s koordinatami vozila v klicni center AMZS. Sporočilo omogoča dežurni ekipi AMZS, da obvesti ustrezne intervencijske službe.\nTipka SOS igra zelo pomembno vlogo v primeru, ko udeleženec zaradi šoka ne zna točno opisati svoje lokacije. Tipka SOS zato uporabniku omogoča, da na enostaven način\nz enim SMS sporočilom posreduje svojo točno lokacijo in tako zelo olajša delo intervencijskim službam.\n \nZa točnost prometnih informacij skrbi posebej usposobljena ekipa prometnega servisa Radia 1 in informacijskega centra AMZS, vsak dan, od 6h do 24h.\n \n \n* Pogosta uporaba GPS-a v ozadju lahko hitreje izprazni baterijo.\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

The navigation and other functionalities of the application will encourage inexperienced hikers, promote hiking and, last but not least, thanks to this healthy trend, smaller number of cars can be expected on Sljeme.  \r\n\r\nThe city of Zagreb is one of the few capitals in the world with ‘its own hill' in the immediate vicinity, and Moje Sljeme application is, among other things, an excellent tool for attracting foreign visitors. Although Zagreb has proven to be a tempting tourist destination, the application can certainly contribute to new records in visits. \r\n\r\nSpending time outside is very important for health, so this is one of the ways the City of Zagreb wishes to convey to its citizens a message about the importance of outdoor activities, in strict adherence to epidemiological measures. This, along with other things, helps maintain mental health, which is not to be neglected, as well as physical health. \r\n\r\nThe functionalities include: navigation, lists of trails, lodges and other destinations such as springs, caves and sacral heritage, descriptions, image gallery, weather forecast, etc.\r\n\r\nLink to terms of service:\r\nhttps://www.zagreb.hr/terms-of-service/171564\r\n\r\nLink to privacy policy: \r\nhttps://www.zagreb.hr/privacy-policy/171563"

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

Definitely this is the most precise way to define the boundaries of your land parcel so that you can use all features of this app.\r\nFor the purpose of this app, the land parcel is any land having its own boundaries defined by corners. Most often, the land parcel can be a cadastral parcel, but it can also be part of an agricultural plot where you have for example planted apples. The corner points are defined with GPS (WGS84) coordinates known as latitude and longitude.\r\nAlso the corner points can be defined in other coordinate reference system provided by your geoportal. You can read the coordinates from the corresponding geoportal map.\r\n\r\nApp Features:\r\nIdentification of land parcels, cadastral parcels.\r\nDisplay your land parcels on a map on your smartphone.\r\nView the distance between the smartphone and the land parcel.\r\nView your current smartphone location on the map.\r\nRead the current GPS coordinates.\r\nImproved accuracy of the current GPS coordinates reading.\r\nCreate a land parcel by entering the coordinates.\r\nUpdate the entered coordinates.\r\nDownload the cadastral parcel coordinates from our web server\r\nTransformation from reference coordinates to Gps (WGS84) coordinates\r\nCalculation of land plot area and boundary line lengths.\r\nSave the land parcel files in your local smartphone storage.\r\nLanguage support for English, German, Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, Serbian, Czech, Slovak, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, French.\r\nSupport for the coordinate systems and geoportals in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland and Europe.\r\nList of visible satellites\r\nSupport for GNSS and L1+L5\r\nRecord your current location data (coordinates, speed, time) while you walk or drive. The data is saved in a daily route file.\r\nDisplay the route on a map.\r\nCreate and display the parallel guidance lines used in precision agriculture."

Ziel der DRONIQ, einem Joint Venture der Deutschen Flugsicherung (DFS) und der Deutschen Telekom ist die sichere und faire Integration von Drohnen in den Luftraum. \n\nPlanung, Prüfung und Durchführung von Missionen\n\nDie kostenfreie App ist konform mit der neuen EU-Verordnung und berücksichtigt die damit einhergehenden Vorschriften und Anforderungen für den Drohnenflug. Sie richtet sich insbesondere an Hobby- und Freizeitpiloten und unterstützt sie entlang der gesamten Missionsplanung und der anschließenden Durchführung. Nach der Missionsspezifizierung durch den Piloten prüft die App die Mission in Echtzeit mit Blick auf die geltenden Luftraumverordnungen und -beschränkungen. Der Nutzer wird innerhalb weniger Minuten informiert, ob seine geplante Mission erlaubt ist. Die Frage „Wo darf ich fliegen“ wird durch die App somit schnell beantwortet. Bekommt der Nutzer ein negatives Ergebnis, kann er über die App im Detail prüfen, welche Vorgaben bei der aktuellen Missionsplanung noch nicht eingehalten werden und diese entsprechend anpassen. \n\n \n\nNeben luftraumrelevanten Daten zeigt interaktives Kartenmaterial die typische Infrastruktur, wie Krankenhäuser, Polizeistationen usw. an und warnt den Nutzer, wenn seine Distanz hierzu zu gering ist. Weitere Karteninformationen können benutzerdefiniert ein- und ausgeblendet werden. In der Logbuch-Funktion werden bereits durchgeführte Flüge übersichtlich dargestellt und können nachträglich bewertet und mit Details versehen werden. Weiterhin kann der Nutzer sein Profil anpassen und Drohnen hinzufügen bzw. bearbeiten."

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the same cost as your original purchase.\n\n\nTIPS FOR MAPPING ROUTES\n• For longer routes, try zooming in and mapping your route in multiple segments.\n• Tap and hold the map to quickly route between waypoints and POIs.\n• Did Footpath snap to the wrong roads? Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

      "label": "MiraTrex PRO CHARTS™ is a powerful, yet easy-to-use marine navigation system. Whether you’re a fisherman, weekend cruiser, sailor, diver, jet-skier, or an offshore captain needing to find an exact location hundreds of miles offshore, PRO CHARTS™ will get you there and back home safely – with nothing more than your iPhone or iPad.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n• High-resolution NOAA nautical chart coverage with depths for all U.S. coastal areas, the Great Lakes, major U.S. river systems, and Brazil plus global high-level nautical charts. Charts are automatically updated based on NOAA chart corrections.\n\n• Easy one-touch Waypoint and Route creation. Pre-plan your routes at home or create them at sea with equal ease. Just touch the screen to create new waypoints and routes.\n\n• Find your friends on the water. With our new Buddy-tracking feature, you can see and meet up with your friends while you’re out on the water. If you’re on your secret spot and don’t want to be seen, you can hide your location with the touch of a button.\n\n• Stay safe. Easily create and send a Float Plan of your trip to a friend or family member. Your Float Plan and location history can be forwarded to search and rescue personnel in case of an emergency.\n\n• Easy point-and-steer navigation. The red heading bug on the large on-screen compass always directs you to the next point on your route. Navigation is as easy as pointing your boat at the heading bug to stay on course.\n\n• No Network. No Problem. PRO CHARTS™ is designed so no internet connection is required to view your charts while out on the water. You simply download in advance any charts you’ll need at sea with the touch of a button.\n\n• Record your tracks. Track your position in real-time and later view your track history.\n\n• Fully indexed point of interest (POI) database including weather, aids to navigation (markers and lights), obstructions, tides, currents, your buddies, and more.\n\n\nWebsite: www.miratrex.com\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nPlans:\n\nBase app with limited features - Free \n14 day trial of all premium features - Free\nAll premium features (Monthly) - $2.99\nAll premium features (Annual) - $29.99 (Save 16%, about 2 months free)\n\n\n\n-Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n-Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n-You will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for that product.\n\n-You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the Apple Settings app after purchase.\n\n-No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period. This does not affect your statutory rights.\n\n-Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.\n\n-We will be collecting information about your use of the app both when you are online and offline.

Though PRO CHARTS™ will function without a GPS as a chart reader, a GPS-enabled device is required for point-to-point navigation. Third-party Bluetooth GPS units are available to enable GPS for iOS devices such as WiFi-only iPads that do not include a GPS receiver. For offline use where no Internet connection is available, charts must be pre-cached while still on-line and connected, any charts downloaded while online will be available for offline use."

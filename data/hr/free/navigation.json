      "label": "Preverite, kaj je na poti z ažurnimi, točnimi, jasnimi in dostopnimi prometnimi informacijami. Pravi prijatelj za poti brez skrbi!\n \nAMZS je brezplačna aplikacija, ki voznike opozarja na radarje, nasproti vozeče voznike, policijske kontrole, prometne nesreče, zastoje, bližine šol in druge dogodke v prometu. Barvna skala cest ponazarja pretočnost prometa. Deluje tako, da ženski glas voznika v slovenskem jeziku samodejno opozori na dogodek, ki voznika čaka na njegovi poti. Pri tem vozniku ni potrebno gledati v telefon, temveč lahko ostane osredotočen na vožnjo in cesto.\nPoleg obveščanja o dogodkih, vsebuje tudi vpogled v cestne  kamer. Vpogled v cestne kamere omogoča vozniku, da pregleda stanje na slovenskem avtocestnem križu, preden se odpravi na pot.\n \nAplikacija ima tudi tipko SOS. Tipka SOS pošlje sms s koordinatami vozila v klicni center AMZS. Sporočilo omogoča dežurni ekipi AMZS, da obvesti ustrezne intervencijske službe.\nTipka SOS igra zelo pomembno vlogo v primeru, ko udeleženec zaradi šoka ne zna točno opisati svoje lokacije. Tipka SOS zato uporabniku omogoča, da na enostaven način\nz enim SMS sporočilom posreduje svojo točno lokacijo in tako zelo olajša delo intervencijskim službam.\n \nZa točnost prometnih informacij skrbi posebej usposobljena ekipa prometnega servisa Radia 1 in informacijskega centra AMZS, vsak dan, od 6h do 24h.\n \n \n* Pogosta uporaba GPS-a v ozadju lahko hitreje izprazni baterijo.\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

In a lower left corner there is a button \"Location\" in the shape of a sniper icon. By clicking this button your detected location gets placed in the center of a map and its movement gets followed. \n\n                For every reported patrol you can click and receive information about the probability that there is a patrol indeed located there, as well as who reported it first and last. You can confirm every patrol if you have seen it as well or negate it if the patrol is no longer in a reported location. Your every vote is recorded and if you provide truthful information your reliability gets increased or decreased if you provide misleading information. You can also leave a comment for any chosen patrol. The more reliability you have the more your vote is worth.\n\n                Please drive carefully and respect traffic regulations!

The app enables safe hiking and exploring of the Medvednica Nature Park, the green pearl of Zagreb which many call Zagreb’s lungs. \r\n\r\nIn these times of the COVID-19 pandemic, building immunity has become very important, and a way to achieve it is precisely by being active and spending time outdoors. The navigation and other functionalities of the application will encourage inexperienced hikers, promote hiking and, last but not least, thanks to this healthy trend, smaller number of cars can be expected on Sljeme.  \r\n\r\nThe city of Zagreb is one of the few capitals in the world with ‘its own hill' in the immediate vicinity, and Moje Sljeme application is, among other things, an excellent tool for attracting foreign visitors. Although Zagreb has proven to be a tempting tourist destination, the application can certainly contribute to new records in visits. \r\n\r\nSpending time outside is very important for health, so this is one of the ways the City of Zagreb wishes to convey to its citizens a message about the importance of outdoor activities, in strict adherence to epidemiological measures. This, along with other things, helps maintain mental health, which is not to be neglected, as well as physical health. \r\n\r\nThe functionalities include: navigation, lists of trails, lodges and other destinations such as springs, caves and sacral heritage, descriptions, image gallery, weather forecast, etc.\r\n\r\nLink to terms of service:\r\nhttps://www.zagreb.hr/terms-of-service/171564\r\n\r\nLink to privacy policy: \r\nhttps://www.zagreb.hr/privacy-policy/171563"

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Whether you use your Garmin products for cruising, fishing, sailing or diving, this all-in-one app will help you enjoy your time on the water.\r\n\r\nJust pair the app with your compatible chartplotter to wirelessly transfer and access charts and maps, software updates, routes, waypoints and helpful feedback from the ActiveCaptain Community. And, with the purchase of the OnDeck™ hub(1), you can track and monitor your boat from virtually anywhere.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this app is intended for Garmin chartplotter owners and is not recommended for use as a stand-alone navigational app.\r\n\r\nFEATURES AVAILABLE:\r\n- ONECHART™:\r\n> New Garmin Navionics+™ and premium Garmin Navionics Vision+™ cartography, featuring a Navionics® style appearance, advanced Auto Guidance+™ technology(2) and a one-year subscription to daily updates, is available now for North America and Europe, and coming soon to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nPurchase our newest-generation charts or legacy BlueChart® g3 charts from your mobile device, and upload them to registered Garmin chartplotters on your vessel. \r\n\r\nYou will get exceptional coverage, clarity and detail with charts that feature integrated Garmin and Navionics data and much more. Plus, the NOAA raster cartography(3) and premium features can be downloaded for free through the ActiveCaptain app. Visit Garmin.com/marinemaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n- PLAN A TRIP: Plan your trip, or e-scout a new fishing spot before you’re on the water.

Check ratings, read reviews, and view pictures of POIs to make informed decisions on the water.

You can also upload your own Quickdraw Contours map data.\r\n\r\n- SMART NOTIFICATIONS: Connect the app to your chartplotter, and turn on smart notifications(4) to see calls, text messages and more on the chartplotter display while your phone is somewhere safe and dry.\r\n\r\n\nFOOTNOTES\r\n1)OnDeck hub sold separately and requires an active subscription plan\r\n2)Auto Guidance+ is for planning purposes only and does not replace safe navigation operations\r\n3)NOAA raster cartography cannot be viewed on echoMAP™ CHIRP and ECHOMAP™ Plus combos but can be viewed on mobile devices via the ActiveCaptain mobile app\r\n4)Helm feature is not compatible with ECHOMAP series chartplotters\r\n5)Check device compatibility on the ActiveCaptain app web page; visit https://www.garmin.com/c/marine/marine-apps/"

      "label": "PHOTOREALISTIC 3D MAPS FOR BETTER TRIP PLANNING\nThe award-winning outdoor navigation app is the perfect tool for planning your next trip and finding your way around. The unique photo-realistic 3D representation of the mountain landscape allows an intuitive, realistic assessment of the terrain and the requirements. Many practical features help you to plan your next trip. These include GPS tracking, a routing function, GPX import into the 3D map and map download for offline use.\n\n\n\nMAPS FOR SUMMER & WINTER\nThe 3D map summer is based on aerial photos with a resolution of 20 cm and a matchless terrain model with a resolution of 60 cm. For winter we provide a 3D relief map with all ski resorts and high-resolution aerial photos for selected regions.\n\n\n\nQUALITY-CERTED TOURS \nThe app offers hiking, mountain, ski and bike tours exclusively researched by experts from Bergverlag Rother and other partners. For all tours there is an elevation profile, photos and directions. With the GPS function, you can easily follow the marked route while on tour. A highlight is the import of any tours in GPX format or from Komoot into the 3D map.\n\n\n\nSIMPLE AND SAFE ORIENTATION ON THE MOVE\nWith the combination of 3D map, aerial photo and topographical relief map on a scale of 1:25,000, you can perfectly prepare yourself for a trip. With the routing function, you can plan new routes on the 3D map. The GPS tracking function turns your smartphone into a full-fledged navigation device. On tour, your current location is always displayed live on the map. A virtual 360° panorama with information about the surrounding landscape makes it easier for you to find your way around.\n\n\n\nRECORD YOUR OWN TRACKS\nWith the tracking function, you can record your track and display the route covered live on the 3D map. Duration, distance, altitude and speed are continuously determined. With a user account, you can save the recorded tracks in your personal tour cloud, transfer your tracks to other smartphones or tablets and share them with friends.\n\n\n\nMORE SAFETY IN THE MOUNTAINS - OFFLINE MAPS\nThe app offers an unprecedented level of security. In the photo-realistic 3D map you can read the exposure and condition of the terrain and identify danger spots. In bad weather, in fog or at night, you can find your way around as the map depicts the real terrain. Another safety aspect: you can load the maps onto your smartphone for offline use.\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVELY FOR PREMIUM USERS\nWith a PREMIUM subscription, you can record, save, share and transfer your tracks to other devices, save maps offline on your smartphone, import tours in GPX format and from Komoot, and plan tours in 3D. With the subscription we finance the further development of the app and the creation of the 3D maps. The subscription runs through the store and can be canceled at any time.\n\n\n\nFREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION\nWith a test subscription you can use all PREMIUM functions for one week free of charge.\n\n\n\nFor more information visit https://www.realitymaps.app/realitymaps-app/\n\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.realitymaps.app/agb/"

Only those receivers are compatible, which are officially supported by Apple. Due to the size of the package and certain In-App items, we recommend purchasing and downloading the application, In-App items or updates through WiFi or fixed line Internet access via the iTunes software installed on a personal computer.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Background navigation has to be turned on while using the application; you can do this under \"Settings / Advanced settings\" in iOS 7."

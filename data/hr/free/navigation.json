The app enables safe hiking and exploring of the Medvednica Nature Park, the green pearl of Zagreb which many call Zagreb’s lungs. \r\n\r\nIn these times of the COVID-19 pandemic, building immunity has become very important, and a way to achieve it is precisely by being active and spending time outdoors. The navigation and other functionalities of the application will encourage inexperienced hikers, promote hiking and, last but not least, thanks to this healthy trend, smaller number of cars can be expected on Sljeme.  \r\n\r\nThe city of Zagreb is one of the few capitals in the world with ‘its own hill' in the immediate vicinity, and Moje Sljeme application is, among other things, an excellent tool for attracting foreign visitors. Although Zagreb has proven to be a tempting tourist destination, the application can certainly contribute to new records in visits. \r\n\r\nSpending time outside is very important for health, so this is one of the ways the City of Zagreb wishes to convey to its citizens a message about the importance of outdoor activities, in strict adherence to epidemiological measures. This, along with other things, helps maintain mental health, which is not to be neglected, as well as physical health. \r\n\r\nThe functionalities include: navigation, lists of trails, lodges and other destinations such as springs, caves and sacral heritage, descriptions, image gallery, weather forecast, etc.\r\n\r\nLink to terms of service:\r\nhttps://www.zagreb.hr/terms-of-service/171564\r\n\r\nLink to privacy policy: \r\nhttps://www.zagreb.hr/privacy-policy/171563"

In a lower left corner there is a button \"Location\" in the shape of a sniper icon. By clicking this button your detected location gets placed in the center of a map and its movement gets followed. \n\n                For every reported patrol you can click and receive information about the probability that there is a patrol indeed located there, as well as who reported it first and last. You can confirm every patrol if you have seen it as well or negate it if the patrol is no longer in a reported location. Your every vote is recorded and if you provide truthful information your reliability gets increased or decreased if you provide misleading information. You can also leave a comment for any chosen patrol. The more reliability you have the more your vote is worth.\n\n                Please drive carefully and respect traffic regulations!

Barvna skala cest ponazarja pretočnost prometa. Deluje tako, da ženski glas voznika v slovenskem jeziku samodejno opozori na dogodek, ki voznika čaka na njegovi poti. Pri tem vozniku ni potrebno gledati v telefon, temveč lahko ostane osredotočen na vožnjo in cesto.\nPoleg obveščanja o dogodkih, vsebuje tudi vpogled v cestne  kamer. Vpogled v cestne kamere omogoča vozniku, da pregleda stanje na slovenskem avtocestnem križu, preden se odpravi na pot.\n \nAplikacija ima tudi tipko SOS. Tipka SOS pošlje sms s koordinatami vozila v klicni center AMZS. Sporočilo omogoča dežurni ekipi AMZS, da obvesti ustrezne intervencijske službe.\nTipka SOS igra zelo pomembno vlogo v primeru, ko udeleženec zaradi šoka ne zna točno opisati svoje lokacije. Tipka SOS zato uporabniku omogoča, da na enostaven način\nz enim SMS sporočilom posreduje svojo točno lokacijo in tako zelo olajša delo intervencijskim službam.\n \nZa točnost prometnih informacij skrbi posebej usposobljena ekipa prometnega servisa Radia 1 in informacijskega centra AMZS, vsak dan, od 6h do 24h.\n \n \n* Pogosta uporaba GPS-a v ozadju lahko hitreje izprazni baterijo.\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Most often, the land parcel can be a cadastral parcel, but it can also be part of an agricultural plot where you have for example planted apples. The corner points are defined with GPS (WGS84) coordinates known as latitude and longitude.\r\nAlso the corner points can be defined in other coordinate reference system provided by your geoportal. You can read the coordinates from the corresponding geoportal map.\r\n\r\nApp Features:\r\nIdentification of land parcels, cadastral parcels.\r\nDisplay your land parcels on a map on your smartphone.\r\nView the distance between the smartphone and the land parcel.\r\nView your current smartphone location on the map.\r\nRead the current GPS coordinates.\r\nImproved accuracy of the current GPS coordinates reading.\r\nCreate a land parcel by entering the coordinates.\r\nUpdate the entered coordinates.\r\nDownload the cadastral parcel coordinates from our web server\r\nTransformation from reference coordinates to Gps (WGS84) coordinates\r\nCalculation of land plot area and boundary line lengths.\r\nSave the land parcel files in your local smartphone storage.\r\nLanguage support for English, German, Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, Serbian, Czech, Slovak, Polish, Spanish, Portuguese, French.\r\nSupport for the coordinate systems and geoportals in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland and Europe.\r\nList of visible satellites\r\nSupport for GNSS and L1+L5\r\nRecord your current location data (coordinates, speed, time) while you walk or drive.

Ziel der DRONIQ, einem Joint Venture der Deutschen Flugsicherung (DFS) und der Deutschen Telekom ist die sichere und faire Integration von Drohnen in den Luftraum. \n\nPlanung, Prüfung und Durchführung von Missionen\n\nDie kostenfreie App ist konform mit der neuen EU-Verordnung und berücksichtigt die damit einhergehenden Vorschriften und Anforderungen für den Drohnenflug. Sie richtet sich insbesondere an Hobby- und Freizeitpiloten und unterstützt sie entlang der gesamten Missionsplanung und der anschließenden Durchführung. Nach der Missionsspezifizierung durch den Piloten prüft die App die Mission in Echtzeit mit Blick auf die geltenden Luftraumverordnungen und -beschränkungen. Der Nutzer wird innerhalb weniger Minuten informiert, ob seine geplante Mission erlaubt ist. Die Frage „Wo darf ich fliegen“ wird durch die App somit schnell beantwortet. Bekommt der Nutzer ein negatives Ergebnis, kann er über die App im Detail prüfen, welche Vorgaben bei der aktuellen Missionsplanung noch nicht eingehalten werden und diese entsprechend anpassen. \n\n \n\nNeben luftraumrelevanten Daten zeigt interaktives Kartenmaterial die typische Infrastruktur, wie Krankenhäuser, Polizeistationen usw. an und warnt den Nutzer, wenn seine Distanz hierzu zu gering ist. Weitere Karteninformationen können benutzerdefiniert ein- und ausgeblendet werden. In der Logbuch-Funktion werden bereits durchgeführte Flüge übersichtlich dargestellt und können nachträglich bewertet und mit Details versehen werden. Weiterhin kann der Nutzer sein Profil anpassen und Drohnen hinzufügen bzw. bearbeiten."

In-App purchase can be used to remove the bottom advertisement and to support us.\n\nThis application does not need an internet connection and works best in outdoors.\n\nBy default, it uses device sensor to determine the elevation from see level, but you also have the option to use NOAA data files to get the altitude of your location. On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

The app helps you navigate to your destination and as a cherry on top, you get to start a parking action upon arrival. All of this in a single app and throughout the whole of Europe. Making your life easier, safer and more efficient before, during and after your trip, Flitsmeister is your best friend! \n\nThere are several other ways in which Flitsmeister will make your life easier: \n\n• Mobile and fixed speed cam, speed check zone alerts; to save your hard-earned cash.   \n\n• Traffic jam alerts; check in advance whether you will be encountering a traffic jam on your route and start a new route if necessary. \n\n• Service vehicle alerts such as ambulances and fire trucks, to help you get out of the way calmly and in time so they can reach their destination more quickly.  \n\n• Accidents, roadworks, stationary vehicles and other incident alerts: allowing you to anticipate the situation safely and in time. \n\n• Matrix sign alerts: never miss a closed exit, opened rush hour lane or maximum speed instructions ever again. \n\n• Navigation: the right instructions to get from A to B, taking into account the current situation on the road or recommending a different route if disturbances are expected on your route.  \n\n• Paid parking: start a parking action upon arrival at your destination with the tap of a button. The app will recognise whether you are located in a parking zone to make sure you don’t forget to start the parking action. We will send you a notification as soon as you get back behind the wheel so you never forget to stop your parking action and never overpay. \n\n• Traffic lights: certain traffic lights in the Netherlands will send their current status to the app. The number of these ‘smart’ traffic lights will be increasing in the future, allowing us to show you a countdown for the green light and speed recommendations to keep you in the green wave. \n\n• Apple Carplay for Flitsmeister on the screen of your car: navigate to your destination even more conveniently by displaying Flitsmeister on the screen of your car. Of course, you will also keep receiving the usual alerts for speed cams, traffic jams and hazards during your trip. \n\n\nCOMMUNITY \nOur entire team is dedicated to making the app better and more complete every single day.

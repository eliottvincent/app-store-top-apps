Every user can confirm or negate a patrol that had been reported as well.\n\n              With the help of a complex algorhythm, every user's reliability and the probability of an existing patrol are calculated and only the most accurate information get shown to all users.\n\n                In a lower right corner there is a button that is used to report a police patrol. In a lower left corner there is a button \"Location\" in the shape of a sniper icon. By clicking this button your detected location gets placed in the center of a map and its movement gets followed. \n\n                For every reported patrol you can click and receive information about the probability that there is a patrol indeed located there, as well as who reported it first and last. You can confirm every patrol if you have seen it as well or negate it if the patrol is no longer in a reported location. Your every vote is recorded and if you provide truthful information your reliability gets increased or decreased if you provide misleading information. You can also leave a comment for any chosen patrol. The more reliability you have the more your vote is worth.\n\n                Please drive carefully and respect traffic regulations! Reckless driving puts you and all other traffic participants in danger. MyPatrol serves exclusively as a way to share information between the drivers.\n\nMyPatrol, My Patrol, Moja patrola, NaÅ¡a patrola, Nasa patrola"

Barvna skala cest ponazarja pretočnost prometa. Deluje tako, da ženski glas voznika v slovenskem jeziku samodejno opozori na dogodek, ki voznika čaka na njegovi poti. Pri tem vozniku ni potrebno gledati v telefon, temveč lahko ostane osredotočen na vožnjo in cesto.\nPoleg obveščanja o dogodkih, vsebuje tudi vpogled v cestne  kamer. Vpogled v cestne kamere omogoča vozniku, da pregleda stanje na slovenskem avtocestnem križu, preden se odpravi na pot.\n \nAplikacija ima tudi tipko SOS. Tipka SOS pošlje sms s koordinatami vozila v klicni center AMZS. Sporočilo omogoča dežurni ekipi AMZS, da obvesti ustrezne intervencijske službe.\nTipka SOS igra zelo pomembno vlogo v primeru, ko udeleženec zaradi šoka ne zna točno opisati svoje lokacije. Tipka SOS zato uporabniku omogoča, da na enostaven način\nz enim SMS sporočilom posreduje svojo točno lokacijo in tako zelo olajša delo intervencijskim službam.\n \nZa točnost prometnih informacij skrbi posebej usposobljena ekipa prometnega servisa Radia 1 in informacijskega centra AMZS, vsak dan, od 6h do 24h.\n \n \n* Pogosta uporaba GPS-a v ozadju lahko hitreje izprazni baterijo.\n* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

During the rest of the time, the card is inactive, and transactions will be declined. Simply start the 60-minute time window during which fuel can be purchased. After the time has expired, the card is automatically deactivated again.\n\nWhat other benefits does the DKV Mobility App offer?\n\nIf you need immediate assistance, for example in the event of a breakdown or the loss of your card, the app offers direct dialing to connect you to the helpline.\n\nYou can find more information about our range of services at https://www.dkv-mobility.com/en/. \n\nDKV. You drive, we care."

      "label": "MiraTrex PRO CHARTS™ is a powerful, yet easy-to-use marine navigation system. Whether you’re a fisherman, weekend cruiser, sailor, diver, jet-skier, or an offshore captain needing to find an exact location hundreds of miles offshore, PRO CHARTS™ will get you there and back home safely – with nothing more than your iPhone or iPad.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\n\n• High-resolution NOAA nautical chart coverage with depths for all U.S. coastal areas, the Great Lakes, major U.S. river systems, and Brazil plus global high-level nautical charts. Charts are automatically updated based on NOAA chart corrections.\n\n• Easy one-touch Waypoint and Route creation. Pre-plan your routes at home or create them at sea with equal ease. Just touch the screen to create new waypoints and routes.\n\n• Find your friends on the water. With our new Buddy-tracking feature, you can see and meet up with your friends while you’re out on the water. If you’re on your secret spot and don’t want to be seen, you can hide your location with the touch of a button.\n\n• Stay safe. Easily create and send a Float Plan of your trip to a friend or family member. Your Float Plan and location history can be forwarded to search and rescue personnel in case of an emergency.\n\n• Easy point-and-steer navigation. The red heading bug on the large on-screen compass always directs you to the next point on your route. Navigation is as easy as pointing your boat at the heading bug to stay on course.\n\n• No Network. No Problem. PRO CHARTS™ is designed so no internet connection is required to view your charts while out on the water. You simply download in advance any charts you’ll need at sea with the touch of a button.\n\n• Record your tracks. Track your position in real-time and later view your track history.\n\n• Fully indexed point of interest (POI) database including weather, aids to navigation (markers and lights), obstructions, tides, currents, your buddies, and more.\n\n\nWebsite: www.miratrex.com\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\nPlans:\n\nBase app with limited features - Free \n14 day trial of all premium features - Free\nAll premium features (Monthly) - $2.99\nAll premium features (Annual) - $29.99 (Save 16%, about 2 months free)\n\n\n\n-Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\n-Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n-You will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for that product.\n\n-You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the Apple Settings app after purchase.\n\n-No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.

Third-party Bluetooth GPS units are available to enable GPS for iOS devices such as WiFi-only iPads that do not include a GPS receiver.

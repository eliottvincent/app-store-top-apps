You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance.  \n\nThis set of widgets can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define.  For example, a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your work day, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day.  This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\nActivity widgets require a paired Apple Watch\n\nThe app itself also includes a wide collection of tools, such as a weather app, a timezone converter, a calendar.  These tools can automatically launch based on the active widget tapped.\n\nNotes:\n • Widgetsmith optionally integrates with Apple Health.  This data is used to display your step and activity if you select one of those widget types.  Permission for Widgetsmith to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.  \n• Widgetsmith includes an optional premium subscription.  This is offered on a monthly or annual basis.  If you choose to purchase a subscription your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\n• Access to Tide and Weather hosted data is only available to Widgetsmith Premium subscribers.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith_privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith-terms-of-use.html"

Backup and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency.

You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions.

Was it voluntarily or maybe someone just deactivated their account? Headaches and worries in the past, Yupi does everything for you!\n\nJust imagine how much time you save by not creating a list of followers, trying to figure out who started following and who unfollowed. All these tables and lists would drive anyone crazy, and still will not give a clear understanding of, for example, when exactly a person stopped following your profile.\n\nAs soon as you install Yupi, app immediately starts watching all changes in your activity, with an accuracy of a second. The application notifies you not only about followers and unfollowers, but also shows detailed statistics of your stories, who watched your Instagram stories, how many times, which story is the most popular, and which, on the contrary, is not popular at all. Have you been unfollowed? Unfollow them back! Or maybe you have devoted fans? It's just so easy to find out, Yupi makes a separate list of those who follow you without following them back.\nAnd that's not all. Yupi enlarges your profile pictures in no time. Zoom the profile picture with one click, now you don't have to peer into a small image.\n\nYou can contact for support info@yupireport.com\n\nInformation about the auto-renewable nature of the subscriptions\nEvery time you can reach your updated reports and if you want to continue getting reports, your subscription should be continued.\nSubscription periods are 1 month, 6 months and 1 year.

We automatically organize all the things life throws at you, like receipts and attachments, so you can find what you need fast. Plus, we've got your back with other convenient features like one-tap unsubscribe, free trial expiration alerts and package tracking. \n\nFavorite features:\n\n• One-tap unsubscribe from pushy promos\nSkip the tiny unsubscribe links at the end of long emails. We organize all your mailing lists in one spot, so it’s easy to unsubscribe from noisy newsletters and promos with a quick tap. \n\n• Organize and navigate your inbox with ease\nFind what you need fast with inbox filters that sort your emails by attachments, starred, unread, and more. Stay organized and clear out the junk by deleting or moving up to 10,000 emails at once from a particular sender or category. \n\n• Quickly spot receipts & package delivery updates\nSee all your receipts organized in one place so you can easily find the one you're looking for. Plus, see the status of all your upcoming deliveries at a glance. Top-of-inbox package tracking alerts means you'll never miss a delivery. \n\n• Pull up the best deals from your inbox\nNo more searching through countless promotional emails to find those savings. This view organizes your inbox around your favorite stores and the categories you shop. Now, find all your favorite deals—without the clutter.\n\n• Keep tabs on your free trials\nGet reminders before free trials expire—so you can update your subscription plan or cancel before the subscription trial ends. \n\n• Customize your notifications\nChoose which notifications you really need and say bye-bye to the ones you don't. You can turn on alerts for emails from people, bills & receipts, deals, travel, reminders or general messages. \n\n• Connect your other accounts\nBring your Gmail, AOL, or Microsoft accounts and take advantage of extra features. Set your own swipe actions, change up the sounds or swap in your favorite color. (We like purple)\n\n• Accessibility\nMaking sure our products are accessible is a priority. Yahoo Mail has high contrast themes, dynamic text resizing and VoiceOver screen reader compatibility. Plus, folders at the bottom of the inbox allow assistive technology users to navigate with less effort.\n\n• 1,000GB free storage\nThat's 985 more than some other inboxes, just sayin. ;) Download the app and enjoy a more spacious inbox.\n\n• Yahoo Mail Plus \nGet ad-free mail, extra organization and privacy features, plus 24/7 tech support across your iOS mobile devices.\n\n+        Available as an in-app purchase at $1.99/month charged to your iTunes account\n+        Subscription will auto-renew each month within 24 hours of your renewal date\n+        Manage or cancel your subscription via Account Settings\n\nTerms of service: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/otos/index.html\nPrivacy policy: https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.html\n\nHow are we doing?

Unlike other cloud storage providers, your data is encrypted and decrypted by your client devices only and never by us.\n\nUpload files from your smartphone or tablet, then search, store, download, stream, view, share, rename or delete them any time, from any device, anywhere. Share folders with your contacts and see their updates in real time.\n\nMEGA’s strong and secure end-to-end encryption means we cannot access or reset your password. You MUST remember your password and make sure to back up your account Recovery Key. Losing your password and the account Recovery Key will result in lost access to your files.\n\nUse the included MEGA Secure Chat for end-to-end-encrypted communications, including video and audio calls, with total privacy. Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency. The code of our iOS mobile app is located at: https://github.com/meganz/ios\n\nSubscriptions renew automatically for successive periods of the same duration at the same price as the initial period chosen. You can cancel the automatic renewal of your MEGA Pro subscription no later than 24 hours before your next subscription payment is due, via your iTunes account settings page. To manage your subscriptions, tap on the App Store icon on your device, sign in with your Apple ID at the bottom of the page (if you haven’t already done so) and then tap View ID. You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions. From there, you can select your MEGA Pro subscription and view your scheduled renewal date, choose a different subscription package or toggle the on-off switch to off to disable the auto-renewal of your subscription.\n\nTerms of Service: https://mega.io/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://mega.io/privacy"

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

Was it voluntarily or maybe someone just deactivated their account? Headaches and worries in the past, Yupi does everything for you!\n\nJust imagine how much time you save by not creating a list of followers, trying to figure out who started following and who unfollowed. All these tables and lists would drive anyone crazy, and still will not give a clear understanding of, for example, when exactly a person stopped following your profile.\n\nAs soon as you install Yupi, app immediately starts watching all changes in your activity, with an accuracy of a second. The application notifies you not only about followers and unfollowers, but also shows detailed statistics of your stories, who watched your Instagram stories, how many times, which story is the most popular, and which, on the contrary, is not popular at all. Have you been unfollowed? Unfollow them back! Or maybe you have devoted fans? It's just so easy to find out, Yupi makes a separate list of those who follow you without following them back.\nAnd that's not all. Yupi enlarges your profile pictures in no time. Zoom the profile picture with one click, now you don't have to peer into a small image.\n\nYou can contact for support info@yupireport.com\n\nInformation about the auto-renewable nature of the subscriptions\nEvery time you can reach your updated reports and if you want to continue getting reports, your subscription should be continued.\nSubscription periods are 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. Every month, 6 months or year your subscription renews.\n1 month subscription price is $4.99. 6 Months Subscription price is $18.99. 1 year price is $24,99.\nSubscriptions will automatically renew unless cancelled at least one day before the renewal date within 24 hours before the end of the current period.\nPayment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.\nIf you subscribe before a free trial ends, the remainder of the trial period will be forfeited.\nYou can manage and cancel your subscription by going to your account settings in the App Store\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://yupireport.com/privacy-policy\nTerms and Conditions: https://yupireport.com/terms\nEULA: https://yupireport.com/eula\n\nThis app only provides analytics for your instagram account.

      "label": "Flora is a new way to stay off your phone, clear to-do lists, and build positive, life-changing habits. Whenever you want to make progress towards your goals, plant a seed in Flora. As you work hard, the seed will grow into a healthy tree. Let the tree be your coach and grow yourself with it. You will be amazed by how great you can be.\n\nFOCUS TREES\n\nHave trouble putting down the phone? Flora blocks distracting apps in a pleasant way to help you focus on what’s more important in real life. If you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app while growing a tree, the tree will be killed! But if succeeding, you'll unlock new trees.\n\nDOUBLE EFFICIENCY WITH FRIENDS \n\nThings get even more interesting when you challenge your friends to plant trees together—you will see who kills a tree (ouch). However, if you successfully stay away from your phones together, each of you will win an additional tree from a random friend. You can also chat and share your progress to motivate each other and keep everyone on track.*\n\n* Flora is the original app for multi-user tree planting and delivers the best features that help you and your friends be productive. \n\nTO-DO LIST & WIDGET\n\nFlora is a to-do list, and more. Simply create a to-do item and set a reminder, then you will never forget a thing. Even better, you can tag your trees with a to-do item to easily track the progress towards each of your life goals. No matter if your goal is daily, weekly, or monthly, Flora will help you follow it through and achieve it.\n\nHABIT TRACKER\n\nEnjoy a rewarding daily habit routine. If you grow trees regularly, you will earn yourself a beautiful, vibrant garden. Take a look at it and feel proud of yourself! Each tree records your perseverance and a step towards a healthy life. You can also view the daily, weekly, or monthly statistics of your activities in Flora to find opportunities to improve your time-management and planning skills.\n\nREAL TREES, REAL IMPACT\n\nWhy not plant REAL trees while improving yourself? Flora proudly offers the opt-in Price and Care services that let you plant real trees on the earth if you kill or successfully grow a tree in the app. We partner with tree-planting organizations in Africa and East Asia, such as the Trees.org, to plant fast-growing soil rebuilding trees, fruit trees that diversify incomes and nutrition, and trees that can provide forage and fuel-wood. All these trees help make the earth greener and provide long-term financial aid to families who need it most.\n\nSounds good? Download Flora and join our 2,000,000+ productive users now!"

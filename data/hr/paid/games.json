Don’t get burned and jump between walls to collect coins and medallions. Break stone blocks and activate platforms before you fall into fog and much more...\n\nA RUNNING ADVENTURE\n\nManuganu is a 3D side-scroller running game, in which you control the boy “Manuganu”.\nUnlike other usual running games, Manuganu brings on the “Halt feature” to avoid swinging rocks, hammers, flames and other enemies with the right timing. Another important feature of Manuganu is the ability to switch from “running” mode to “rope climbing” mode when needed. But be careful! This mode has its own challenges.\n\nGAME FEATURES\n\n•Platforming Actions: Double Jumping, Wall Sliding, Hovering, Wall Jumping, Rolling, Breaking Stone Blocks\n•Run through 30 different levels, each with it’s own unique design according to the level theme.\n•Two button controls and specific swipe controls.\n•Run into alternate paths to get 3 Star in all Levels.\n•Three different environments with full 3D graphics.\n•Original Soundtrack by Tolga YURDABAK\n•Turkish-English Language Support"

      "label": "RETRO TWIST is a new take on some old and modern classic games. It mashes up the game mechanics of your favourite games to create something new. You can play on your Apple Watch or iPhone.\n\nThis collection of 18 games includes:\n\n■ MISSILE\nHow long can you survive a deadly onslaught of homing missiles? Maneuver your fighter plane to avoid the missiles and make them crash into each other. \n\n■ HOP\nJump from platform to platform to gain more height and points. Shoot the winged baddies along the way.\n\n■ Drift\nEnjoy high octane drifting down a treacherous road. One false move and down you go. Try and survive as long as you can to get the top score. Collect the stars for bonus points.\n\n■ Cong\nIt's like pong, but in a circle. Use the digital crown to move the paddle around the circle and keep the ball in play.\n\n■ Tower\nBuild your Tower by stacking colourful blocks on top of each other. Place them perfectly for bonus points.\n\n■ FLAP\nGuide the bird through a never ending forest by flapping your wings.\n\n■ FROG ROAD\nHelp the cute frogs avoid the cars and cross the road. A 3D update to the classic Frogger game.\n\n■ BLOCK RUN\nFeel like going for a a run? Help the voxel guy avoid the colourful obstacles by jumping, rolling and turning around the corners.\n\n■ MATCHTRIS\nA mashup of Tetris and Dr. Mario. Move the falling blocks to match 4 or more colors to clear them. Setup the blocks to fall and match for combos and extra points.\n\n■ DRONE\nPilot your drone down the never ending corridors of an Alien spaceship.\n\n■ THRUST\nStrap your rocket boots on and zoom down a dark cave. Thrust combines a classic cave flyer game with elements of flappy bird.\n\n■ SUPER JUMP\nWe’ve taken the fun of the humble platformer game and mashed it with an endless runner. Keep your player running by jumping over holes, ditches and enemies. Collect fruit to score points and the more you score the faster you run. \n\n■ RETRO RACER\nInspired by pseudo 3d racing games like Outrun and Pole Position but with modern graphics. Enjoy the surreal, exhilarating sense of speed while you race to beat the clock.\n\nPlease note this game requires a watch series 4 or newer.\n\n■ CONTRA PANG\nA mashup of Contra’s shooting action and the bubble popping fun of Pang.\n\n■ CIRCLE INVADERS\nA new twist to the classic Space Invaders. With a unique circular design and lots of power-ups.\n\n■ MOON SNAKE\nWe took the classic fruit eating snake and put him on the moon. Avoid the bombs and your own tail to survive. \n\n■ DUAL BREAK\nWhat could be better than the classic paddle game Breakout? How about power-ups and an extra paddle to control.\n\n■ CIRCLE BREAK\nIt’s like Pong in a Circle meets Breakout. Keep the ball from leaving the circle and break all the obstacles to finish the stage.\n\nFeatures:\n• No ads!\n• Apple Watch support\n• Screen shake\n• Vibrations\n• Sound Effects \n• Music\n• Leaderboards"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

Water, Oil, and Lava fall from Droppers and bounce around the walls of the puzzle. You move and rotate various types of bumpers, sliders, accelerators, and sponges in order to divert the flow of the falling droplets. The faster you complete each of the 50 levels, the more bonus points you receive.\n\nThe physics in Enigmo are truly amazing to watch!  This is one of the most unique puzzle games ever created.\n\nIn addition to the 50 levels that come with the game, you can also download many more levels for free!  As of version 1.1, you can download levels created by other users or by yourself with the Mac or PC version of Enigmo which has a built-in level editor.  You may submit your levels to us and we'll include them in the public list if we like them enough.\n\n_______________\n\nWatch the behind the scenes video:  http://pangeasoft.net/iphone/behindthescenes.html"

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

Experience complete freedom and get value for your money! Use Cuba-Junky’s Casa Particular Directory app as your simple and user friendly ‘Yellow Pages’ while planning, traveling and exploring!\n\nWhy you need this app when you plan to visit Cuba \n- Cuba friendly and explorer friendly (simple, practical and cheap!)\n- Several updates a week with new casas and features \n- Even more casas in the app than on our website\n - Direct contact with the casa through the app\n - Save yourself  $5 per night by using the app to contact the owners directly  \n\nWhat are casas particulares? \nCuba’s version of B&Bs offer the island’s best lodging values for anyone who likes doing things authentically, or in this case: the Cuban way. You can find hundreds of casas in this app. They are rooms, suites, or sometimes entire apartments. The Cuba-Junky casa directory app is current, convenient, and easy to use. It provides casa photos, phone numbers, email addresses, Facebook and website links—all for about US $5!  \n\nOnline, offline and more \nBut there is more. The casa particular directory app is very frequently updated at no extra charge. And you can access other types of info through the app, such as the weather forecast, or use it to contact your casa.\n\n  No commission: save $5 per night! \nBy using this app and contacting a casa directly, you often save the $5 per night commission that the owner normally charges for bookings made through a third party. Casa owners pay no commission or other costs to Cuba Junky. Say this to the casa owner and get that discount!\n\n  Some free Cuba advice?\n Cuba-Junky’s advice is: make a reservation for your first night in Cuba and after that just “go with the flow.” Using your Cuba-Junky casa particular app, it will be easy to find casas while in Cuba, or to call ahead to a casa in the next town you plan to visit. You can talk to the owner directly, find out what’s available, and at what price.   \n\nWhy does this app cost about $5?  \nJust because Cuba Junky have to keep it running. We charge no hidden $5 per night commission. We just love Cuba. If you do too, go and enjoy it, and while you’ re at it, help us keep Cuban locals in the lead! ¡Gracias amigos!"

If there are several flights per day, you can avoid an overbooked flight. Even if you have a confirmed ticket, your seat cannot be guaranteed for that flight due to the overbooking policy of most airlines. Internet connection is required for Seat Availability Search and other sections do not need internet connection. Password is not required for this application. This application can be downloaded and used on iPads. Just Search \"iFlyZED\" on iPad App Store but select iPhone only as filter selection. Search again with iPhone only filter, download it on your iPad."

Street View coverage is displayed in blue.\n\n\nEASY TO USE\nWalking through panoramas has never been easier using the interactive, expandable mini map that also displays your viewing angle and field of view. Virtually traveling abroad is even more immersive and fun with Live Panorama mode: Turn around in the panorama simply by rotating the device.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH APP\nStreets is the only app capable of displaying 360° Street View panoramas on the Apple Watch. Just turn your wrist or pan to turn around in any direction. Use the digital crown to zoom. Streets for Apple Watch automatically syncs favorites and recent searches with your iPhone.\n\n\nOPEN FROM MAPS & OTHER APPS \n“Open location in Streets” displays nearby panoramas from websites, from „Maps“ or „Contacts“, or from many other apps that support sharing of locations and addresses. If you’re already using our location finder app Where To?, you’ll also be able to take advantage of a tight, bidirectional integration.\n\n\nDRAG & DROP\nOn iPad or Mac, drag a pin location from the Maps app, a contact, or a textual address into the Streets app to find nearby panoramas. Even geotagged photos can be dropped in Streets to find 360° spherical images near the photo location.\n\n\nCOMMUNICATIVE\nShare Street View panoramas using drag-and-drop (on iPad) or the share sheet. Handoff and AirDrop let you easily transfer the currently viewed panorama between multiple devices. Mark panoramas as favorites that are automatically synced between devices. Rename favorites and organize them in folders.\n\n\n2000+ GALLERY PLACES \nMore than 2000 hand-picked “Gallery Places” show spectacular places such as museums, castles, national parks, ski slopes and even underwater attractions. Geysers in Yellowstone national park, old masterpieces in Amsterdam’s van Gogh museum or NASA’s rocket launch pad in Cape Kennedy are just a few of the breathtaking places waiting to be explored. Gallery places also include background information such as descriptions and links.\n\n\n\nMORE FEATURES\n- Supports iPad Pro, Split View and Slide Over\n- Supports keyboard navigation (with Bluetooth or Smart Keyboard)\n- Spotlight search also finds Streets panoramas\n- Siri can create reminders with a link to the currently displayed panorama\n- Supports the “Shortcuts” app\n\n\nWHAT OTHERS SAY\n\n“I highly recommend Streets 3.“\n- John Voorhees, MacStories\n\n“it’s hard to imagine Cupertino doing it better than Streets 3”\n4.5/5 mice\n- J.R. Bookwalter, Macworld\n\n“If you haven't migrated to Google Maps on iOS because you're OK with Apple Maps but you miss Google Street View, here's a pretty easy solution.“\n- Mel Martin, Engadget\n\n“Thankfully, with Streets, you can continue using Maps and still be able to quickly pull up Street View without ever feeling like you’ve left the app.“\n- Jordan Khan, 9to5Mac\n\n\nTwitter & Facebook\nCheck us out on Twitter: @futuretap\nand Facebook: http://facebook.com/streetviewapp"

No Login. \n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Francés, the most popular route across Spain. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 900 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 900+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

It shows informations about the region where a car is registered and links to the maps application, so that you can see on the map where the car is coming from and use the maps application to let it show you the way to that specific location.

Once you've spotted a plate you can mark it and build up your collection of plates you've seen on the street.\n\nThis application is ideal for longer road trips.

It looks at aviation weather that pilots look at to give you a realistic prognostic of what to possibly expect. One can see turbulence embedded in thunderstorms as pilots see it. Designed by an airline pilot, it uses a combination of aviation knowledge and NLP Neuro Linguistic Programming techniques to help you reduce your fear of turbulence. Turbcast is easy to use.

All updates are free.\n\nNow in their 11th year as a mobile app, and their 13th online, the Wise Pilgrim Guides are the go-to source of up-to-date information on the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe app is updated regularly with new content and new features and offers you the ability to leave tips for pilgrims following behind you.\n\nThis guide covers the Camino Portugués and its three most common variations; the Central Route, the Coastal Route, and the Variante Espiritual. It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 400 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

It has been redesigned and now works almost exclusively offline (to share your comments with others will require a data connection).  As more an more albergues share their WiFi this becomes less of an issue, and the guide will tell you which ones offer WiFi.\n\nAccommodation Directory:  \nA full directory of Albergues, camping, hotels, pensions, paradors, and cases rurales.  Over 500 in total, with special attention to those that can be booked online.\n\nStageless Guide:\nNo more \"stage anxiety\" or guide created bottlenecks.\n\nMaps:  \nOffline and online versions of a beautiful topographical may will give you a good view of the terrain ahead.\n\nPhotos: \nPhotos of albergues, monuments and other points of interest along the way.  Currently 400+ images and growing.\n\nScrollable Elevation Map:  \nThis one is hard to show with just a screenshot, but the elevation that appears at the top of every city page scrolls East to West.  One complete elevation, from Irún to Santiago, uninterrupted by page folds.\n\nComments:  \nAlbergue closed early for the season?  Have a restaurant that you want to share, or perhaps one to warn others about?  Every location in the app gives you the opportunity to leave a comment and to read the comments left by others. No registration necessary.\n\n¡Buen Camino and thank you for your support!"

      "label": "The bar code on your airline boarding pass has a wealth of information.  Boarding Pass Scanner helps you to decode it quickly and easily.  \n\nSimply launch the application, click on \"Scan Barcode,\" and point your camera at the 2D barcode on your airplane boarding pass.  All the hidden details will be displayed in an easy-to-read format.  Boarding Pass Scanner interprets the data so you can quickly see what's there.  Other barcode scanning applications simply present the encoded text, requiring you to hunt through to find the information.\n\nFeatures:\n• Display the data from any standard airline boarding pass in an easy-to-read manner\n• Easily track your flight status with no typing required\n• Ensure your frequent-flier number is encoded so you get your miles\n• Quickly share your flight information with friends and family via email\n• Validate that your TSA Pre√ access is properly encoded in your boarding pass\n\nIf you are a frequent flier, you will find that this application comes in handy, especially during irregular operations, when your flight can change at a moment's notice.  Scan the boarding pass and email it to colleagues, family, or friends so they have your updated flight information.\n\nNote that although most airlines follow the barcoded boarding pass standard (we have successfully tested dozens of airlines, around the world), some airlines don't exactly follow the standard.  As we identify them them, we continue update the app to support them.  If you find a Boarding pass that doesn't properly decode, contact our support with a clear photo of your boarding pass, and we will add support for that airline.\n\n-- Please note that this app does not change a paper boarding pass to a mobile boarding pass.  Not all airlines support mobile boarding passes at all stations; please refer to your airline for more information on obtaining mobile boarding passes.  This application presents the information encoded in a barcoded boarding pass for your inspection. --"

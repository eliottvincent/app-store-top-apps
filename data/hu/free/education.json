Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "2021 rohanó világában keveseknek jut ideje a fontosabb dolgokra is, így a személyes fejlődés és a vágyak beteljesítése is sokaknak okoz időkezelési problémát. Amennyiben jogosítványt szeretne szerezni, aminek elengedhetetlen feltétele a kresz vizsga megléte, anélkül, hogy több tucat órát áldozna fel értékes szabadidejéből, kérjük tekintse meg hogy lehet segítségére alkalmazásunk\r\nOnline kurzus\r\nAz interneten bárhol is bármikor hozzáférhető oktatóanyagunk segítségével nem kell szabadidejét főként utazással töltenie, hogy eljusson oktatója tantermi foglalkozásaira. Akkor és ott tanulhat, amikor ideje és ereje engedi. Videóink megkönnyítik az elméleti vizsgához szükséges elméleti tudás elsajátítását, hogy sikeresen letehesse a kresz vizsgát és utána is kamatoztathassa tudását a mindennapokban.\r\n\r\nGyakorló kérdések\r\nAz elsajátított tananyag elmélyítésre a legjobb módszer a gyakorlás. Ehhez alakalmásunk véletlenszerű kérdésekkel járul hozzá, hogy a megszerzett tudás ne maradjon meg az elmélet szintjén, hanem gyakorlati haszonná váljon, amit mind a kresz vizsgán, mind az életben haszonnal használhat.\r\nKresz táblák\r\nA 2021-ben forgalomban lévő útjelző táblák teljes kínálatát tartalmazza az alkalmazásunk. Férjen hozzá bármikor és bárhonnan ehhez a tudásanyaghoz, hogy élete részévé válhassanak. Például, ha utazás vagy közlekedés közben meglát egyet könnyedén, néhány mozdulattal férhet hozzá a helyes meghatározáshoz, vagy amennyiben nem biztos benne melyik is került az útjába, könnyedén ellenőrízheti önmagát alkalmazásunk segítségével. \r\nTeszt szimulátor\r\nA jogosítvány megszerzéshez elengedhetetlen a sikeres kresz vizsga letétele. A legtöbb ember nem veszi számításba az időt. Sokaknak problémát okoz, hogy adott időkereten belül oldjanak meg adott számú feladatot. Ehhez nyújt kitűnő gyakorlási lehetőséget alkalmazásunk ezen része, mivel megteremti a vizsga körülményeit ahányszor csak szeretné. Így megszokássá válhat az elsajátított anyag megfelelő visszaadása és magabiztosan kezdhet neki az éles vizsgának.\r\nTesztek mentése\r\nAz elvégzett kérdéssorok elmentésre kerülnek alkalmazásunkban, így bármikor vissza lehet nézni azokat. Ez nagyban megkönnyíti a gyengébb területek felderítését és megerősítését, ugyanakkor sokkal könnyebben nyomon követhető a fejlődés.\n\n-------------\nSubscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period.

Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language?

It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer.

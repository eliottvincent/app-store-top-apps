Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking.

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Are you trying to quit smoking? If you are finding it hard to stop smoking, QuitNow is made for you.\n\nFirst things first: you know smoking is bad for your body. Even so, lots of people keep smoking. So why should you quit? When you quit smoking, you improve the quality and length of your life and the lives of the people around you. One way to prepare to successfully launch your smoke-free life is to power up your phone with QuitNow.\n\nQuitNow is a proven app that engages you to quit smoking. It aims to avoid tobacco just by giving you a picture of yourself. Quitting smoking is easier when you focus your effort on these four sections:\n\n- Your ex-smoker status: When you quit smoking, the focus has to be on you. Remember the day you quitted and get the maths: how many days are you free of smoke, how much money you saved, and how many cigarettes you avoided.\n\n- Achievements: your quit smoking motivations: As with all tasks in life, quitting smoking is easier when you divide the task into small and easy ones. So, QuitNow offers you 70 goals based on the cigarettes you avoided, the days since your last cigarette, and the money saved. So, you will start celebrating achievements from the first day.\n\n- Community: the ex-smokers chat: When you quit smoking, you need to stay within the non-smoking areas. QuitNow offers a chat full of people that, like you, said goodbye to tobacco. Spending time with nonsmokers will make your way easier.\n\n- Your ex-smoker health: QuitNow offers a list of health indicators to explain how your body improves day by day. They are based in the World Health Organization ones, and we update them as soon as the W.H.O. does.\n\n\nIn addition, there are more sections in the preferences screen that could help you in your way to quitting smoking.\n\n- Frequent Asked Questions: there are some tips to quit smoking, and honestly, we don’t know where to put them. Most quitters look for tips on the internet, and there are lots of fake tips there. We researched in the World Health Organization archives to find the investigations they made and the conclusions they had. In the Frequent Asked Questions, you will find all the answers to those questions you have about quitting smoking.\n\n- The QuitNow bot: sometimes, you have strange questions that don’t appear in the F.A.Q. In those cases, you can ask the bot: we train her to answer those strange ones. If she doesn’t have a good answer, she will contact the QuitNow crew and they will update their knowledge base, so she will learn the best answers to your questions. By the way, yes: all the bot answers are extracted from the W.H.O. archives, as the F.A.Q. tips.\n\n- Books to quit smoking: knowing some techniques about quitting smoking makes the task easier. There's always someone talking about books in the chat, so we made an investigation to know which are the most popular, and which ones can actually help you to quit smoking for good.\n\n\nDo you have any idea to make QuitNow even better? If so, please do write to us at ios@fewlaps.com\n\nTerms of Service: https://tos.quitnow.app/eula\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://tos.quitnow.app/privacypolicy"

Egy helyen fellelhető minden, amire csak szükséged lehet ebben az időszakban, legyen szó szakmai tartalomról vagy a kényelmi funkciókról. Magyarországon jelenleg az egyetlen hitelesített kismama app az Anyafalva, hiszen alkalmazásunkat hivatalosan Hiteles Egészségügyi weboldalnak/applikációnak minősítette a Hiteles Egészségügyi Kommunikációért Egyesület. \r\n\nHétről hétre követheted kisbabád cseperedését, megtudhatod mi történik vele és veled az adott héten. Széleskörű és megbízható szakmai tartalmat kapsz a fejlődési szakaszokról - amelyet a változást követő képek tesznek könnyebben elképzelhetővé és még izgalmasabbá.\r\n\nAz egyik kedvenc részed lesz Anyafalvában, hogy a gyermekvárás körüli időszak összes felmerülő kérdésére választ találsz majd a mindenre kiterjedő Kisokosban. Hiteles forrásból tájékozódhatsz, hiszen szakmai tartalmainkat, mind az adott terület egy egy szakértője írta. Fő témakörök, kategóriák: Vizsgálatok, Hüvelyi szülés, Császármetszés, Szoptatás, Életmód, Táplálkozás, Pszichológia, Kismama és családos pénzügyek, Cukorbetegség, Babaápolás, Előkészületek, Szüléstörténetek\r\n\nFeltölthetted az összes fontos eredményedet a Lelettárolódba, így lehetsz bárhol, bármikor megtalálod őket a telefonodban, ami biztonságérzetet ad. Ha nem érted pontosan, hogy mi szerepel a leleteken, akkor a Leletértelmezőnk segítségével könnyedén lefordíthatod magadnak a sokszor bonyolult rövidítéseket és latin kifejezéseket.\r\n\nA babavárás időszakát még olyan egyedi, hasznos eszközökkel segítjük, mint a Személyre szabható kelengye és tennivalók listája, legyen szó kórházi vagy otthonszülésről. Bármikor törölhetsz az általunk megadott listaelemekből és hozzáadhatsz olyat, ami számodra elengedhetetlen.\r\n\nA Naptárban pedig az előre beírt időpontokhoz az orvos neve mellett a majd feltenni kívánt kérdéseidet is felírhatod, hogy ne felejtsd el semmit. Illetve kapott a naptár egy kis megjegyzés részt is, ahova beírhatod az adott napon történt eseményeket például, hogy melyik nap, hogy érezted magad vagy éppen mikor rúgott először a kicsi.\r\n\nNaplózhatod az appban külön külön eszközben a Vérnyomásodat, vércukrodat és a súlykövetőnk is hasznodra válik majd.\r\n\nA Tények és Tévhitek részben pedig szakértőnk segít tisztázni a leggyakoribb kérdéseket. \r\n\nA Képeim részhez minden hónapban feltölthetsz egy egy képet saját magadról, növekvő pocakodról és pici ultrahangos fotóiról. A 9. hónaphoz érve szívmelengető lesz a folyamatos változás, cseperedés, amelyet könnyen végig áttekinthetsz az eszköz segítségével.\r\n\nSzintén kedvenceid közé fog tartozni a Kuponok rész, amiben folyamatosan frissülő kedvezményekre jogosító kódokat találsz. Partnereink között megtalálhatóak a hazai kisvállalkozókon át nemzetközi márkák és szolgáltatók egyaránt. Olyan kedvezményeket és lehetőségeket hozunk el számotokra, amely valódi financiális segítséget nyújthat a babavárás során vagy éppen még izgalmasabbá teheti ezt a várakozással teli időszakot."

You can use it for free as long as you like. It is possible to remove the advertisement for a fee, which will also enable additional features.\n\nFEATURES:\n1. A simple and powerful design: The app opens directly on the entry screen, on the most recent meal, because that is what you'll use most. The design makes adding entries as simple and intuitive as possible.\n2. One tap entry with personalized suggestions: The most common food items can immediately be selected. Starting on the second day, your recent items are suggested because you may eat the same food frequently.\n3. Logging in is not needed: No personal data or contact information is required.\n4.

Full off-line support: No need to be connected to the internet. \n6. Precise entry is also easy: You can accurately enter the precise amount using a slider.\n7. Daily reports: Using the menu, you can directly open the diary, which shows a summary of your day. Here you can switch between calories, protein and carbohydrates by pressing on little triangle.\n8. Track your goals: After entering your personal goals, you can use the week report to see your trends. \n9. Personal reminders help you stay on target: They are a convenient way to make sure you fill out your diary, after each meal, or at the end of the day.\n\nIt is a good idea to verify the information in the database is the same as the information on your food packaging; food nutrition fluctuates with brands and over time.\n\nMake sure to discuss your goals with your doctor or nutrition specialist.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES:\n1. No more advertisement.\n2. A much larger food database.\n3. The ability to e-mail yourself a copy of the diary.\n4. More configuration options, including the ability to enter up to 8 separate meals a day.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING & TERMS\nThe app is free to download and use.

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

Therefore, the hairdryer sounds and vacuum cleaner sounds helps the child calm down and feel safe. However, you don't have to carry a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner everywhere. All you have to do is download our White Noise machine which generates the noise you selected for a specified time and gently fade out at the end.

If you have trouble falling asleep, you can turn on the selected noise, set the timer and the played white noise will put your mind in a state of deep relaxation.

White noise is often used to treat insomnia, as well as for concentration, learning or studing problems.\n\nApplication benefits:\n- It helps to relax, calm down and feel safe\n- Very easy to use.

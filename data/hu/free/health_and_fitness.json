Itt megtudhatod, hogy hány nap van még hátra a babád érkezéséig, mekkora lehet a pocaklakód hossza és súlya . Ezeket az információkat a megosztás gomb segítségével egy koppintással mind megoszthatod szeretteiddel.\nSzintén a főképernyőn találod a Baba / Mama gombokat, melyekre kattintva elolvashatod, hogy az aktuális héten hogyan fejlődik a kisbabád és mi történik akkor, egyidejűleg a te testedben és a lelkedben. \n\nMEKKORA A BABA KEZE – nézd meg!   \nEgy lyoni orvosi tanulmányt felhasználva megrajzoltuk a kisbabád kezének méretét.

Ezek közül amiket már elintéztél, egy koppintéssal kipipálhatsz.\n -\tMi kerül Anya / Apa / Baba kórházi táskájába? \n -\tMit kell beszerezni a baba érkezéséig?

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.

Egy helyen fellelhető minden, amire csak szükséged lehet ebben az időszakban, legyen szó szakmai tartalomról vagy a kényelmi funkciókról. Magyarországon jelenleg az egyetlen hitelesített kismama app az Anyafalva, hiszen alkalmazásunkat hivatalosan Hiteles Egészségügyi weboldalnak/applikációnak minősítette a Hiteles Egészségügyi Kommunikációért Egyesület. \r\n\nHétről hétre követheted kisbabád cseperedését, megtudhatod mi történik vele és veled az adott héten. Széleskörű és megbízható szakmai tartalmat kapsz a fejlődési szakaszokról - amelyet a változást követő képek tesznek könnyebben elképzelhetővé és még izgalmasabbá.\r\n\nAz egyik kedvenc részed lesz Anyafalvában, hogy a gyermekvárás körüli időszak összes felmerülő kérdésére választ találsz majd a mindenre kiterjedő Kisokosban. Hiteles forrásból tájékozódhatsz, hiszen szakmai tartalmainkat, mind az adott terület egy egy szakértője írta. Fő témakörök, kategóriák: Vizsgálatok, Hüvelyi szülés, Császármetszés, Szoptatás, Életmód, Táplálkozás, Pszichológia, Kismama és családos pénzügyek, Cukorbetegség, Babaápolás, Előkészületek, Szüléstörténetek\r\n\nFeltölthetted az összes fontos eredményedet a Lelettárolódba, így lehetsz bárhol, bármikor megtalálod őket a telefonodban, ami biztonságérzetet ad. Ha nem érted pontosan, hogy mi szerepel a leleteken, akkor a Leletértelmezőnk segítségével könnyedén lefordíthatod magadnak a sokszor bonyolult rövidítéseket és latin kifejezéseket.\r\n\nA babavárás időszakát még olyan egyedi, hasznos eszközökkel segítjük, mint a Személyre szabható kelengye és tennivalók listája, legyen szó kórházi vagy otthonszülésről. Bármikor törölhetsz az általunk megadott listaelemekből és hozzáadhatsz olyat, ami számodra elengedhetetlen.\r\n\nA Naptárban pedig az előre beírt időpontokhoz az orvos neve mellett a majd feltenni kívánt kérdéseidet is felírhatod, hogy ne felejtsd el semmit. Illetve kapott a naptár egy kis megjegyzés részt is, ahova beírhatod az adott napon történt eseményeket például, hogy melyik nap, hogy érezted magad vagy éppen mikor rúgott először a kicsi.\r\n\nNaplózhatod az appban külön külön eszközben a Vérnyomásodat, vércukrodat és a súlykövetőnk is hasznodra válik majd.\r\n\nA Tények és Tévhitek részben pedig szakértőnk segít tisztázni a leggyakoribb kérdéseket. \r\n\nA Képeim részhez minden hónapban feltölthetsz egy egy képet saját magadról, növekvő pocakodról és pici ultrahangos fotóiról. A 9. hónaphoz érve szívmelengető lesz a folyamatos változás, cseperedés, amelyet könnyen végig áttekinthetsz az eszköz segítségével.\r\n\nSzintén kedvenceid közé fog tartozni a Kuponok rész, amiben folyamatosan frissülő kedvezményekre jogosító kódokat találsz. Partnereink között megtalálhatóak a hazai kisvállalkozókon át nemzetközi márkák és szolgáltatók egyaránt. Olyan kedvezményeket és lehetőségeket hozunk el számotokra, amely valódi financiális segítséget nyújthat a babavárás során vagy éppen még izgalmasabbá teheti ezt a várakozással teli időszakot."

      "label": "KnowDrugs is the easiest way to lookup drug testing results, pill warnings and drug alerts and provides you with drug info about more than 200 drugs, along with advice on harm reduction and safer use. Taking drugs always involves risks - however, if you do decide to take drugs, KnowDrugs can help you to take appropriate measures to reduce potential harms.\n\nDRUG INFORMATION & EDUCATION\n\nCheck the profiles of more than 200 drugs for educational purposes: Stimulants like MDMA and Amphetamine, depressants such as Alcohol and Benzodiazepines or psychedelics like 2C-B, LSD and DMT.\n\nKnowDrugs provides you with drug education harm reduction advice, focusing on MDMA / Molly / Ecstasy and other psychoactive substances. Knowing about the wanted and unwanted effects of drugs, their duration, interactions and risks helps you to make more informed decisions, reduce risks and reflect upon your drug habits and consumption behaviour.\n\nDRUG CHECKING, PILL WARNINGS & DRUG ALERTS\n\nSearch for drug name, substance or location, to find drug alerts from nearby and learn about their ingredients and dosage strength to avoid overdose and particularly dangerous cuts (e.g. PMA).\n\nDrug checking or pill testing is a way to reduce the harm from drug consumption by allowing users to find out the content and purity of substances that they intend to consume. This empowers users to make safer choices: to avoid more dangerous substances and combination and to use smaller quantities.\n\nIf you don't have access to professional drug testing services, looking up recent drug testing results can still help you make a more informed decision about your consumption.\n\nHARM REDUCTION & RESPONSIBLE DRUG USE\n\nHarm reduction aims to minimize the harms associated with recreational substance use. The harm reduction approach follows from the idea that substance use is a high-risk activity that innately entails the possibility of injury, addiction, and death. Therefore, the best strategy one can employ (outside of avoiding use entirely) is to take appropriate measures to mitigate its potential harms.\n\nKnowDrugs highlights the harm-potential of more than 200 substances and demonstrates strategies on how to reduce the harms associated with the consumption of drugs.\n\nKNOWDRUGS CAN ALSO HELP YOU  TO:\n\n- learn how to spot and react in case of an emergency, take care of someone experiencing a bad trip at a party or festival\n- find a free and confidential counselling service which accepts you and your personal choices, and helps you develop the right strategies and competencies if you want to change something about your consumption behaviour.\n\nNote: Always check in with your doctor in addition to using the app and before making any medical decisions. This app is not a replacement for professional medical and/or psychological help."

It is your training log for the past ten days, a combination of logged workouts and their effect on your performance.\n* Activity Status: a daily alternative to Activity Path focused on now.\n* Sneak Peek: plan active days based on today's fitness! Swipe LEFT on the Activity Path and see the predicted position for the upcoming days.\n* Yorhart, Gentler Streak character: mirrors your daily readiness.\n* Actionable Insights: expert knowledge squeezed into under-1-min reads. Relevant topics shown on Streak.\n* Workout Summaries: analyze the details of your workouts.\n* Lock Screen & Home Screen Widgets\n\nFeatures to further motivate and support you in keeping a training habit alive and healthy:\n* Training Log: complete workout history in one place\n* Progress Charts: stats that give a quick overview of your training compared with other periods and goals\n* Workout Summaries: duration, active energy, distance, elevation gain for the chosen period\n* Set Status: when sick, injured or taking a break. It removes Activity Path from sight and mind, so you can recover on your terms without feeling guilty.\n* Recaps: training month/year presented engagingly with multiple share functions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION AND TERMS\nDownload and use Gentler Streak for free.

      "label": "How We Feel is a free app created by scientists, designers, engineers, and therapists to help people better understand their emotions and find strategies to help them navigate their emotions in the moment. Conceived in conjunction with Yale University's Center for Emotional Intelligence and based on the work of Dr Marc Brackett, How We Feel helps people find the right word to describe how they feel while tracking their sleep, exercise, and health trends using HealthKit in order to spot patterns over time.\n\nFounded as a science-based nonprofit, How We Feel is made possible by donations from people who are passionate about bringing mental wellbeing to the widest possible audience. Our data privacy terms are clear and easy-to-understand: all of your data is kept on your device unless you opt-in to send an anonymized version of your check-ins to be used in research to help more people.\n\nWhether you are downloading this app in order to build better relationships, make your emotions to work for you, not against you, improve how you handle stress and anxiety or simply to feel better, How We Feel will help you identify patterns through daily HealthKit tracking and find emotional regulation strategies that will work for you. The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

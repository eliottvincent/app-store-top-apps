      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

You'll also experience cutting-edge Immersive Meditations, which blend vibrations, sound effects, and coach guidance to create a brand-new type of meditation experience.\n\nTAKE YOUR MEDITATION PRACTICE TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nGet started with our Foundations Plan, where you’ll train your focus and reduce anxiety by concentrating on your breath and noticing sensations in your body. Or, if you already meditate often, start with our Advanced Plan, which helps you take your meditation practice to the next level. As a participant in our free-year membership, you’ll also have access to our full library of 10-day personalized Plans, all our on-the-go Singles, and more.\n\nWHAT’S INCLUDED\n\n- Personalized guided meditations tailored to your mood and goals\n- 10-day Plans to help you develop your meditation skills\n- Bite-sized Single meditations you can use to get more out of any moment\n- First-of-their-kind Immersive Meditations to help you relax through a blend of vibration, sound effects, and guidance\n- Research-backed activities to help you relax and prepare for restful sleep\n- Badges to reward your progress on Plans, Singles, and skills\n- Mindful Minutes integration with Apple’s Health app\n- 10 concrete meditation techniques to build your practice: Breath Focus, Body Scan, and more\n\nIn meditation, “one-size-fits-all” fits no one.

Egy helyen fellelhető minden, amire csak szükséged lehet ebben az időszakban, legyen szó szakmai tartalomról vagy a kényelmi funkciókról. Magyarországon jelenleg az egyetlen hitelesített kismama app az Anyafalva, hiszen alkalmazásunkat hivatalosan Hiteles Egészségügyi weboldalnak/applikációnak minősítette a Hiteles Egészségügyi Kommunikációért Egyesület. \r\n\nHétről hétre követheted kisbabád cseperedését, megtudhatod mi történik vele és veled az adott héten. Széleskörű és megbízható szakmai tartalmat kapsz a fejlődési szakaszokról - amelyet a változást követő képek tesznek könnyebben elképzelhetővé és még izgalmasabbá.\r\n\nAz egyik kedvenc részed lesz Anyafalvában, hogy a gyermekvárás körüli időszak összes felmerülő kérdésére választ találsz majd a mindenre kiterjedő Kisokosban. Hiteles forrásból tájékozódhatsz, hiszen szakmai tartalmainkat, mind az adott terület egy egy szakértője írta. Fő témakörök, kategóriák: Vizsgálatok, Hüvelyi szülés, Császármetszés, Szoptatás, Életmód, Táplálkozás, Pszichológia, Kismama és családos pénzügyek, Cukorbetegség, Babaápolás, Előkészületek, Szüléstörténetek\r\n\nFeltölthetted az összes fontos eredményedet a Lelettárolódba, így lehetsz bárhol, bármikor megtalálod őket a telefonodban, ami biztonságérzetet ad. Ha nem érted pontosan, hogy mi szerepel a leleteken, akkor a Leletértelmezőnk segítségével könnyedén lefordíthatod magadnak a sokszor bonyolult rövidítéseket és latin kifejezéseket.\r\n\nA babavárás időszakát még olyan egyedi, hasznos eszközökkel segítjük, mint a Személyre szabható kelengye és tennivalók listája, legyen szó kórházi vagy otthonszülésről. Bármikor törölhetsz az általunk megadott listaelemekből és hozzáadhatsz olyat, ami számodra elengedhetetlen.\r\n\nA Naptárban pedig az előre beírt időpontokhoz az orvos neve mellett a majd feltenni kívánt kérdéseidet is felírhatod, hogy ne felejtsd el semmit. Illetve kapott a naptár egy kis megjegyzés részt is, ahova beírhatod az adott napon történt eseményeket például, hogy melyik nap, hogy érezted magad vagy éppen mikor rúgott először a kicsi.\r\n\nNaplózhatod az appban külön külön eszközben a Vérnyomásodat, vércukrodat és a súlykövetőnk is hasznodra válik majd.\r\n\nA Tények és Tévhitek részben pedig szakértőnk segít tisztázni a leggyakoribb kérdéseket. \r\n\nA Képeim részhez minden hónapban feltölthetsz egy egy képet saját magadról, növekvő pocakodról és pici ultrahangos fotóiról. A 9. hónaphoz érve szívmelengető lesz a folyamatos változás, cseperedés, amelyet könnyen végig áttekinthetsz az eszköz segítségével.\r\n\nSzintén kedvenceid közé fog tartozni a Kuponok rész, amiben folyamatosan frissülő kedvezményekre jogosító kódokat találsz. Partnereink között megtalálhatóak a hazai kisvállalkozókon át nemzetközi márkák és szolgáltatók egyaránt.

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

Megalkothatja a saját edzéstervét, vagy beírhatja edzője által írt edzéstervet, összeállíthat szuperszetteket, triszetteket, súlyzós edzés mellett végezhet kardióedzéseket - szintén hasznos tippekkel, leírásokkal, megfelelő pulzus tartománnyal ellátva, illetve nyújtógyakorlatokat is tartalmaz az applikáció képekkel, leírásokkal egyaránt.\n\n\nMILYEN EDZETTSÉGI SZINTEKNEK JAVASLOTT?\nEz az applikáció maximális segítséget nyújt a kezdőktől, akik teljesen újak az edzés világában, egészen a haladókig, ahol már különböző gyakorlatok kombinációit tudja a felhasználó alkalmazni (Szuperszettek, Triszettek alkalmazása).\nA gyakorlatok megtanulásával és a videók által nyújtott helyes, pontos kivitelezéssel könnyen válhat egy teljesen kezdő - középhaladóvá, majd haladóvá a testépítés és fitnessz világában! \n\n\nFEJLŐDÉS NYOMONKÖVETÉS:\nAz elvégzett edzéseket menti az applikáció, amit a felhasználó az edzési naptárban,illetve egy grafikonon vissza tud nézni, hogy mikor, milyen edzést végzett, hány perces volt, milyen gyakorlatot végzett, milyen sorozatszámot, ismétlésszámot és súlyt használt az elvégzett edzés alatt, illetve az elégetett kalóriákat is kiírja a rendszer, amennyiben edzés végén beírta a felhasználó az okosóra segítségével!\n\nA felhasználó a fejlődését súlyban, illetve centiben is nyomon tudja követni, ami felkerül egy kis grafikonra, így könnyedén láthatja hogy honnan indult, és hová tart.\nEmellett képeket is feltölthet az átalakulásáról (előtte-utána képek), amiket 1 kattintással később összehasonlíthat, így a nehezebb napokon motiválni fogja, hogy honnan is kezdte!\n\n\nPONTOK GYŰJTÉSE, FELHASZNÁLÁSA:\nA felhasználó az elvégzett edzésekért pontokat gyűjthet, amiket beválthat az atpp.hu-weboldalon, így az app ára csupán a használatával könnyen visszakereshető pontokban, majd levásárolható Személyre Szabott Programokra.\n\n\nELŐFIZETÉS:\nEz egy ingyenesen letölthető applikáció, ahol az első 7-napos próbaidő (Trial) ingyenes!\nEmellett az appnak vannak előfizetés nélküli ingyenesen használható funkciói is."

Taking drugs always involves risks - however, if you do decide to take drugs, KnowDrugs can help you to take appropriate measures to reduce potential harms.\n\nDRUG INFORMATION & EDUCATION\n\nCheck the profiles of more than 200 drugs for educational purposes: Stimulants like MDMA and Amphetamine, depressants such as Alcohol and Benzodiazepines or psychedelics like 2C-B, LSD and DMT.\n\nKnowDrugs provides you with drug education harm reduction advice, focusing on MDMA / Molly / Ecstasy and other psychoactive substances. Knowing about the wanted and unwanted effects of drugs, their duration, interactions and risks helps you to make more informed decisions, reduce risks and reflect upon your drug habits and consumption behaviour.\n\nDRUG CHECKING, PILL WARNINGS & DRUG ALERTS\n\nSearch for drug name, substance or location, to find drug alerts from nearby and learn about their ingredients and dosage strength to avoid overdose and particularly dangerous cuts (e.g. PMA).\n\nDrug checking or pill testing is a way to reduce the harm from drug consumption by allowing users to find out the content and purity of substances that they intend to consume. This empowers users to make safer choices: to avoid more dangerous substances and combination and to use smaller quantities.\n\nIf you don't have access to professional drug testing services, looking up recent drug testing results can still help you make a more informed decision about your consumption.\n\nHARM REDUCTION & RESPONSIBLE DRUG USE\n\nHarm reduction aims to minimize the harms associated with recreational substance use. The harm reduction approach follows from the idea that substance use is a high-risk activity that innately entails the possibility of injury, addiction, and death. Therefore, the best strategy one can employ (outside of avoiding use entirely) is to take appropriate measures to mitigate its potential harms.\n\nKnowDrugs highlights the harm-potential of more than 200 substances and demonstrates strategies on how to reduce the harms associated with the consumption of drugs.\n\nKNOWDRUGS CAN ALSO HELP YOU  TO:\n\n- learn how to spot and react in case of an emergency, take care of someone experiencing a bad trip at a party or festival\n- find a free and confidential counselling service which accepts you and your personal choices, and helps you develop the right strategies and competencies if you want to change something about your consumption behaviour.\n\nNote: Always check in with your doctor in addition to using the app and before making any medical decisions. This app is not a replacement for professional medical and/or psychological help."

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in.

We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

Talán valamilyen ételérzékenységed van, emiatt van szükséged bizonyos mentességekre. \r\nA Bocsi Viki Konyha elveinek alapját képezi a gluténmentesség, tejmentesség, cukormentesség, szója- és kukoricamentesség. Ezek a jellemzők MINDEN ÉTELÜNKRE igazak, tehát a jellemzőket nálunk nem kell keresgélned egyesével.\r\nHa van fogyási, izmosodási célod, de csak ha ha simán tudatosabban és egészségesebb alapanyagból készült ételeket enni, akkor tudd, hogy találsz az Étlapon 3 féle sort: \r\n1. Fehérjében és zsírban gazdagabb ételek - ha fogyás a célod (F)\r\n2. Jó minőségű, gluténmentes szénhidrátban gazdagabb ételek - ha izmosodni akarsz (SZ)\r\n3. Fehérjét, zsírt, szénhidrátot egyensúlyban tartalmazó ételek - ha egészségesen akarsz enni és súlyt tartani (E)\r\nÉs még ezen belül is mindhárom sor 2. opciója szénhidrátokban szegényebb. Ezeket menüben (KM) és kisadagokban, vacsoraként is megtalálod.\r\nSemmi nincs semmi kőbe vésve, nyugodtan választhatsz bármelyik sorból, amelyik éppen aznap tetszik, mert mindenképp jól jársz vele egy tudatosabb, a testedet tisztábban, egészségesebben tartó életmód irányában.\r\nFogsz találni a fentiek mellett FODMAP (FOD) sort - emésztési gondok, puffadás esetére, fogsz találni Színhúsmentes sort (HM) és Tápanyagokban gazdag sort (IM), de van Ketogén sorunk (KET), Desszertjeink (BD), és mindennap készítünk terápiás csontlevest, Alaplé (AL) néven. Mindre igazak az alap irányelveink, a mentességek.\r\nSzezonálisan változtathatunk az Étlapon vagy a sorokon.\r\nTélen 310, nyáron 350 települést látunk el, ezeket a Hova szállítunk menüpontban találod meg.\r\nMindennap 13 óráig tudod leadni a másnapi megrendelést, kivéve a hétfőt, mert annak a határideje az előtte lévő szombat 13 óra. A legtöbbet azzal segítesz nekünk, ha előre leadod a megrendelésedet egy hétre.  \r\nVárunk szeretettel az applikáción keresztül egy egyszerűbb megrendelési folyamattal!\r\nTegyünk együtt az egészségedért és a jövődért!\n\r\nBocsi Viki Konyha"

      "label": "ABOUT THE APP:\nKeeping track of what you eat has been shown to help prevent and stop over-eating.\n\nThis app helps you control your diet and eat healthier, by making it easy to track what you eat. The design is optimized to make entry as quick as possible, with 1 click entry, and recent food suggestions. The built in database already has thousands of food items and if yours are not known, adding them is easy.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: \nThis app is free to download, and supported by advertisements. You can use it for free as long as you like. It is possible to remove the advertisement for a fee, which will also enable additional features.\n\nFEATURES:\n1. A simple and powerful design: The app opens directly on the entry screen, on the most recent meal, because that is what you'll use most. The design makes adding entries as simple and intuitive as possible.\n2. One tap entry with personalized suggestions: The most common food items can immediately be selected. Starting on the second day, your recent items are suggested because you may eat the same food frequently.\n3. Logging in is not needed: No personal data or contact information is required.\n4. Thousands of items already in the database: Most food items have accurate information about common serving sizes, calories, carbohydrates, protein and fat. \n5. Full off-line support: No need to be connected to the internet. \n6. Precise entry is also easy: You can accurately enter the precise amount using a slider.\n7. Daily reports: Using the menu, you can directly open the diary, which shows a summary of your day. Here you can switch between calories, protein and carbohydrates by pressing on little triangle.\n8. Track your goals: After entering your personal goals, you can use the week report to see your trends. \n9. Personal reminders help you stay on target: They are a convenient way to make sure you fill out your diary, after each meal, or at the end of the day.\n\nIt is a good idea to verify the information in the database is the same as the information on your food packaging; food nutrition fluctuates with brands and over time.\n\nMake sure to discuss your goals with your doctor or nutrition specialist.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES:\n1. No more advertisement.\n2. A much larger food database.\n3. The ability to e-mail yourself a copy of the diary.\n4. More configuration options, including the ability to enter up to 8 separate meals a day.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING & TERMS\nThe app is free to download and use. Should you choose to upgrade, we offer a one time payment option, and an auto-renewing subscription option: Renews every three months\nPayment will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription renews automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the subscription period. There is no increase in price when renewing.\nAny unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.\nSubscriptions can be managed and auto-renewal turned off in Account Settings in iTunes after purchase. Once purchased, refunds will not be provided for any unused portion of the term.\n\nRead our full Terms of Service at http://www.ieatbetter.com/terms.html"

Athlytic even has a proprietary Effort Score on a 0-10 scale to see how far you’ve pushed yourself. It also coaches you to tell you how far off of your PR or average the Effort was for each type of workout type.\n\nNotes:\n• Athlytic does not require an Apple Watch, however for most of the features such as Recovery and Exertion Levels, you will need an Apple Watch in order to collect HRV and Resting Heart Rate Data necessary for these features.\n• Athlytic integrates with the Health App on your iPhone to retrieve the data it displays. It will request permission to access the relevant data types necessary to present the metrics and features in the app.\n\nInformation about Athlytic subscriptions:\n- Subscribers will receive 1 week free of Athlytic\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n- Your subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n- Depending on what subscription length you choose (Monthly or Annually), so long as your subscription is active, you will have access to the entire iPhone app for these periods, respectfully.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period.

The better you understand how well you are sleeping the more you are able to make changes in your routines to benefit your rest.  \n\nMy goal is to provide every Apple Watch owner with a free automatic sleep tracker that is simple and clear to understand.  For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

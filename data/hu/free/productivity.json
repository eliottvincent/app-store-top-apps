      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

Aktiválhatja és módosíthatja eAzonosítás és eAláírás PIN-kódját is, valamint megadhatja CAN-számát és azt ideiglenesen el is tárolhatja az alkalmazás segítségével. Meggyőződhet továbbá arról is, hogy okmánya rendelkezik-e szolgáltatásazonosítóval, amelynek segítségével különböző szolgáltatásokat, különösen közösségi közlekedési szolgáltatásokat (pl.: jegy- és bérletvásárlás, illetve ezek érvényesítése egyes közlekedési szolgáltatóknál) vehet igénybe.\n\nAz alkalmazás használatához szüksége lesz\n- internetkapcsolatra, \n- megfelelő NFC-térerőre (erősség), \n- arra, hogy a mobileszközben lévő NFC-chip támogassa az extended length kommunikációt, \n- iOS 13 vagy ennél újabb verzióra a mobileszközön, \n- az alkalmazás letöltésére az App Store-ból."

Back up and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

The ODB 2 car scanner will be able to notify about problems related to the car's engine and transmission, like the gearbox, clutch, or other car parts related to the vehicle's torque.\n\nOur car scanner requires an ELM 327 OBD2 Bluetooth or WiFi adapter, like Veepeak or Vgate scan adapters. Also compatible with a klavkarr diagnostic car code reader.\n\n◉ WHAT OBD 2 CAR DIAGNOSTICS SCANNER BRINGS TO THE TABLE?\n\n√ View OBD 2 engine and transmission fault codes (also known as DTCs for Data Trouble Code) and see their meaning.

This list is available for free on our website, which includes OBD2 BMW, OBD2 Audi, OBD 2 Nissan, ODB 2 Jeep, ODB Subaru and many others.\n\nIn general, all petrol vehicles produced since 2001 and diesel vehicles produced since 2004 are compatible with the E OBD Facile car scanner and ELM 327, whatever the brand.\n\nCan't find the location of your OBD 2 torque adapter? Download our App \"Where is my OBD2 port?\" Find it!\n\nThe connection with your smartphone can be done using either an ELM 327 OBD2 Bluetooth or WiFi. Our E OBD11 Facile car scanner functions with these 2 types of wireless connection.\n\nWarning: Lots of car scanners claiming to be ELM 327 compatible are sold on the internet under different names. But most of those scanners do not work properly. The connection problems with your car may come from these Chinese copies of ELM327 torque.\n\nFrom our app, you can test whether your ELM 327 has all the mandatory functionalities to provide you a quality OBDii diagnosis.\n\nIf the majority of the functions are not available during this test, it is because your ODB car scanner is defective. In this case, we invite you to contact the company which sells these ELM327: Kiwi 3, Viecar, Veepeak, Carista, LELink or Vgate scan adapter functions with our ODB2 car scanner app Torque.\n\nFor more information on our app and ODB2 car diagnostics scanner, please visit our website: outilsobdfacile.com\n\nDownload EOBD Facile and have access to the best ODB Car scanner, compatible with ELM 327 Bluetooth adapters.

Zero-log policy, traffic encryption, IP and DNS masking. These all mean that third parties are not able to monitor you any longer, and that your privacy is reliably secured from obtrusive website and ISP surveillance.\n\n+70 LOCATIONS\nOur high-speed VPN servers in 70+ locations all over the globe, as well as our enhanced KeepSolid Wise technology, allow you to freely surf the web without giving out a single piece of your personal information, including your current location. Don’t let websites discriminate you based on the way you surf the internet or the place you browse it from.\n\nTOTAL SECURITY\nWe offers a variety of VPN protocols, each with unique capabilities and strengths. Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. All costs for subscriptions are mentioned above.\n\nPrivacy policies : https://luni.app/support/vpn_privacy\nTerms of use : https://luni.app/support/vpn_terms\n\nDisclaimer: We have had reports that our VPN service might be blocked in the countries listed below:\n- China\n- UAE\n- Saudi Arabia\n- Iraq\n- Iran\n- Turkmenistan\n- Turkey\n\nWhile we can’t say that it’s totally impossible to connect in the mentioned locations, there are a few challenges to overcome."

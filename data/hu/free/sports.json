One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

You can participate with any supported exercise type, e.g. running, walking, swimming, hiking, cycling, etc.\nThe distance target of each challenge is set and we also provide a recommended timeframe within which our challenges should be completed. Users can extend their time limits to the maximum indicated at each challenge (typically up to 365 days, if not stated otherwise) if they need more time than the default setting. Users can break up the challenge targets to as many activities as they like, and can conquer the challenge at their own pace, anywhere. \n\nAccessing our challenges\nUsers can browse our challenges and create a profile on Runio free of charge. Participation on our events may require purchasing a ticket, which includes the fact that all finishers get a medal with delivery cost subject to their location (it may be free or charged). Tickets to our challenges can be purchased directly on the Runio app or on our website (www.runio.app).\n\n\nAutomatic sync with trackers or Manual activity entry\nThere are two options to complete our challenges\nA) Through automatic sync with selected tracker brands. At launch, we provide this option for Fitbit, Garmin and Strava users. The list of supported trackers will be updated on www.runio.app. If a user sets up a connection through the Runio app with their above trackers, their activities will automatically synced with Runio after the user has recorded them on their tracker and it will count against the respective challenge target.\nB) Manual entry: users can log activities manually on Runio by providing the date, time, duration, type of activity. We do not validate manually entered items separately.\nThe availability of Manual entry may be limited in certain challenges, please check the detailed challenge description of each challenge for details. \n\nTracking progress and Statistics\nRunio maps the user's progress vs the challenge target onto a virtual map with a virtual challenge route and also provides statistics about the distance, duration and number of various activity types of each user. Users also appear on a leaderboard in a challenge where they can see their position vs other users who have completed the same challenge.\n\nNotifications\nRunio provides users with various in app or push notifications linked to their activities, milestones, ranking, activity level, system or administrator messages.\n\nYour medal\nEach finisher is entitled to receive a special medal to commemorate the completion of their challenge.

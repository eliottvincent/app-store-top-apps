The app helps organisers to distribute event related information to all the participants quickly and efficiently.\n\nParticipants can be divided into different categories so that they receive information only relevant to them. For example, Media will have its own category for their specific needs (media shuttle schedule, press center opening times etc). The organising committee will have its own information available through the app and teams all the information relevant for them. In addition to specific information, all users can have results, starting times etc available through the app.\n\nParticipants need to download the app and enter a password which will take them directly to the information according to their profile. The password will be made available from the organiser.\n\nThe organiser needs to contact Sportity Ltd for the use of the app."

      "label": "Perfect companion: The SIGMA RIDE App\nDo you want to be faster, improve your endurance, keep an eye on your stats, or simply enjoy a nice bike tour? The SIGMA RIDE app is an important addition to the SIGMA GPS bike computer and the perfect companion for navigation and for achieving your personal goals! Reach and surpass your training goals. Track your speed, the distance you have travelled, your current and upcoming altitudes, the calories you´ve burned. The SIGMA RIDE app gives you an overview of all of your training, shows you your statistics, and motivates you to pursue a fitter, healthier lifestyle. Share your experiences and successes with friends and family using your social networks.\n\n\nBe there live!\nRecord your bike data with your SIGMA bike computer and analyse them right away with the LIVE screen. Have the computer display your route and current GPS position to you on the map. Distance travelled, training time elapsed, and metres of altitude uphill are also displayed, including an altitude profile. You can set your individual training views easily while you're riding or use one of the preprogrammed views.\n\n\nE-Mobility\nYou ride an e-bike? No problem: the SIGMA RIDE app is e-bike-ready. Your battery level and e-bike assist modes can be displayed on your smartphone. They can also be shown as an easy-to-read heat map, which presents data in colour and offers a better overview.\n\n\nAn eye on everything\nLook at the precise details of every tour in the activity screen. Filter according to sport types and share your activities with your friends and the community via e-mail or on platforms such as Strava, komoot, Training Peaks, Facebook, and Twitter. Record your progress and see where you have improved. Ride data such as speed can be displayed as a heat map. Various coloured fields provide a quick overview of your performance and make it easy to detect outlying values. You can also record weather data and your subjective perception of the ride.\n\n\nOff to an adventure by using track navigation and the Search & Go function\nWith \"Search & Go Navigation\", you can quickly find any location and navigate there. To do this, you can either enter an address in the SIGMA RIDE app on your smartphone or click on any point on the map. Start the created track directly on your bike computer or save it in the SIGMA RIDE app.\nYou can also import tracks from the SIGMA DATA CENTER or from portals such as komoot and Strava via the SIGMA RIDE app. The selected track can be started immediately or it can be saved on the bike computer and cycled offline at a later time.\n\n\nAlways up-to-date: \nFirmware updates for your bike computer are easy with the SIGMA RIDE app, which informs you whenever a new update is available. Then simply follow the instructions on your phone.\n\n\nCompatible devices:\n- SIGMA ROX 11.1 EVO\n- SIGMA ROX 4.0\n- SIGMA ROX 2.0\n- VDO R4 GPS\n- VDO R5 GPS"

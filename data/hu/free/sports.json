To achieve these goals, several types of exercises are available.\n\nPRACTICE\n- Free sessions to start a session quickly with or without a goal.\n- Guided sessions to reach your goals according to the different categories available.\n- You can now create your own interval session!\nThe creation of this session is based on the principle of alternating intense and moderate efforts.\nTo do this, select a warm-up, then program the duration of each action and rest phase as well as the repetitions that will constitute your session.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nView your history and performance at any time in your profile.\n\nFUN\nThe application takes control of the equipment while the athlete enjoys his favorite media on smartphone or tablet! (youtube, deezer, netflix...).\nDiscover what your practice data is like in real life!\n\nCompatible with other services: \nThe app allows you to sync with Apple Health / Google Fit\nLink your accounts with Polar Flow, Fitbit, Garmin Health, Coros, Suunto via the application settings. \n\n\nPrerequisite: IOS 10 version minimum (from iphone 5)\n\nIf you have any questions or problems, please contact us via https://support.decathlon.co.uk/fitness-and-cardio-training"

If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

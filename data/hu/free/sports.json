You receive sweet spot run training guidance that will train you to improve your performance and continually build on those gains for weeks, months, and even years at a time.\n\nThrough a combination of advanced sensor technology and an automated training ecosystem, you will be given your personalized & optimal training routine, stride-by-stride guidance during every run, and in-depth insights that help all runners, from beginners to Olympic champions, regularly push their running performance to the next level.\n\nHow to start with Stryd:\n\nNew to Stryd? This app requires the Stryd pod in order to use the app.\nAlready have Stryd? You can sign in with your Stryd account, pair your pod, and get started with the app.\n\nPerfect Pacing During Every Run:\n\nStryd accounts for your speed, slope, run form, fatigue, and wind to deliver perfect, precise, and painless pacing. This is accomplished with the Stryd pod. The pod is filled with motion & environmental sensors that comprehensively determine your running effort in nearly every running condition. With this info, you can evenly pace every run, which means you get the performance enhancing benefits from each training session — without undue fatigue.\n\nSweet Spot Training Every Day:\n\nStryd learns who you are as a runner and then prescribes daily training that is personalized to your current fitness. Next, you can import these workouts on your sportswatch and receive stride-by-stride guidance so you run at the right performance-enhancing intensity from start to finish. You stay in the training sweet spot, where you are perfectly balancing stress and rest, so that you receive the maximal benefits from each session and continue to improve.\n\nAutomated Insights That Keep You Improving:\n\nStryd analyzes and compares your similar training sessions against each other to let you know how your fitness is trending. You will know how much your recent training is paying off if you are moving in the right direction. If there is an opportunity to do better, you can quickly identify if you need to update your routine so you can keep the improvements coming.\n\nContinually Beat Your Race Times:\n\nStryd plans your perfect race for you. Stryd can account for the unique layout of your race course, the weather, the altitude, your skillset, and your overall fitness to prescribe a race plan that will ensure you perform at your peak capability. You will step up to the starting line with confidence knowing that you will run your best race possible.\n\n-----\n\nNote that, Stryd uses GPS in the background to track your running distance and pace, and continued use of GPS running in the background can decrease battery life. Stryd also integrates with the Health app in order to get access to the heart rate data from Apple Watch.\n\nAdditionally, Stryd integrates with Apple Health. This allows Stryd to automatically update your weight, access your heart rate data, and save activity data to your Health app."

      "label": "Tips Alliance: Football Betting Tips & Stats project started as a natural association between the sports experts from Tips Alliance and the best IT experts from Tipstero INC. Together we created a new computer algorithm based on artificial intelligence designed to analyze all the football matches smarter and faster. We integrated basic criteria and the computer analyzer can predict and estimate the most likely betting tips and outcomes for the top markets 1x2, double chance, over / under, BTTS / GG. The algorithm calculates all the probabilities and offers betting tips based on past statistic data, team form, head to head results, goals scored, goals conceded, odds fluctuation, team profile (attacking or defending), past playing formulas.\n\n\nAlthough the algorithm has been tested and proved to be a winning option we think human mind can not be fully replaced. The artificial intelligence can estimate the percentages for the most likely outcome based on statistics, it doesn't have access to data like injured players, weather conditions, team motivation or individual player motivation. That's where the sport experts from Tips Alliance come in to add value. After the algorithm analysis all the football games, our sport experts review all the predictions and refine them in order to obtain the best betting tips at very high win rates.\n\n\n\nADVANCED APP FEATURES\n\n• VIP Betting Tips -> Daily 2+ Ticket (accumulator) created by our professional team\n\n• Remove Ads option\n\n• Auto Ticket Generator -  that allows you to generate virtual betting tips.

      "label": "Using this app, you can register your single day or multi day fishing sessions. The sessions are grouped by year in a descending order. Each session shows the most important summary data at a glance, such as the quantity and total weight of the fish caught and also the average weight and biggest fish of the session.\n\nFor each session you can register unlimited number of catches, along with the most important data of the catch - such as fish type, weight, bait and more - and also the photo(s) of the fish. You can mark the selected catches as favorite that will then be displayed on the favorites catches screen.\n\nTap on location icon when creating or updating a Session to store the coordinates of the current location of the device on the session. These location coordinates are inherited to the Catches created for the session, however, if you are on the move, you can update the coordinates on catch level. By tapping on the active location icon either on Session or Catch screen, the location is displayed on Google Maps.\n\nIf enabled for the session, Catch Register can even download current weather conditions for each catch so you can collect valuable information for your future sessions.\n\nUse session log to track each of your rods. Using the function you can easily track which rod, bait or location is more productive. Session log can even send you notifications when a rod is due to recast.\n\nUsing fishing calendar function, you can track your fishing days on yearly and monthly level. On the monthly calendar, you can see the number of catches for each fishing day. By selecting a fishing day, the list of catches appears from which you can open the details of that catch directly.\n\nYou can easily find your biggest fish on My Personal Best screen, where all your catches are grouped by fish type and shown in a descending order based on weight.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

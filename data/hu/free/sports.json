      "label": "Ledlenser Connect enables you to remotely control and customize your Ledlenser light with Bluetooth®.  The app allows you to customize your light's settings and create custom profiles with the right light for your applications. Timers allow you to configure when the light will switch on and off. \r\n\nCompatible with MH11/iH11R, Wireless Remote Control Type A and ML6 Connect WL.\r\n\nWireless Remote Control and Direct Control: \r\nRemotely operate your Ledlenser with the Connect app or with the Wireless Remote Control Type A (if compatible). This will help you to have the correct light for any situation, even when your Ledlenser is out of reach, e.g. when hanging in the tent or under the ceiling.  \r\n\nPersonalize your light settings: \r\nUse the app to quickly and easily combine light functions that are suitable for your applications. In up to eight different profiles, you can create and store settings for your activities such as hiking, camping, DIY and working in the dark. Each profile allows you to configure up to six light features, such as light intensity, color, or additional functions such as Optisense (depending on your lamp). After sending the profile to the lamp, these features can then be set directly using the switch of the lamp – even without smartphone.\r\n\nLight at the right time: \r\nThis function allows you to define when the light switches on or off. So you can use the light to wake you up or to have the light switch off after a certain amount of time to save battery power, for example if you fall asleep. You can also choose whether the light should gradually dim as it switches off and gradually become brighter when it switches on - to wake you gently, for example. \r\n\nKeep an eye on time thanks to blinking\r\nSometimes it is important to keep an eye on time - for example during interval training or certain jobs in the dark. It helps not having to look at your watch. You can program your Ledlenser to blink after a certain period (interval) to alert you a specific amount of time has passed. The activated light thereby will be shortly interrupted. E.g. when a 10 minutes interval has been set, the light would be shortly interrupted every 10 minutes. In addition, the smart blink function can indicate the number of intervals which have passed. E.g. at a 10 minutes interval with smart blink, the light would be shortly interrupted one time after 10 minutes, then two times shortly interrupted after 20 minutes (= perceived as two times shortly blinking) and so on.\r\n\r\nBattery Status\r\nWhen connected, the Connect app will show you the current battery status of your Ledlenser in %.\r\n\nSOS function: \r\nIn emergencies, the SOS button emits an international distress signal. In addition, the ML6 Connect WL features the Alpine Distress Signal. This is for instance helpful when you’re without cell phone reception in the mountains and need the mountain patrol. \r\n\nService/FAQs/Troubleshoting:\r\nhttps://www.ledlenser.com/support/\n\n\r\nNEW FUNCTIONS:\r\nThe app contains new functions for a better user experience. New Ledlenser products are compatible with the Ledlenser Connect app."

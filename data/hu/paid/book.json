      "label": "– Who is this app for?\n\nThis app is for people who have at least a basic understanding of a foreign language and who want to drastically improve it and bring it to the next level.\n\nReading books is a great and efficient way to quickly gain and expand your vocabulary and grasp language structure and patterns.\n\nIt is a truly incredible way, used and loved by many people around the world. I can confirm it as I learned English by reading books myself and met many people who also did so.\n\n– About the app:\n\nThe app allows you to read books and translate unfamiliar words with a single tap. It is infinitely more convenient than copying every word to a separate translator app.\n\nNo need to make word cards with the words you don't know and put any effort in memorizing them. Just keep reading and whenever you encounter an unfamiliar word - translate it. After doing so for about 3-5 times you will memorize the word.\n\nYou can look up a word's definition using one of the dictionaries available in iOS and translate whole sentences and bigger pieces of text as well.\n\nIt is also possible to save translations as favourites. It can be useful for some rare or fascinating words.\n\nThe app itself is quality made and boasts a simple easy-to-use interface, high stability and performance. It has all the necessary features and settings for comfortable reading.\n\n– Available languages:\n\nYou can use the app to learn the following languages:\nEnglish, Español, Français, Русский, Deutsch, Italiano, Nederlands, Ελληνικά, Dansk, Norsk, Polski, Português, Türkçe, Svenska, Slovenčina, Suomi, Čeština, Magyar, Română, Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, עִבְרִית, 中文, 한국어, 日本語, ภาษาไทย, العربية.\n\n– Supported e-book formats:\n\nAt the moment, PDF, EPUB, FB2 and TXT e-books are supported.\nThe app is in active development and new formats are being added.\n\n– Recommendations:\n\nEven if you have just basic language skills start reading simple children's books now and after only a week(!) of consistent reading you will be amazed by the progress you've made. After a few months, or even sooner, you will be able to read fluently barely using the translation feature.\n\nAs a further step, аfter you feel like you can read freely enough, start watching movies in the language you learn with subtitles in the same language. It is an incredible way to improve your speech perception ability.\n\nYou will be surprised, but the words, phrases and language patterns you memorized will allow you to communicate with natives without any problem.\nIf you think about it, that is what children do when they learn their first language - they simply absorb language around them and then reproduce it. You can do it too.\n\n- Summary\n\nToday this incredible app makes it possible to easily master a language and it costs even less than one hour lesson with a private teacher. Don't miss it.\n\nKnowing more languages gives you a vast variety of new opportunities which can significantly improve your life. If you can start learning now - do it. You will thank yourself later :) \n\n– Support\n\nIf you have a question or an issue with the app please email me at\nbukus.app@gmail.com\n\nAlso feel free to send me your comments and suggestions. Together we can make it perfect :)"

      "label": "Written by codependency expert Melody Beattie, the Language of Letting Go provides daily guidance and encouragement for those who struggle with codependency. The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\n“CHOMP by Christoph Niemann” is the latest imagination from internationally renowned children’s author and illustrator Christoph Niemann, whose App ‘Petting Zoo’ is already loved by millions of children and families around the world.\n\n‘CHOMP’ combines playful, humorous, and lovingly hand-drawn animations with live video, enabling children and adults alike to slip into a variety of comical roles. From a virtuous pianist, to a spaghetti-slurping dog, or a living cuckoo-clock, anything is possible!\n\nWhat makes this App so inspiring and special is that children participate using their own faces, mimicry, and song, allowing their creativity to run free.\n\nWith the video functions, all of these adventures can be saved forever. ‘CHOMP’ is so easy and intuitive to use that kids can create and sing their own personal messages to send to parents, grandparents, friends, or siblings, all in the blink of an eye.\n\nHighlights :\n\n•\tHand drawn animations made with love and care.\n•\tOver 50 hand-drawn scenes with countless funny animations.\n•\tFun for all ages.\n•\tNo language knowledge needed. The app is text-free.\n•\tNo in-app purchases, invasive advertising, or data mining.\n•\tRecord play sessions with integrated video recording.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n•\tChildren can swipe left and right to change animations. Tap the screen to see the fun.\n•\tGrownups can open the camera menu in the bottom left to record videos. Tap to microphone icon to enable sound recording, use the large center button to start and stop video recording.\n•\tPlease enable camera permissions when prompted.\n\nJust as with his App ‘Petting Zoo’ and his New York Times blog ‘Abstract City’, Christoph Niemann uses ‘CHOMP’ to once again show us his own unique, absurd, and always funny view of the world.\n\nPress reviews:\n\nwired.com:\n\"It’s not quite a storybook, and not quite a video game. It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\nPlease also check out our other great App for kids:\n\n“PETTING ZOO” - is a fantastic storybook app. It features beautiful, fun, interactive animations of over 20 animals, and it’s bound to be a big favorite for kids and animal lovers of all ages.\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years.

      "label": "Nature has provided a veritable magical pantry in the plants which grow all over our planet. Since ancient times these plants have been used for magick.\n\n Through the medicinal properties of plants are fairly known- many or the most widely prescribed drugs are synthesized versions of substances originally derived from plants- their occult powers are less accessible. Much of their magick still lies in of shadow of secrecy.\n\n Our ancestors knew that plants had mysterious, magickal powers. Although the magick in herbs has been forgotten by many, it never disappeared.\n\n If you are working on a oil, or a herbal bag, and want the herb for its scent, then work out a herb that smells similar and use that.  The lists of the magickal properties for the herbs give a few options, you can use one, two, or all of those herbs if you wish to. \n\n When you pick plants, you should always thank their spirit.  Basically you are saying that you thank them for their service to you.  You should only take as much of the plant as you need, and you should never pick small plants, remember to leave enough of the plant so that it can regenerate itself  Some people like to leave an offering at the base of the tree/plant, something like a crystal or perhaps some organic matter to feed the plant.\n\n The application contains information about more than 200 herbs and their magickal use. No internet connection is required to display the items.\n\n \n Features: Over 200 plants and their magickal properties.\n   Share items with your friends via email, Facebook, Twitter or message.\n   Add items to favorites.\n   Search through the list for a specific item."

Your entire library - books, annotations, bookmarks, and all - is synced between devices via iCloud.\n\n■ PERSONALIZE YOUR READING EXPERIENCE\n\nHyphen comes packed with a ton of options for custom colors, fonts, font sizes, line heights, paragraph indentations, margins - ...well, you get the idea. You can even use styling on a per-book basis.\n\nAnd if that’s not enough, you can also add your own CSS. Cool, right?\n\n■ HIGHLIGHT AND ANNOTATE EFFORTLESSLY\n\nTap-and-drag or use the selection handles to highlight in any one of several available colors. Write notes for a highlight and refer to them any time you need to. You can also share highlights as images and post them to Twitter or Facebook, or export all your highlights  for use elsewhere.\n\n■ GOODREADS INTEGRATION\n\nUse Goodreads? We've got you covered - shelve books, make status updates and post quotes, all right from the app.\n\n■ ADD BOOKS WITH EASE\n\nAdd ePubs using your favorite cloud services - Dropbox, Google Drive, OPDS servers, and more. You can also use the in-app web browser to download ePubs, or add them using iTunes.\n\n======\n\nOTHER NOTABLE  FEATURES:\n\n■ NIGHT MODE\nTransition Hyphen's reading interface to soothing, darker colors at night.\n\n■ METADATA\nEdit the title, author, subjects, covers and more of your books. Hyphen can even lookup book covers and metadata for you.\n\n■ SHELVE & SORT\nAdd books to custom shelves, and sort by author, title, last read, or date added.\n\n■ CUSTOM CSS & FONTS\nHyphen lets you import both your favorite fonts for use while reading, as well as CSS.\n\n■ DEFINE & TRANSLATE\nTranslations of the text you're reading are only a tap away. Lookup words and terms in Wikipedia, Dictionary.com or Google.\n\n■ TWO COLUMN SUPPORT\nGot one of those large, spacious, king-sized, oh-my-lord-this-screen-is-so-big-I-should've-gotten-an-ipad-mini-instead,-its-so-big, why-is-it-so-big-sized screens? Use this setting to make reading more comfortable. You can also optionally only use two columns when your device is in landscape orientation.\n\n■ VOCABULARY\nAdd words to a vocabulary list and export them easily.\n\n■ INTERACTIVE\nTap and hold a link to open it in the in-app browser, or Safari. Images zoom in, letting you see every detail. Swipe through and jump between images throughout the text with the Image Viewer.\n\n■ ADE PAGES SUPPORT\nHyphen utilizes ADE pages, so you’ll always have a cross-reader compatible way of finding and noting where you are in a book.\n\n■ INCREDIBLY FAST\nDownload and import books in the blink of an eye. Hyphen’s ePub Rendering System is optimized so that there’s the least delay between you and the text.\n\n======\n\nCONTACT & SUPPORT\n\nNeed help or have a question?

This app supports FB2, EPUB, MOBI, PDF, DJVU, CBR, CBZ and TXT formats and offers adjustable fonts, paragraph indents, paper type and more. iBouquiniste gives you a reading experience that's as close as you can get to reading a real book, and it even lets you share your favorite books via email. Click \"...More\" to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n*** Featured In New and Newsworthy! ***\n\nDo you love to read? With iBouquiniste you'll take your favorite books wherever you go! iPad and iPhone book readers are a great innovation for busy book lovers, but they're still evolving. Some readers are so cluttered with settings and controls that you can barely read the text, while others are bare bones \"What you see is what you get\" style apps. iBouquiniste is a completely different reading experience. \n\niBouquiniste Features Include:\n* Supports notes\n* Send books by email\n* Unique Author Library (each author on their own bookshelf)\n* View most recently opened books in the order you opened them\n* Real page numbers\n* Adjustable fonts, spacing, margins, book paper and more\n* Download books via iTunes or any app supporting file transfer (i.e. Mail or Safari)\n* OPDS catalogs support\n* iBouquiniste Cloud Storage for synchronisation (books, reading positions, citations and bookmarks)\n\nThe interface is clean and easy to use. The only controls on the screen are the ones you absolutely need, but you have the control that you want to display your books exactly the way you want them. iBouquiniste supports FB2 formatted books, which is how most books are formatted. Other reader apps still don't do that. If you want an even more personal reading experience, that's not a problem. You control paragraph indentation, font face and size, margins and even the type of paper for the pages in your book. Where some apps offer sepia tones, iBouquiniste can display your book on realistic paper, with actual page numbers for each page!\n\nTired of digging through your library to find a specific book? This app gives you several ways to find any book in your collection with just a few taps. Like other, similar apps, iBouquiniste includes a complete table of contents that lists every book you own. This is a great feature if you're not sure what you want to read; but if you have a lot of books, you might spend more time looking for something to read than actually reading! That's why this app also features a unique Author's Library and a Favorites Library.\n\nIf you're in the mood to read a certain book from a particular novelist, you'll quickly find what you're looking for in the Author's Library. Each writer has their own shelf with all of their works that are in your collection. \n\nHave you ever put down a book with the idea that you would come back and finish it after you've read something else? Who hasn't done that? The problem is that when you're ready to go back and finish it, you sometimes can't remember the title of the book, or even the name of the author. Now that you have iBouquiniste, all you need to do is to sort your books with \"Recent\". This feature narrows your search by displaying the books in the order you opened them. Now you can get back to that unfinished book within just a few seconds of starting your search. Once you've finished it, why not share that novel with a friend?  It's as easy as sending an email right from the app!\n\nDon't let your book reader decide how your books should look. Spend less time searching and more time reading. Download iBouquiniste now and have all of your books at your fingertips."

      "label": "Hat Monkey is a small monkey with a hat who needs our help around the house. Young children will find the objectives satisfying as they help Monkey do everyday things they cannot yet do themselves, like turning off lights, opening the door for him, turning the pages of his bedtime book or sending text messages. They can also speak with him on the phone, and play music or simple games like hide and seek. The beautiful simplified graphics and interactions allow even the youngest children to identify what Monkey wants, to empathise with him, and learn how they can help him. \n\nChris Haughton’s award-winning books ‘A Bit Lost’, ‘Oh No, George!’ and ‘SHH!, we have a plan’ have been translated into over 20 languages around the world. Instead of adapting his books, Hat Monkey was conceived and designed from the start as a stand alone app with engaging interaction at its core.\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone. It features beautiful, fun, interactive animations of over 20 animals, and it’s bound to be a big favorite for kids and animal lovers of all ages.\n\n„NIGHTY NIGHT“ - is the perfect App for a daily go-to-sleep ritual with lovely animals, sweet music and great narration.\n\n„LITTLE FOX MUSIC BOX“ – is a sing-along songbook with more than 100 interactive elements in 3 songs and the little fox music studio where you can record your own songs.\n\nIf you experience any trouble with the App or have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us any time: contact@foxandsheep.com. We´d love to help you out. Please also mention your device version and your iOS version. Please also visit our website www.foxandsheep.com for more information and support.\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

Going much further than reading a text with illustrations; the experience has animated and interactive scenes, coupled with sound effects, careful design and an original soundtrack, all joined together to immerse yourself in the bowels of one of the H.P. Lovecraft’s most acclaimed stories in an unprecedented way. \n\nThe Colour Out of Space is considered one of the best science fiction and terror stories of all time. It was first published in the September 1927 issue of the mythical magazine “Amazing Stories”, and instantly had a great reception among fans of the genre. The Providence genius broke the established molds and presented the greatest of horrors as a simple chromatic element that lurks and threatens the protagonists of the story, something really innovative for the time when the horror stories were based on vampires, ghosts and other more conventional monsters. Perhaps for this reason, this is one of Lovecraft's own favorite stories.\n\nNow you can enjoy it in this new interactive format, and be part of the horror that stalked the hills of Arkham during the \"strange days\" ... If you dare.\n\nApp Features:\n\n• 110 pages (iPad version) / 173 pages (iPhone version) \n• Original unabridged text: no adaptations. \n• Available in 3 languages: English, Spanish and French. \n• More than 63 interactive animations. \n• 115 minutes of Interactive Original Soundtrack, composed by Miquel Tejada \n• Illustrated and directed by David G. Forés. \n• Extra content: Illustrator sketchbook and App creation processes. \n• Jump to any page of the book from the table of contents. \n• Page Memory: Return to the same page you left off from. \n• Universal App: Pay once and have access from any iPhone or iPad device. \n• Easy-to-use interface. \n• Compatible with the latest iOS features. \n• Requires iOS 8.1 or newer. Compatible with iPad 2 and later; iPhone 4s and later; iPod touch (5th generation) \n• It is recommended to have a Wi-Fi connection in order to download the application"

This app helps you to keep track of all of the books you own, have read, wish to read, have borrowed or have lent. \n\nUse this app and\n- remember all of the book recommendations you have received.\n- remember which books, in the pile of books you bought half a year back, you still have not read.\n- remember from whom you've borrowed books.\n- remember to whom you've lent books.\n- avoid reading the same book twice – unless you want to.\n- share on Facebook, Twitter.\n- send by E-mail.\n- import a book recommendation you have received by E-mail from other users.\n\nThe app is straightforward and very easy to use. When adding a book, it is up to you how much information you want to enter. The book title only or just a picture of the cover may be enough for you. But of course it is possible to add so much more information about the books, as well as the ability to enter ratings.\n\nPlease note that this is not an eReader app."

This wonderfully clever digital book app will surprise kids and grownups alike. Turkeys may also enjoy it, if they can ever figure out how to turn the dang thing on.\n\nThree earnest animals and one misguided turkey learn colors and clothes. Though admittedly, the turkey never quite gets the hang of it.\n\n“I have a particular fondness for Blue Hat, Green Hat. At age three, my son Devin had a surprisingly hearty laugh for a small person—a laugh that would make everyone else laugh. I created this book long ago specifically to elicit that belly-laugh from him. It was great fun to re-invent this book as an interactive e-book app, collaborating again with my endlessly clever Loud Crow friends. The digital dimension gave us so many terrific opportunities for adding theatrical flair to this spare yet decidedly Vaudeville book.” - Sandra Boynton\n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Blue Hat, Green Hat interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery.\n\nThe third Sandra Boynton book app, all of them created in collaboration between Boynton Moo Media along with the award-winning developer Loud Crow Interactive. Blue Hat, Green Hat follows their wonderful top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app, and the glorious bestselling Moo, Baa, La La La! app\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Touch the animals to prompt them to move and respond.\n* Touch “OOPS” to cause a different surprise on each page.\n* Tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade.\n* Dress the turkey with colorful pop-in/pop-out clothes\n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations, and also added new touch-animations\n* Wonderful resonant and wry narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer\n* Includes a original sounds and soundtrack, “William Mattel Overture,” a melody for toy crank-guitar, written by Sandra Boynton, performed by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book\n* “The Big Guy Reads It” narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” to hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

Purity is the force. Utility is the principle. Books are the basis.\n\nFollowing inspiration from so many wonderful Sannyasis and senior devotees, and with permission from the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Dancing Ganesh is privileged to able to present an exclusive program which gives you access to 13 of Srila Prabhupada's books at your fingertips. Just imagine, wherever you travel, in your lunch breaks, giving class, being asked a challenging question, you could have the answers with you in your pocket, beadbag or handbag.\n\nThis is our way of serving Srila Prabhupada's mission of spreading Krishna Consciousness throughout the world. Therefore, the cost of the package containing 13 books has been kept to a minimum. A small amount to pay in return for the most incredible teachings from Srila Prabhupada.\n\nDancing Ganesh has had enormous pleasure in creating this software and owes full gratitude to the continued support of ISKCON devotees.\n\nCOPYRIGHT NOTICE FOR THE INCLUDED BOOKS\n\nThis is an evaluation copy of the printed version of this book, and is NOT FOR RESALE.

First published in 1890 with the help of more than one hundred colleagues, Strong's remains the most widely used concordance and dictionary of Bible words from the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nThis updated edition of Strong's Exhaustive Concordance takes James Strong's monumental work and updates it to be even more useful to the modern reader. It maintains all of the features that have made Strong's indispensable for over 100 years: \n- Allows the reader to easily find all biblical occurrences of a word in the King James Version\n- Points the reader to the underlying Hebrew and Greek words\n- Uses the Strong's numbering system which is used in many of the new study tools of today \n\nAnd adds new features that make it even more useful: \n- Corrected, updated, and expanded using the latest computing search tools\n- Extra-clear font and page design make this edition readable and easy to navigate\n- Updated and improved Hebrew and Greek dictionaries tie each word to the Greek or Hebrew root\n- Discover the Hebrew and Greek words underlying the KJV English using the Strong's numbering system\n- Use the updated Hebrew and Greek dictionaries to find brief definitions of each word of the original languages\n\nGo beyond mere searches for lost verses and hone your skills by utilizing this tool's more advanced features.\n\nFind every occurrence of any word in the King James Version Bible. Only the words not likely to be used in locating a passage have been eliminated (words such as should, those, and when) or condensed to include only the important occurrences (words such as bring, day, and might). \n\nStudents of the Bible utilize the wealth of resources offered in Strong's ranging from doing word and thematic studies to probing the deeper meanings embedded in the original languages of the Bible."

You have to buy and swallow words to be able to pronounce them. And words are expensive, especially the really good ones.  So Paul collects words he finds on the street: „Cherry, Dust, Chair“. He wants to give them to Marie, to show her how much he likes her.\n„The great word factory“ talks about the world of words and the power of language. And the fact that in concerns of the heart, it doesn’t always matter what you say but rather how you say it. The two children, Paul and Marie, are the best example for that.\n\n\nAwards\n \n-      GIGA Maus 2014\n-      Leipziger Lesekompass 2014 of Leipzig Bookfair and Stiftung Lesen\n-      Pädagogischer Interaktiv-Preis 2014\n-      Children’s media award „Der weiße Elefant“ 2014  \n-      Among the best children’s book apps 2013 at BesteKinderApps.de\n-      Among the best book apps 2013 at Kirkus Reviews\n\n\nPress\n \n-      „A sweeping declaration of love for the power of words, the world of reading and the value of language – a joy for the whole family to be looked at again and again.“ (RBB Kulturradio)\n-      „This picturebook app inspires a love for literature.“ (DIE ZEIT)\n-      „Very poetic.“ (ZEIT Wissen)\n-      „A playful and mindful approach to language is creatively put into pictures and interactions! A wonderful story of friendship, full of emotion and imagination.“ (Leipziger Lesekompass 2014)\n-      „The subtle illustrations and the calm atmosphere of the app fascinate children and adults alike. Enchanting!“ (Eltern family)\n-      „A highly recommended app leading children into the imaginative world of language again and again.“ (DJI – Deutsches Jugendinstitut)\n\n\nHelp\n \nWe want you to enjoy the story of Paul and Marie without limitations. Thus we are there for you, should there be any technical problem despite all our efforts.

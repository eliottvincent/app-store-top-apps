      "label": "Do you enjoy watching videos on your iPhone? Do you hate not being able to because your iPhone cannot support the video format? Or do you hate the inconvenient and time-consuming hassle of trying to convert video formats to fit into one that your iPhone can support? \nThis is why the AVPlayer was created. The AVPlayer can play almost any computer video file format such as AVI, Xvid, WMV and much more clearly and effortlessly. No converting hassles. Just copy files via USB and just drag and drop into the AVPlayer’s Media Explorer. \nThe AVPlayer can also support external subtitle files such as SMI and SRT. So if you enjoy watching videos on your iPad, then the AVPlayer is an absolute necessity. \n\n• Support Formats\n- Dolby Digital (AC3), Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3)\n- Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- MP4,MOV,M4V\n- XVID,AVI,WMV,RMVB,ASF,H264,MKV… most of all movie file formats. \n- SMI, SRT, TXT, SubStationAlpha Subtitles \n\n• Post Processing \n- High quality video processing \n- Contrast,Saturation,Brightness \n- TV-Out \n\n• Control the playback speed (From 0.5X to 2.0X) \n- User setting support \n- Sweep to the left : move to backword 10 sec \n- Sweep to the right : move to forward 10 sec \n- Sweep to the top : 1.5X speed \n- Sweep to the down : normal speed \n\n• Additional features \n- Rotation Lock / Aspect ratio:auto/16:9/4:3/Full screen \n- Folder Management:Pass code/Move/Rename/Create \n- Resume play from last position \n- Scrubbing search \n- supports e-mail attachment by \"Open In\" feature \n\n• USB/WIFI Transfer \n\n• Note \n1. How to add video with USB \n- Run iTunes 9.1 or above \n- Device->My Device(My iPad)->Apps, drag and drop files to the AVplayer's documents \n\n2. Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal."

Make yourself, friends and family bald, then send them a video/photo of their comb-over via Skype, Viber, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, MMS, YouTube, Email, Gmail, and more.\n\nEven combine Old + Beard + Fat effects when you also have Oldify, Beardify or Fatify installed on your device!\n\nMAKE BALD FRIENDS!\nIt's hilarious :)\n\nJoin us: @apptly on Instagram / Twitter\n\n\nGo bald with style."

Use in app purchases to unlock the others, or save almost 50% when you purchase the 4-pack!\n\nDazzle your friends when you roll into the parking lot with the sound of a lumbering muscle car.\n\nEach engine realistically delivers the thrill of driving a different type of supercar.\n\nUses Hollywood quality recordings of the real engines to sound totally authentic.\n\nTune the performance of your engines by adjusting the shift point and gear ratios.\n\nSound like you are burning out your tires and drifting without driving recklessly.\n\nSupports both cabled and wireless Bluetooth audio connections to your car stereo.\n\nAutomatic Mode measures the acceleration of your car and Manual Mode lets you control the engine by hand.\n\nXLR8 works well with any device, but works best with a GPS.\n\nDrive the car of your dreams – XLR8\n\nWhen using XLR8 with a Bluetooth audio connection, you may experience latency."

      "label": "You’ve discovered the Original and World Famous iFart® App.  An Apple All-Time TOP 20 App.  The definitive Fart Sounds app on iTunes.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nFeatured on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The Today Show and many others, iFart® is considered the most infamous app of all time. \r\n\r\nAlso seen in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, MSNBC.com, MacDailyNews, MacForums, The New York Times, Barron's, Motley Fool, Gizmodo, Venture Beat, Ars Technica, CNET News, Geek.com, Forbes, The UK Register, Information Week, TechCrunch.com and dozens of publications all over the world!\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\niFart® took the app world by storm in 2008. It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away. When the Sneak Attack goes off, slip away or take out the bad guys when they reach for their noses.\r\n\r\n* RECORD-A-FART *\r\n\r\nThere are special moments in life that just have to be captured on your phone to be believed. \r\n\r\nThe birth of a child, a stunning sunset, bigfoot, and of course, the after effects of a triple burrito lunch.\r\n\r\nUsing iFart’s \"Record-A-Fart\" feature you can now make audible memories for a lifetime and play them for friends and family. Plastic wrap optional.\r\n\r\n* FAVE FARTS *\r\n\r\nUsing our FAVES feature you can create a playlist of your fave farts for easy access. You can also record and rename multiple farts which are stored in the FAVES list.\r\n\r\n* BLAST *\r\n\r\nIf only there was an internationally recognized sound that alleviates stress, brings laughter, lowers blood pressure, clears a room, helps bring peace to the middle east and is enjoyed by both Democrats and Republicans.\r\n\r\nWell Folks... just hit the BLAST button and let the healing begin. \r\n\r\n\r\n* BONUS FART PACKS*\r\n\r\niFart includes EIGHT of our funniest Fart Packs, each pack contains up to 10 fresh cuts for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\n* Jurassic -  Ever wonder what a Dinosaur fart sounds like?.\r\n\r\n* Presidential -  Joe, Kamala, Bernie, Hillary, & Donald let em rip!\r\n\r\n* Fart Wars - May the Flatulence Be With You\r\n\r\n* Movies  - In a world without gas… this is a land that prays for a hero.\r\n\r\n* Bands  - The bands on the runs with these farts.\r\n\r\n* Food  - You can't have dessert until you play all these farts.\r\n\r\n* Shart Toppers   - Music Parody Rips \r\n\r\n* Celebrities  - Sorry Kanye, you didn't make the cuts.\r\n\r\nHey, you read this far!    \r\n\r\nWe've added a bonus fart to our wheel called \"Fart-O-Rater\".  \n\nMake sure you play it and while you're laughing leave us a review and let us know your what your favorite fart or fart pack is today!"

      "label": "Get ready to rescue baby dinosaurs with Blaze and AJ in Blaze’s Dinosaur Egg Rescue Game!  \n\nThis iPhone app exposes preschoolers to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) concepts as they travel through Dino Valley with Blaze and AJ to find lost dinosaur eggs.\n\nThroughout the adventure, children are encouraged to develop problem-solving strategies and complete physics-based puzzles using water, bouncy balls and lasers to rescue dinosaur eggs from dangerous situations. Each location contains between one to three eggs, along with a hidden prehistoric gem!\n\nTOOLS: To rescue the dinosaur eggs, children are encouraged to manipulate the following tools and simple machines:\n-\tWheels\n-\tPulleys\n-\tCranks\n-\tLevers\n-\tMirrors (static and rotating)\n-\tSolar panels\n-\tPendulums\n\nCONCEPTS: In addition to experimenting with different tools, children are exposed to the following STEM concepts:\n-\tHeight (e.g. moving Blaze up or down to reach certain locations)\n-\tWeight (e.g. adding objects to a  bucket connected to a pulley)\n-\tTrajectory (e.g. manipulating the path of water, bouncy balls or a laser)\n-\tAdhesion (e.g. using a “sticky patch” to trap items and construct a path to complete the puzzle)\n\nHANDS-ON APPROACH TO LEARNING\nThis educational iPhone game for kids fosters a hands-on, experiential approach to STEM learning through critical-thinking challenges that enhance children’s understanding of physics puzzles and how things work. Kids learn with the help of their best friend Blaze - the coolest truck from the popular Nick Jr TV show!\n\nADDITIONAL GAME FEATURES\n-\t3 Blaze transformations – Blaze can shoot water, bouncy balls, or laser beams!\n-\tExplore three locations in Dino Valley and navigate different types of terrain – the jungle, rocky plateaus and a volcano!\n-\t45 levels – Solve forty-five physics puzzles to locate over 80 dinosaur eggs and a prehistoric gem on every level! \n\n\nBlaze and the Monster Machines Dinosaur Rescue collects personal user data as well as non-personal user data (including aggregated data).

Disguised as a simple “Doodle” program, iForce is lurking inside, unseen and undetectable. Everything is examinable, which adds to the mystery. \n\niForce is the ONLY magic product that lets you create on-the-spot custom tricks that you perform instantly.

      "label": "Now all you iPhone-using munchkins can get an unfair, yet completely legal, advantage when you play Munchkin or Munchkin Quest!\n\nThe Level Counter keeps track of your level (duh). It also rolls a six-sided die (and doesn't cheat). But best of all . . . once per game, you get a Boon . . . an in-game advantage to help you kill the monsters, steal the treasure, and stab your buddy. There are almost 150 different Boons, all illustrated by John Kovalic. The higher your level when you ask for your Boon, the better it's likely to be. And when you reach the winning level, it plays a fanfare. Your friends will hate you . . .\n\nBonus features include:\n• Kill-O-Meter screen to keep track of combat scores.\n• Counters for Chez Geek and SPANC (Space Pirate Amazon Ninja Catgirls) illustrated with art from the games.\n\nThis app is NOT a stand-alone game! It is a game aid for the Munchkin card games and Munchkin Quest board games by Steve Jackson Games. Munchkin is the dungeon experience . . . with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff.

It was the first comic reader in the App Store, it’s still the best. \n\n• Organize your collection how YOU want. Put series inside series, use dividers to manage long lists.\n• Automatically sorts comics into their series.\n• Super fast reading view with two-page mode and assisted panning.\n• Page position lock so you don’t see the same borders page after page.\n• Does the right thing when you rotate your device, many comics have a mixture of portrait and landscape pages.\n• Lightning fast search, by comic title and tags.\n• Parental lock for individual series.\n\nIN APP PURCHASES\n\nFor a very reasonable price you can also unlock\n•  Comic Finders, create smart series that show you unread comics from all over your library.\n•  Seven new, gorgeous themes.\n\nCOMIC IMPORT \n\n• WI-Fi using a web browser on a PC or Mac.\n• Drop Box, iCloud Drive, etc using iOS document sharing.\n• AirDrop from a Mac.\n• iTunes via USB or Wi-FI\n\nTHE SLIDER\n\nComic Zeal features the innovative slider, it's a pointer, a container and a toolbox, all in one.  You can push stuff into it, then go anywhere in your collection and drag it out.  It's an incredibly fast way to organize your comics.\n\nWith the slider you can:\n\n• Reorder comics, put them into the slider in the order you want them, then drag them out.\n• Create reading lists (by making copies of comics that don't take up any space on your device)\n• Create series and dividers right in the app.  Dividers are lists that can hold comics, series and even other dividers.\n\nTIPS\n\n• Tap the ‘i’ info icon for comics, series and dividers. You can rename entries, sort a series or mark items as read or unread.\n• When zooming, hold the gesture for half a second.  Comic Zeal will lock that zoom and position when you turn the page, it's a great way to hide borders.  \n\nComics used in the screenshots:\n'Escape from Planet Nowhere',  © 2010 Otis Frampton, http://planet-nowhere.com/\n\nPlease note, there is a problem with Google Drive’s iOS extension that doesn’t allow you to open comic and other files that they consider to be ’non-standard’.  You can read more about it here: https://goo.gl/EKVRbN and here https://goo.gl/XXYRQI . You can open Comics from the Google Drive app itself using the 'Open in ...' option, just not directly from Comic Zeal."

You take out your phone and launch Magic Lie Detector. The app asks a series of questions from the spectator regarding her card. She can lie or tell the truth completely up to her. After every question, the app scans her finger and successfully decides if she is telling the truth or lying. For the final scan, ​the spectator places both her fingers on the phone and the app tells exactly what card she has chosen.\n\n* Custom options *\nMagic Lie Detector is a 100% customizable app. Whether you want to add some extra questions to the basic effect or create a completely new routine of your own, it doesn’t matter, it is ALL POSSIBLE with Magic Lie Detector.\n\n* Quick Facts *\n- Learn in 3 minutes\n- Easy to perform\n- Amazing reactions\n- In your pocket all the time\n- Fully customizable\n- So much fun!"

After that application uses the built-in GPS to check your current speed. When it reaches 88 MPH application  plays some sounds and switching the \"Present Time\" to your \"Destination\" - like you just jumped over the time. Application \"come back\" automatically after several seconds. \nPlease note and take this VERY SERIOUS -speed of 88 MPH is ILLEGAL on the MOST of the public roads. Double check this before your experiments and always keep the safety. \nThis feature will not work well on iPods and not-3G iPads - the real hardware GPS chip is required.\n\nOn the \"Time Distance\" screen you can see the number of seconds, minutes, hours, days and weeks between Present and Destination time. This screen is available by tapping the \"DIST\" label.\n\n \n\nYou can change the \"Destination TIme\" by tapping the screen slightly above or slightly below the digits. Keypad to enter the Destination time available on tap on the Destionation time numbers. Enter \"05\" for March, \"06\" for June, etc. \"0\" and \"1\" sets the AM/PM time.\n\nThanks to everyone for your suggestions about additional functionality, there is a big chance they will be implemented in next release. Please forward your requests to support@atoll-ordenadores.com email address."

Unlike other magic apps, this trick is not performed on the magician's phone, so the spectator will not assume that a tricky app is involved. City Prediction is a pure miracle performed on the spectator's iPhone in his/her hand. It is so unbelievable it will leave the audience speechless and amazed.\n\n= The effect =\nThe magician asks for the spectator’s iPhone and asks her to open maps.google.com in her browser. After the performer turned it away for a few seconds, he puts it face-down on the table. From this point, nobody will touch the phone but the spectator. First, ​she names a city - it is completely free of choice, no lists or restrictions are involved. Then she turns her iPhone over and surprisingly realizes that the city she named is marked in the previously opened Google Maps.\n\nThe trick is easy to perform, requires minimal setup and practice. The app includes written instructions and a video guide, as well.\n\n= Facts =\n- Works with any iPhone or iPad\n- NO voice recognition used\n- NO force used \n- NO pre-show used\n- Spectator can name virtually ANY city in the world\n- Nothing is installed on the spectator’s device\n- City is marked in Google Maps\n- A brand new method never used in magic before"

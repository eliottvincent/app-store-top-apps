      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

The magician does not touch the cards.\n. The spectator counts the cards and turns the last one itself.\n.

If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\r\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\r\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\r\n\r\nWe will update and improve Real Drift constantly. Please rate and give your feedback for further improvement of the game.\r\nFOLLOW US\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Real-Drift/788082697884714"

Play with friends or strangers in online play, challenge the AI, or play offline with friends face-to-face! \r\n\r\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t​he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens. \r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\r\n\r\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\r\n\r\n- Featuring original art by The Oatmeal\r\n\r\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\r\n \r\n- Digital versions of the hit expansions, including Streaking and Barking Kittens, as well as digital exclusive Betrayal and Party decks\r\n\r\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\r\n\r\nCreat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\r\n\r\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money.

After you apply for a job as the barista of Papa's Mocharia, you learn that a year-long film is being made about the coffeehouse -- and you're now the main star!  Under the watchful eye of the documentary crew, you'll be brewing espresso, steaming and frothing milk, and crafting eye-catching layered drinks for your picky customers.  Work your way through the holidays as you serve seasonal coffee and cannoli, unlock new ingredients, and earn Daily Specials with delicious latte and macchiato recipes.\n\n-- GAME FEATURES --\n\nBREW ESPRESSO AND LAYER DRINKS - Use the Brew Machines to make freshly-brewed shots of espresso, and to steam and froth milk for the customers' drinks.  On the Build Station, you'll layer the espresso and milk into a large cup along with colorful powders and flavored syrups, creating a delicious layered latte that looks as great as it tastes!  Complete the drink with toppings, whips, and drizzles for that finishing touch.\n\nCRAFTING CANNOLI - Customers will order a custom-made cannoli along with their Papaccino drinks.

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

      "label": "Here is the long-awaited successor to our critically acclaimed flight simulator. It simulates the Space Shuttle approach and landing in incredible detail and accuracy. \r\n\r\nThis is a remaster of our original F-Sim Space Shuttle, completely rewritten from scratch. New features include:\r\n- Console quality graphics\r\n- Interactive tutorials\r\n- White Sands as a third landing site option\r\n- Orbit mode\r\n\r\nF-Sim Space Shuttle combines realistic flight simulation with stunning graphics and fun gameplay.\r\n\r\nYou’ve never landed a Space Shuttle before? We’ve got you covered: Included are several tutorials with varying degrees of autopilot assist. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again.\r\n\r\nEach flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: Because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. After your first safe touchdown, chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different wind conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles.\r\n\r\nYou control the Orbiter’s pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks or use a gamepad. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we’ve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they’ll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it’s your turn to give it a try.\r\n\r\nA new orbit mode lets you take the Orbiter for a spin around the planet, and we’re working on a full atmospheric re-entry scenario, which, among other new features, will be released as free updates in the coming months.\r\n\r\nThere are no ads or in app purchases, and we don’t collect any personal data."

      "label": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

It is also very hard, and I love it for that.” ***\n84/100 – PC Gamer\n \n***”It evokes lot of the more demanding thrills that modern games have left behind, the grit and the hard won satisfaction of overcoming intimidating challenges, or the experimental fun of spending hours tinkering with all the different ways you can play through a big, open-ended level. I had a blast inching my way through pretty much all of the harder stages in this game and I also think you might have a blast with it too.” ***\nSuper Bunnyhop\n \n“It’s a thing of beauty and manages to capture the planning and satisfying execution of more complex strategy games, as well as the gung-ho and the popping-off of growly man in military shooters. (...) It’s probably the best man-shootery game I’ve played in years.”\nIndie Statik\n \nDoor Kickers mixes old school, no-quarter action with modern ergonomic interfaces and puts you in command of a SWAT team during a tactical intervention.\n \nAnalyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.\n \nIt may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps and losing no people, that’s a skill harder to master.\nQuick Points:\n§ 80 single missions, 6 campaigns and unlimited gameplay via mission generator\n§ Over 65 weapons and gear items to use and overcome the enemy.\n§ Top Down perspective  for optimal tactical analysis\n§ Real Time With Free Pause\n§ No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces\n§ Realistic but action packed\n§ Non-linear levels, freeform gameplay\n\nWebsite https://inthekillhouse.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/KillHouseGames\nTwitter - @inthekillhouse"

      "label": "A Tactical Wargame that allows you to command thousands of soldiers as a Union or Confederate General during the Battle of Gettysburg. The strategy game features unique hand drawn map, complex morale, innovative controls and smart AI. \n\nUltimate general: Gettysburg is a critically acclaimed indie wargame with one of the highest user ratings for strategy games on Steam and Metacritic. \n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n==============\n\n**Campaign\nThe campaign is split into 10 historical missions from the first engagements to the famous “Pickett’s charge”. Missions present different levels of complexity that will give you hours of gameplay. \n\n**Unique Controls & Unit Self-Awareness\nThe game plays in real time, but you can pause at any time to plan your strategy and give orders to units. Drag simple movement arrows to command large forces as if you are drawing them on the tactical map. Units do not need micromanagement, able to act on their own: re-aligning, switching targets, withdrawing and forming battle lines without player input.\n\n**Smart AI \nThe AI commanders are able to evaluate and gain tactical superiority in real time, reacting to your actions; fighting aggressively or defensively replicating actions of a competent human player. The game will provide the significant challenge on higher difficulty levels.\n\n**Detailed Map of Gettysburg\nWe used satellite images and historical maps, recreating important locations, houses, ridges and hills that are depicted as accurately as possible within the game’s unique art style. If you are an American Civil War enthusiast, you will be happy to notice the amount of precision and information that the map provides. Not only will you be able to better understand the historical layout of the map, but also you will be able to use of each location and landmark in battle, thanks to the simulation of cover, concealment, terrain and high ground in the game.\n \n**Advanced Line of Sight\nElevation and obstructions will affect unit visibility realistically. Units will use concealment and cover to survive artillery barrages, stage ambushes and more, but beware – the AI will attempt to do the same. \n \n**Tactics matter\nIn Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you will realize that army units are not “machines” that blindly follow orders, but need to conserve strength and courage for decisive battle actions. Every basic tactical element that is expected from a strategy game is important for winning battles. Unite morale is affected by multiple factors including flank or rear attacks, casualties, volley shocks, artillery fire and fatigue.\n \n**Historically Accurate Forces and Leaders\nUltimate General: Gettysburg includes the full order of battle for the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Command famous brigades like the Iron Brigade, Louisiana Tigers, 1st Vermont, Bucktail Brigade, Gibraltar Brigade, Excelsior Brigade and many more.\n\n**Differences with the PC version\nThe game was redesigned from the ground up to provide good usability and playability on tablets. If you have played the game on the PC, the major change is in the campaign flow and in the user interface. The tactical combat and its features were tuned only slightly. You will be able to experience the same depth and challenge on iPad. \n\nRetina display ready"

On the cards we find questions and tasks, answering them we can learn more about ourselves and each other.\n\nThis game will help you to:\n- learn more about yourself\n- connect more intimately with others\n- find your life task\n- discover new pleasures\n- be more confident in yourself\n- realize your desires\n- take control of your life\n- develop your communication skills\n- gain basic insights into your life\n- make your life more fulfilling, happier, and more balanced.\n\nThis is an adaptation of the Identity board game that you can purchase for a fraction of the price of the original one and you can also try it for free with a limited set of cards!\n\nIn this game:\n- 290 task cards lead you through the path of self-knowledge\n- 5 types of action cards make the gameplay more exciting,\n- offers a meaningful activity for 2-6 people,\n- can be played in Hungarian, English and German.\n\nWhy is it good to discover yourself?\n\nTo get the most out of life, it's useful knowing your talents, abilities, desires, goals, and values. The game will help you find your inner treasures through 7 types of tasks.\n\n- The Happiness cards help you recreate your ability to experience joy and to do something just for the fun of it.\n- The Creation cards can evoke the creative powers of thought and imagination. They help you formulate your desires, achieve your goals and find your life's purpose.\n- The Love cards contribute to raising awareness of your relationship with others as well as their relationship with you. They also help strengthen your most important relationships.\n- The Soul Power Cards strengthen your self-confidence and self-esteem.\n- The Resolution cards will inspire problem solving in different areas of your life.\n- The Wisdom cards can provide opportunities to learn from others.\n- The Feedback cards will help you see your blind spots through the eyes of your fellow players.\n\nThis game provides guidelines for an exciting, deep conversation. When you answer the tasks that are presented to you, you will gain self-knowledge. You will also get closer to yourself as well as each other. This game is not about crowning a winner, however, if you are able to work in a spirit of trust, respect, and care, every single player will win whenever they play.\n\nMost of the tasks are light and playful, it is a pleasure to talk about them and listen to each other. However, there are also tasks that require deeper self-examination and self-discovery. It’s not easy to go through them, talk about them, and listen to each other. But know that if you are brave and honest, you are setting an example and encouraging others to show more of themselves. \n\nAs you solve the tasks, you will find puzzle pieces - smaller, bigger - that will slowly show a picture of your life. This game is used to put together the defining outlines of the image of your life. \n\nYou can continue to play the game multiple times. If you do the \"Advice \" tasks - as an out-of-game homework - you can bring the changes from the theoretical level, from the level of intellectual understanding to the practical level, and they can become part of your life, your realizations can lead to lasting improvements to your life.\n\nYou play with your loved ones - your family, your friends - or maybe unknown people, and you notice that the game brings you closer together. Above all, however, you play with yourself and come into contact with the hidden, undiscovered parts and resources of your personality. \n\nIdentity Psychological Board Game is a perfect entry into the world of self-knowledge and self-development. Be brave to immerse in yourself!"

The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift).

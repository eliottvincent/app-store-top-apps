It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

      "label": "SafeExamBrowser (SEB) is a secure kiosk web browser environment used to carry out e-assessments that run on exam servers. SEB opens a web browser without an address and search bar, loads a pre-configured webpage and locks an iPad (or iPhone or iPod Touch) into a single app kiosk mode. This mode prevents students from switching to other apps, accessing websites and communicating with other students during an exam. SEB enables secure exams on unmanaged iOS devices like students' own iPads as well as on iOS devices owned and managed by an institution. SEB doesn't use a centralized server or cloud service; it can be configured with an API, config files and config links. It can be used with most web-based quiz and e-assessment systems. For improved security and usability, some exam systems provide additional built-in support for SEB. Currently, SEB integrates especially well with learning management systems (LMS) such as Moodle, ILIAS, OpenOLAT and with several non-commercial and commercial exam systems, such as Inspera Assessment, Dugga, Exam.net or EvaExam.\n\nSEB uses one of the single app modes provided by iOS. After an exam is submitted, SEB can automatically end the app self-lock kiosk mode (an exam invigilator could also use a quit password to end the SEB exam session and unlock the device if necessary). \n\nSEB features an optional Dock displaying buttons for various commands. Instead or in addition, a left slider menu shows a list of open browser tabs and commands which can be used to (if enabled in settings) quit an exam session, jump back to the start page of an exam, reload a web page or search text on it, and navigate back/forward in the browsing history. \n\nSEB for iOS uses the same format for encrypted .seb configuration files as the SEB versions for other platforms. Those config files allow to individually configure SEB to display the start page of an exam system or an exam portal page with a list of links to current exams. If SEB for iOS is installed using a mobile device management (MDM) system, its initial configuration can easily be deployed using the \"MDM Managed Configuration\" feature. You can also directly start an exam with an individual configuration in SEB for iOS using a special config hyperlink. This link can be opened by examinees from Safari, Mail or a messenger app. In addition, you can use QR codes containing SEB links. An exam can directly be started in SEB by using the iOS Camera app or the built-in QR code scanner. \n\nSEB also works together with Apple Classroom, teachers can start individually configured exams on all student devices. See https://safeexambrowser.org/ios for more information.\n\n\nSafeExamBrowser for iOS was developed by Daniel R. Schneider, ETH Zurich, Educational Development and Technology (LET), based on the original idea of Safe Exam Browser by Stefan Schneider, University of Giessen\nProject concept: Thomas Piendl, Daniel R. Schneider, Damian Büchel, Andreas Hefti, Dirk Bauer, Michael Kern, Kai Reuter, Tobias Halbherr, Karsten Burger, Marco Lehre, Brigitte Schmucki, Oliver Rahs.\n\nSafe Exam Browser is released as freeware. The code is subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may only use these files in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/ .\n\nImportant parts of this project have been carried out as part of the program \"AAA/SWITCH – e-Infrastructure for e-Science\" led by SWITCH, the Swiss National Research and Education Network and the cooperative project \"Learning Infrastructure\" (part of the CRUS program \"Information scientifique: accès, traitement et sauvegarde\") coordinated by SWITCH, and was supported by funds from the ETH Board and the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI)."

      "label": "PROGOS app is the next generation AI-based English speaking test. Now available to instantly assess how well you can speak English!\n\nTest results can be measured from Pre A-1 to B2 High in the CERR standard.\n\nFor example, you may have measured your ability to listen and read English, but you have never diagnosed whether you can actually speak English properly. Or, you may be worried about communicating in English. To address these issues, PROGOS was created a test to measure speaking ability based on practical business English conversation situations.\n\nThe content of the PROGOS test is focused on English used in business situations, such as interviewing, expressing opinions, making presentations, and interacting with people to get work done. This test assesses not only your knowledge of English, but also your ability to communicate in a practical way. \n\nThe test results are displayed with extensive feedback to help you with your continued studies. This app stores your test history, so it's a great way to see how your skills improve over time. The test takes about 20 minutes, and the test results are scored in around2 minutes after the test is completed. \nThis app allows you to conveniently check your business English speaking skills!\n\n■Overall evaluation of PROGOS\nThe Common European Framework of References for Languages (CEFR) places a great deal of importance on \"What can I do with the language?\". Therefore, the overall evaluation of PROGOS takes into account the six qualities of speech (range of vocabulary, accuracy, fluency, interaction, coherence, and phonology) as well as the degree to which communicative objectives are achieved. It is not a simple sum of vocabulary and pronunciation assessments, but a measure of practical communication skills.\n\n■Analytical Evaluation\n6 analytical aspects defined by the CEFR.\n\n(1) Range\nKnowledge of grammar, sentence structures, vocabulary, and phrases.\n\n(2) Accuracy\nCorrect use of grammar, vocabulary, etc.\n\n(3) Fluency\nFluent and smooth speaking.\n\n(4) Interaction\nAbility to start, end and / or maintain a conversation.\n\n(5) Coherence\nOrganization of speech and logic.\n\n(6)Phonology\nIntelligible pronunciation, intonation and stress.\n\nThe following are also included in the feedback sheets:\n・ The Can-Do descriptor of the CEFR level result.\n・ General feedback and advice on how to improve speaking skills by one level.\n\n▶PROGOS Strengths\n\n■Convenience\nA 20-minute test that can be taken anytime, anywhere online. It is easy to sign up and results are returned quickly.\n\n■Complete everything on your phone or other device. \nOnline diagnosis without worrying about time or place. The test is automatically scored by AI, so you can take the test anytime, anywhere, 24/7. Once you launch the app, you can take the test and check the results almost instantly online.\n\n■Evaluation using the global standard, the CEFR\nOverall speaking assessment according to CEFR-J levels (the Japanese version of CEFR with subdivisions) six analytical aspects of spoken language use by the CEFR.\n\n■Detailed Feedback\nA feedback sheet that not only shows skill assessment, but also provides suggestions on what and how to learn, in order to support the test takers' learning.\n\n■Test history storage\nEach time you take a test, your test history will be stored. By using the app to repeat the cycle of learning and assessment, you will be able to check and see the improvement of your English speaking ability, making it useful tool for more effective English learning."

With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal. Or, see the full picture in browse, where you can find all of your health and wellness data.\n\nLearn more about Google Fit and see a list of supported apps at: https://www.google.com/fit"

First, white noise creates sleep sounds and helps replace a bedtime fan. That's because sleep sounds like fan noise, rain, fire sound can easily mask disruptive environmental noise canceling out traffic or blower noise. As a result, you'll stay relaxed for longer. In addition, white noise boosts your concentration. That's because white noise reduces distractions. So if you're looking to improve your focus, our white noise sleep fan app may be worth a try.\n\nWHITE NOISE BABY FOR A BETTER SLEEP\nAs any parent knows, getting baby to snooze through the night could be challenging. But did you know that white noise baby actually helps them more than a sleep fan? According to research from SleepIQ, white noise and brown noise puts babies to snooze for longer periods of time. Just like adults, babies are sensitive to outside noise. One way to create good type of blowly ambiance for them is with a sound machine. There are many different types of sound machines on the market, so get one that best suits your needs for a better sleep. You can also get sleep tracker apps that can produce white noise but they're not always guaranteed to work. And if you're worried about the volume, sound machine usually has an adjustable volume control, emitting the right amount of fan sound running through the sound machine at the perfect levels for the bedroom.\n\n12+ FAN NOISE TO CHOOSE FROM\nThere are a variety of ways to achieve calm. One popular method is to use a white noise or brown noise machine. These devices & apps project calming sleep sounds just like a bedtime fan - getting you to snooze faster. Another option is to use a physical bedtime fan. The gentle flow of air is soothing, helping you drift off into slumber. Finally, some people find that box fan noise helps them fall asleep faster. The constant hum of box fan is calming and provides a sense of security, making it easier to drift off into dreamland. With little experimentation, you'll be on your way to achieving a better sleep.\n\nSLEEP TRACKER\nSleep trackers are also extremely important for our overall health and well-being. A sleep tracker with fan noise will keep track of how long you snoozed, how many times you woke up and more. This information is helpful in determining the changes you need to make while increasing your sleepiq. Another thing you should do is to invest in a sleep fan. Bedtime fan will help create fan noise and a soothing, cool environment that is ideal for a relaxing night. And finally, one more thing for snoozing off to sleep sounds and waking up refreshed is to use blowly or a blower. Blower helps keep your airways clear and prevent snoring.\n\nAlso, always make sure your bedtime routine includes winding down for few minutes before and activating a sleep tracker. This could involve reading, listening to brown noise, relaxing music, or using a bedtime fan or blower to create a soothing ambiance. Finally, consider investing in a quality pillow, sleep fan (that'll create a relaxing ambiance) and a mattress to ensure you're as comfortable as possible when you sleep. You can also purchase a box fan as it's gaining popularity lately. By following these tips you'll wake up refreshed.\n\nDownload the easy white noise generator now and have a good night sleep! \n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nReach out to us if you have any questions at: help@appsavvy.ca"

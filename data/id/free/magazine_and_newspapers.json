      "label": "So verpasst Du als Fußballfan kein Fußballspiel mehr!\n\nHast Du Dich schon mal geärgert weil im Fernsehen Fußball gezeigt wurde und Du erst in der zweiten Halbzeit eingeschaltet hast? Das passiert Dir mit dieser App nicht mehr. Hier findest Du alle Termine an denen Fußball live im Fernsehen gezeigt wird.\n\nDieser Kalender zeigt die Fussballspiele an, die live im deutschen Fernsehen, also z.B. auf ARD, ZDF, RTL, SAT1, Kabel1, Sport1 etc., aber auch im Pay-TV bei DAZN, Sky Sport, Sky Sport Bundesliga, MagentaSport und Eurosport Player gezeigt werden. Ausserdem werden auch die Spiele aufgelistet die im Livestream gezeigt werden, z.B. vom DFB oder LaOla.\n\nHier finden sich Bundesliga und DFB-Pokal-Spiele sowie die internationalen Auftritte in der Champions League und Europa League von Bayern München, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig, Bayer 04 Leverkusen, Borussia Mönchengladbach, VfL Wolfsburg und Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nAuch die internationalien Partien der Champions League mit Teams wie Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Manchester City, Manchester United, FC Liverpool, Paris St. Germain, Juventus Turin und vielen mehr.\n\nDie Länderspiele der deutschen Nationalmannschaften (A-Team, U21, U19 etc.) werden natürlich ebenfalls berücksichtigt wie Zweite Bundesliga und auch Dritte Liga. Last but not least werden natürlich auch die Spiele des Frauenfussballs angezeigt, national wie international.\n\nMit der neuen Version 2.0 haben wir die App komplett neu geschrieben und viele viele neue Funktionen hinzugefügt. Unter anderem folgende Features sind nun vorhanden:\n\n- 4 verschiedene Listenansichten. Wollt ihr nur Text? Oder lieber Grafiken? Wir haben beides, in unterschiedlichen Kombinationen.\n\n- Favoriten. Definiert aus über 400 Teams Eure Favoriten und verschafft Euch mit nur einem Klick einen Überblick über Eure Spiele.\n\n- Filter. Ihr habt kein Sky? Oder interessiert Euch nicht für Freundschaftsspiele? Setzt die entsprechenden Filter und diese Spiele werden Euch nicht mehr angezeigt.\n\n- Suche. Ihr wollt nur die Spiele eines bestimmten Tages sehen? Oder schnell nach einem bestimmten Verein suchen? Kein Problem mit der Suchmaske.\n\n- Teilen. Wenn Du mit Freunden ein Spiel schauen willst schick ihnen doch einfach eine Info zu dem Spiel direkt aus der App. Per WhatsApp, Mail, etc.\n\n- Kalendereintrag. Du kannst mit einem Klick einen Kalendereintrag in Deinem persönlichen Kalender erzeugen damit Du Deine Spiele nicht verpasst. Natürlich mit Alarm rechtzeitig vor Spielbeginn.\n\nDu kannst alle diese Funktionen in den ersten 2 Tagen kostenlos testen. Danach wird die Benutzung eingeschränkt und Du kannst nur noch die Termine von heute und morgen sehen, außerdem sind die Zusatzfunktionen wie Filter, Suchen, Favoriten etc. gesperrt. Um alle Termine zu sehen und alle Funktionen nutzen zu können brauchst Du eine Abonnement. Zur Zeit bieten wir eine Jahreslizenz für 4,99 € sowie eine 3-Monats-Lizenz für 2,99 € an. Jedes Abonnement hat vorab einen kostenlosen Testzeitraum von 7 bzw. 3 Tagen. Innerhalb dieses Testzeitraums entstehen Dir noch keine Kosten. Falls Du das Abo nicht innerhalb des Testzeitraums kündigst wird der Betrag von Deinem iTunes-Konto abgebucht. Das Abo verlängert sich automatisch um den gleichen Zeitraum wenn Du nicht spätestens 24 Stunden vor Ablauf kündigst. Diese Informationen findest Du auch in unseren Nutzungsbedingungen unter https://fussballimtv.de/impressum.html#nutzungsbedingungenapp .\n\nWICHTIG: Ihr könnt die Spiele hier NICHT schauen! Es handelt sich um Programmhinweise für die TV-Sender in Deutschland. Ihr könnt Euch dann die Termine in den Kalender eintragen damit ihr die Spiele nicht verpasst. Natürlich erhaltet ihr hier aber einen Hinweis wenn die Spiele von dem TV-Sender auch im Internet als Stream gezeigt werden."

Hi-Files is published 6 times a year and is also distributed in surrounding countries like Montenegro and Bosnia. Our objective is to increase circulation and page volume, thus following the development of audio/video market in Serbia and surrounding markets with the emergence of new distributors and appearance of new brands. We cover events, news and educational articles, but most of the magazine consists of reviews of the newest and popular Hi-Fi and Home Theater equipment. Hi-Files has a international character. We have written reports from the most important European Hi-Fi shows. The name of the magazine by itself suggests that content is internationally oriented. \n\nEven though we are young magazine, our goal of leading a market in the right direction is most important. Therefore we are organizing the Hi-Files Show, an event for bringing equipment closer to the consumer. Hopefully, the show will bring companies from surrounding countries and become a traditional event.\n“Hi-Files joined EISA in May 2008 with a lot of joy for our stuff, but also our readers. This step is very important to us in a political way, because Serbia is putting an effort in becoming member of EU. For Hi-Files, joining EISA brings more authority and closer cooperation with colleagues from European countries.”\n\n==================================\nThe magazine offers a yearly (4.49€/4.99$) auto-renewable subscription \n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase \n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n\n==================================\nThis magazine is proudly powered by PressPad.\nPrivacy Policy: https://presspadapp.com/terms-apps/\nTerms of Use https://www.presspadapp.com/terms/"

All the camera information and control settings are well aligned on the screen.\n· DUAL mode: recording video with two cameras working at the same time. Recorded in one file as Picture in Picture or two files.\n· PORTRAIT mode: with iPhone Pro and iPad Pro's LiDAR sensor and the devices' powerful processors, you can record \"portrait mode video\" with real-time blurred background.\n\n# COLOR\n\n· LOG: it's not only a genuine LOG gamma curve -- we strictly matched your mobile device's color to the industrial standard - ALEXA Log C.\n· Cinematic Looks: we provided a dozen of cinematic looks for filmmakers -- the styles are categorized into Neutral Styles, Film Emulation (classic Kodak and Fuji cinema film), Movie Inspired (blockbusters and indie masterpieces), and ALEXA Looks.\n\n# ASSISTANTS\n\n· Monitoring tools: Waveform, Parade, Histogram, RGB Histogram, Audio Meter.\n· Composition assistants: Aspect Ratios, Safe Area, Thirds, Crosshairs, and 3-axis Horizon Indicators.\n· Exposure assistants: Zebra Strips，False Color, Exposure Compensation, Auto Exposure.\n· Focus assistants: Focus Peaking and Auto Focus.\n· Recording: Record Beeper, Record Flash, Volume Key Record.\n· Zooming and Focusing: A-B Point.\n\n# DATA\n\n· Frame Rate Normalization: Mobile devices don't have perfect frame rate control, therefore, it's easy to get non-standard variable frame rate. Protake solves this problem fundamentally and makes strictly constant FPS of 24, 25, 30, 60, 120, etc.\n· File-naming: All the video files saved by Protake use the standard naming system: Camera Unit + Reel Number + Clip Count + Date + Suffix. It's something like \"A001C00203_200412_IR8J.MOV\"... Sounds familiar?\n· Metadata: Everything including device model, ISO, shutter angel, white balance, lens, connected accessories, location, are all well recorded in the file's metadata.\n· Time code: We provided both options for you -- Free Run and Record Run. It's compatible with your cinema cameras.\n\n# Protake+\n\n· With a Protake+ membership, you can use all the features, including: Pro mode, LOG gamma curve, Protake Cinematic Looks, all the assistant tools, data management, 3rd-party accessories.\n· Protake+ provides 1-year membership for you to purchase;  \n· Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase;\n· Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period;\n· Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period;\n· The renewal price for 1-year membership is USD 19.99.\n· You can manage your subscription and switch off the auto-renewal by accessing your Account Settings after purchase;\n· All personal data is handled under the terms and conditions of Protake’s privacy policy.

Does what it says. And gives great results.\" by mazmac747\n\n\"Tested with 2 images that took up 18 Mb reduced to 0.68 Mb and clear.  Works great.\" by Capt Jack Sparrow POTC\n\n\"Absolutely brilliant Application that speedily compresses your photos for storage, sharing and export. Thanks!\" by Rebsolar\n\nSAVE SPACE ON YOUR iPHONE\n\nAre you plagued by the “Storage almost full” alert on your iPhone or iPad? If so, this app can help! \n\nUse Compress Photos to shrink the file size of photos and regain storage space on your device. When applied to all your pictures, Compress Photos can help you store up to 10 times more photos on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nKEEP IMAGE QUALITY SHARP\n\nCompress Photos is easy to use but it is incredibly powerful. \n\nThe intelligent compression engine allows you to reduce the file size of photos without reducing their quality. With two compression settings to choose from, Compress Photos can easily shrink photos by 90% or more without a notable difference.\n\nEASILY LOCATE COMPRESSED PHOTOS\n\nCompressed photos are saved to both your main library and a dedicated album conveniently called “Compressed Photos” on your device, allowing you to easily locate processed pictures. This new album is automatically created when you run the app and save compressed photos to your device.\n\nSUPPORTED FILE TYPES\n\nCompress Photos works with all PNG, JPEG, HEIF, and HEIC image files.\n\nBEFORE AND AFTER SAMPLES\n\nBefore: 2.3MB — After: 207kb (91% smaller)\nBefore: 4.1MB — After: 492kb (88% smaller)\nBefore: 4.8MB — After: 384kb (92% smaller)\n\nFor best results, we recommend setting both compression settings to 80%, which should significantly reduce the file size without a noticeable difference to the naked eye. \n\nPRO VERSION\n\nUpgrade to the Pro version of Compress Photos to remove ads, and compress more than 3 photos at once. \n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and will auto-renew at the same price every year, unless canceled in your iTunes account settings at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings after purchase.\n\nTerms of use: https://www.sixstarapps.com/terms/\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.sixstarapps.com/privacy/"

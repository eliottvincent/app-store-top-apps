      "label": "The most complete, flexible and versatile calculator for professionals in the oil and gas industry!\n\nNow optimized for iOS 12 and above. \nNewly added features: \n- Calculator for Aromatics\n- Added the following tables to the oil conversion screen: table 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 52, 56, 57, 58\n- Added a field for density correction in the main calculator (and quantity editor) for the calculation of special applications in case a thermal expansion coefficient is not available\n- Viscosity / pour point / flash point blender\n- LNG density calculator\n- Viscosity / Temperature calculator\n- Density data for both the LPG and LNG density calculator are stored in the phone for easy retrieval\n\nThe app uses the ASTM tables / formulas to calculate weights and volumes based on entered density15, density20, relative density or API, observed volume, pressure and temperature, and calculates the following:\n- Volume correction factor (to number of decimals of your own choice or as set by table Version)\n- Metric tons (vacuum)\n- Metric tons (air)\n- GSV (M3 @15)\n- BBLS (@60)\n- Longtons\n- Gallons\n\nOilCalcs contains both ASTM 1980 and ASTM 2004 tables (including updates 2007 and 2009) as well as the ASTM 1952 version of LPG Table 54, and users can select which table to use in the settings screen. Users can also select whether they want to calculate using SI Metric units or Imperial units.\n\nPrecision for VCF, GSV, MTons, LTons and Bbls can be changed using the settings screen. Settings are saved in the app so that when you use the app next time it will calculate with your chosen settings.\n\nDensities can be entered in the following formats which are automatically recognized:\ne.g 0.9664 / 966.4 / 9664\n\nThe app can calculate for crude oil, black and white products, lubrication oils and special applications, and input can be changed between density in vacuum at 15 and 20 deg C/ API / relative density / observed, and degrees Celsius / Fahrenheit by touching the applicable buttons.\n\nThe user has the choice to calculate using as input observed M3 / M3 at 15 / observed Barrels / Barrels 60 / Metric tons air/vac / Ltons / Gallons.\n\nThe user can also calculate weights of LPG / NGL, using either density @ 15C, relative density @60F, observed density or density @ 20C.\n\nAside from the conversion screen with conversions between API, observed density, density 15, density 20 and relative density, there is also a screen with conversions used in LPG / NGL.\n\nFor products, lube oils and crude there are two tools for calculating final density when blending two components: one tool that calculates the blend after loading the 2nd component, and another tool that lets the user choose the two components and advises which component to load first, based on density 15C or API 60F and actual temperature of the components. Both tools also calculate volume shrinkage due to blending.\n\nA utility has been included that enables the user to export data from the calculator screen directly into a database for future reference. The same utility can be used to enter data manually and edit previously entered data.\n\nFor a detailed tutorial please visit our webpage (http://mooringmarineconsultancy.wordpress.com)."

Update, modify and maintain your contacts easily and conveniently on your computer using Excel, OpenOffice or any other Excel-compatible application.\n2. SA Contacts sends all of your contacts to you from your iPhone in a convenient zip file by email, USB, or through a webpage seen only on your local wifi network! Contact photos are sent, too!\n3. Never again rely on iTunes as your only local source of back up. Nor do you need to share your contacts with Yahoo or other websites in order to have a backup.  SA Contacts' zip file contains ALL of your contacts in a convenient, easy format.\n4. SA Contacts protects you from iTunes sync accidents which can delete your contacts if, for example, you no longer have access to an Exchange server.\n5. Restoring or changing contacts from the spreadsheet is as simple as uploading the file to your phone via USB, email or web. It couldn't be easier.\n6. You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14. You can remove all iPhone contacts or groups before importing your organized contacts. \n15. SA Contacts can support 30,000+ contact entries.\n16. All column headers and labels in the Excel file are localized.\n17. Export/Import contacts to/from a VCF file.\n18. Backup contacts before import.\n19. Manage groups easily. You can now create, edit, delete groups and add contacts to groups.\n20. Export an Excel file with all photos included - this makes the contacts in your spreadsheet look better.\n21.

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "This application offers a unique approach to project management, which represents your project not just as a plan, but as a coordinated mechanism moving towards the goal. \n\nThe original technique allows you to break down project objectives into smaller goals, processes and resources, but not get lost in the details, but always see the overall structure of the project as a whole. After all, project management is not a mechanical observance of the plan, but the achievement of project goals, which should not be overlooked.\n\nThe application combines the classic project approach based on Gantt charts and project management through workflow diagrams. As a rule, Gantt charts are ideal for presenting project schedules, but they are not so convenient for reflecting the complex structure of the relationship between processes, goals and resources.\n\nMore formally, the program allows you to build a customized, based on the BPMN notation, PERT diagram of the project (with events and processes at nodes). Then this description of the project is used to generate a Gantt chart and track the progress of the project. \n\nSo, inShort is a powerful project and business process management tool, which can be applied not only in office but also for personal purposes.

But it is not guess work. \n\nThe essential aspects of SEO can be addressed relatively predictably and mechanically if you understand how search engines work and appreciate that search engines are not some magical entity - search engines are rating a site based on what information is available to them on line. Simple.\n\nThe SEO-Keywords app aims to take care care of this mechanical predictable nature to unburden business owners, digital marketing managers and SEO practitioners, and save time and effort.\n\nOther tools are good (but expensive), but however quite often loose focus, can be clumsy, and are not easy to use or mobile first so just not handy for fitting SEO into busy business owner’s schedules. \n\n  * * * * *\n\nWhat is SEO?\n\nThere are two broad sources of digital information that help search engines to optimally find businesses against keywords and these can be optimised - this is SEO!\n\n1. Your Website \n\n2. Wider community Information (published articles, referrals, social media etc - these are all known as back-links)\n\nSEO-Keywords concentrates on the Website: Here information is grouped as “on-page” (what people can see), “off-page” (such as head meta tags) and technical “structured” (such as page load times, type of server, age of site, host quality, responsive, broken links ….).\n\n  * * * * *\n\nWhat are Keywords?\n\nYour campaigns, branding and aspirations define how you want others to see your business and hence what to be found for, particularly in a digital first approach. You are maybe striving to be known as the \"best car valet company in Milwaukee” - if so, your site needs to say this and keywords you want search engines to associate the website with in this instance maybe:\n\n- car valet Milwaukee\n\n- best car valet\n\nEtc …..\n\nSo firstly: you need to decide what your keywords and phrases are.\n\n   * * * * *\n\nHow does SEO-Keywords help?\n\nSEO-Keywords determines how often keywords appear and where: for example if they appear in your “Title\" meta-tags they they are deemed more important than in plain \"p\" paragraph text.\n\nIf you were to do this manually it would be quite error prone and take hours. Using the SEO-Keywords app it is repeatable, predictable and takes seconds.\n\nIf you want some advice , send me your URL and can show you how to use and how it can help!\n\n  * * * * *\n\nNotes:\n\n(1)  Please note Apple devices do not support downloading from unsecured, non-HTTPS enabled sites.

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor.

      "label": "- A \"must have\" orthopedic app pick by Orthopedics Today\n\n- Rated a \"Top App\" by TopOrthoApps.com\n\n- An MDLinx Editor's Pick\n\nOrtho Traumapedia is designed to provide quick access to information important to the treatment of adult skeletal trauma. Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

      "label": "ObWheel is a handy app that puts the traditional pregnancy dates wheel into the palm of your hand! ObWheel is useful for expectant parents as well as obstetricians, family physicians, nurses, midwives, and students. It uses the date of Last Menstrual Period (LMP) to calculate Estimated Due Date (EDD) and Gestational Age (GA). No more imprecise paper wheels - this tool is always at hand, in your pocket!\n\nWe've separated the outer and inner wheels to make this easy-to-use. Spin the green wheel to set the LMP date. Spin the purple wheel to browse important milestones, and to calculate the gestational age on a specific date (displayed in the middle).\n\nPrefer to enter dates manually? No problem. Select \"Set\" and choose dates by LMP, EDD, or GA on a specific date. Use the \"Info\" screen to see important dates (trimesters, testing and windows) and information on fetal biometry reference ranges (Lessoway) based on current gestational age.\n\nNeed to calculate the EDD from a dating ultrasound report? Rotate the purple wheel until the GA shown matches the GA on the ultrasound report. Then, rotate the green wheel until the date matches the date of the ultrasound. The EDD will be displayed below. Alternatively, input the GA and ultrasound date manually in the \"Set\" screen.\n\nObWheel is a universal app and works on the iPhone and iPad! We are continually working to improve ObWheel, and appreciate your feedback."

      "label": "Simple, fast, yet more thorough than any other pregnancy wheel available for the iPhone, Perfect OB Wheel is better than just a replacement for your trusty paper wheel.\n\nHere's why Perfect OB Wheel is your best choice of gestational calculator:\n\n 1) Input flexibility: Start with one of:\n    • Last menstrual period (LMP)\n    • Conception date\n    • Estimated date of confinement/delivery (EDC)\n    • Ultrasound dating: Number of weeks and days gestation as of a given date (\"X Weeks\").\n\n 2) Input speed: Other wheels for the iPhone make you conform to them for entering your patient's information. Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

With the touch of an iPhone the user is easily able to track their month to month progression. This easy-to-use program is suitable for scoliosis sufferers of all ages. Its high degree of accuracy makes this application suitable for professional such as Doctors, Chiropractors or Physiotherapist and simple enough for personal use at home.\n\nThe device proves much safer than x-ray technology and can be used in between doctor’s visits to track one’s individual condition.\n\n“With ScolioTrack, the patient can track the curvature in the spine from month to month by using the iPhone accelerometer, just as a doctor would with a scoliometer,” said Dr. Lau. “A scoliometer is a device that measures objectively the severity of a scoliosis. And so it is with ScolioTrack.”\n\nThe technology tracks the patient’s Angle of Trunk Rotation (ATR), which is a key measurement in screening and planning for the Health In Your Hands approach to scoliosis treatment. ScolioTrack also tracks a person’s height, weight and photo record of a persons back, both beneficial for growing teenagers or health-conscious adults with scoliosis. \n\nScolioTrack saves all the information in one convenient location and provides touch of the finger retrieval for future checkups.  An easy-to-read display shows data output in graph format for ease of tracking changes over time and the new technology is capable of saving and tracking the data of multiple users. With ScolioTrack’s access to the latest breaking news regarding the condition, and its user-friendly support guides, patients can gain an effortless handle on their disorder.\n \nFEATURES OF PROGRAM: \n• Simple, attractive, elegant interface.\n• Safer and more affordable than x-rays.\n• Can be used with multiple users and saves their data conveniently on the iPhone for future reference.\n• Tracks and saves a person’s Scoliosis Angle (ATR), a key measurement in screening for and planning treatment of scoliosis.\n• Tracks a person’s height and weight, ideal for growing teenagers with scoliosis or adults who are health conscious.\n• Check your results and Scoliosis changes in beautiful history graph.\n• Camera function takes a photo of the person’s back to notice any changes to the back visually such as rib humps, hip protrusion, body alignment or spinal deviation and compare it easily with previous photo records.\n• Displays the latest news feed on scoliosis to keep users informed and up-to-date.\n• Comprehensive database of frequently asked questions about scoliosis.\n• Full help and easy to follow guides so anyone can track their scoliosis in the comfort of their own home.\n\n-----------------------------------\nABOUT DR KEVIN LAU\nDr. Kevin Lau's ScolioTrack is one element of his comprehensive \"Health In Your Hands\" series for a natural, non-surgical, highly effective and proven method for reversing scoliosis. The other elements include his best selling books \"Your Plan for Natural Scoliosis Correction and Prevention\" and \"An Essential Guide for Scoliosis and a Healthy Pregnancy\" which has been translated to 9 languages and an exercise DVD for scoliosis, \"Scoliosis Exercises for Prevention and Correction\". He is a recipient of the \"Best Health-care Provider Award\" by the Straits Time and featured on TV prime time news."

(Home, work, daycare, etc.  Want to add Grandma's house?  You can easily add custom locations.)\n\n* Milk Maid keeps track of individual bottles and bags by pumping date so that you can use the oldest milk first.  Milk Maid is flexible.  You can combine milk from multiple pumping sessions or pour milk from one bottle into multiple bottles and freezer bags.\n\n* Record the bottles and bags used by you or your caregiver each day.  Have a business trip?  Milk Maid will calculate the average milk you used last week to help you estimate how long your stash will last.\n\n* Set an expiration period for each storage location and Milk Maid will track the expiration time of each bottle/bag in your stash.  Browse the stash to see containers that are nearing expiration or expired.\n\n* Use Milk Maid's optional features like the handy timer if your pump does not have one and the Left/Right feature to track each side separately.\n\n* Milk Maid supports oz or mL or both.  Milk Maid remembers which units you used last so you don't have to keep entering it over again.\n\n* Browse and edit your entire history of pumpings and feedings.\n\n* Quickly and easily browse your entire inventory of fresh and frozen milk in multiple locations.  See the total volume stored in each location.\n\n* Export all data in CSV (spreadsheet) and RTF (word processing) format via email or wifi to share with your caregiver or healthcare provider."

In just ONE app there is 1) a gestational age calculator, 2) an ultrasound biometric calculator, 3) a fetal weight calculator, 4) a list of key weeks and trimesters, 5) an age-adjusted risk table for trisomy 21 and aneuploidy, 6) a BMI calculator, and NOW 7) an Apple Watch app is included with your purchase!\n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 is a state-of-the-art gestational age calculator (also known as an obstetric or pregnancy wheel) that is used every day by doctors, obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and pregnant women. The OB Wheel Pro 7 is a professional tool that replaces the need for multiple apps and it greatly enhances the functionality of those worn-out cardboard wheels without compromise. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 accurately determines the estimated delivery date (EDD), or due date, of a pregnancy based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or from the date of conception, or from a known gestational age (GA) on a known date, e.g. from an ultrasound measurement, or from fetal biometry like Crown-Rump Length (CRL), Femur Length (FL), and BiParietal Diameter (BPD). Additionally, for appropriate gestational ages, The The OB Wheel Pro 7 estimates fetal weight and displays the number of days completed and remaining. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7, besides calculating GA from fetal ultrasound biometrics, enables clinicians to also calculate Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) from FL, BPD, Head Circumference (HC), and Abdominal Circumference (AC) using the most appropriate published reference formula using the maximum and most appropriate parameters.\n\nPrenatal care providers know that there are key gestational ages where testing or interventions are needed. The OB Wheel Pro 7 lets providers see at a glance when these items should be scheduled.\n\nFEATURES\n• Includes Apple Watch app! \n• Gestational Age Calculator from LMP, EDD, Conception Date for any reference date\n• Gestational Age calculated from specific date and gestational age (e.g. ultrasound)\n• Gestational Age Calculator using fetal biometrics (CRL, FL, BPD)\n• Fetal Weight Calculator using HC, AC, FL, BPD\n• Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator\n• Age-Adjusted Risk Table for Trisomy 21 and aneuploidy\n• List of key completed weeks during pregnancy\n• Pregnancy days completed and remaining, and dates for each trimester\n• Remembers last-used EDD\n\n\nPRO TIPS: \n• To enter Gestational Age, CRL, FL, or BPD for a specific date (like for an ultrasound exam), tap \"Today\", enter the desired date, then tap on the button displaying the gestational age to change that button to display options for entering a specific GA, CRL, FL, and BPD. \n• When using the GA calculator, double-tap a date to change the value to the current date.\n• When using the EFW calculator, double-tap a value to clear the value of the selected parameter."

The model is based on data derived from women found to have at least one adnexal tumor that was judged not to be physiological, underwent a standardized ultrasound examination, and was later selected for surgery. \n\nThe ADNEX model contains nine predictors: age, serum CA-125 (U/ml), type of center (oncology vs other), maximum lesion diameter, proportion of solid tissue, number of papillary projections, the presence of >10 cyst locules, acoustic shadows, and ascites. An oncology center is defined as a tertiary referral center with a specific gynecological oncological unit. \n\nThe model was developed by clinicians and statisticians from the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) group, and is based on clinical and ultrasound data from almost 6000 women recruited at 24 centers in 10 countries (Italy, Belgium, Sweden, Czech Republic, Poland, France, UK, China, Spain, and Canada).\n\nA full description of model development and validation is given in Van Calster B, Van Hoorde K, Valentin L, Testa AC, Fischerova D, Van Holsbeke C, Savelli L, Franchi D, Epstein E, Kaijser J, Van Belle V, Czekierdowski A, Guerriero S, Fruscio R, Lanzani C, Scala F, Bourne T, Timmerman D. Evaluating the risk of ovarian cancer before surgery using the ADNEX model to differentiate between benign, borderline, early and advanced stage invasive, and secondary metastatic tumours: prospective multicentre diagnostic study.

This valuable method is now available to all healthcare professionals via this application, having been previously limited to the few who were prepared to put the time and effort into understanding the detailed Stewart’s equations. Even when familiar with this method routine use at the bedside was limited by the complicated, time consuming formulae. In contrast, in a matter of seconds this application will generate results for the following:\n\n1) Acid-Base Status\n2) Individual Ion’s Effect on Base Excess\n3) Apparent Strong Ion Difference\n4) Effective Strong Ion Difference\n5) Strong Ion Gap\n6) Gamblegram\n7) Anion Gap\n8) Corrected Anion Gap\n9) Osmolar Gap\n\n\nThis application improves patient care by enabling the healthcare professional to quickly identify an acid-base disorder and initiate timely therapy directed towards the underlying cause.

It is also registered by the Australian Medical Devices Listing Section (Conformity Assessment Branch) as an exempt product under the Therapeutic Goods Act.\n\nReviews:\n\nTestimonial from USA customer:\nIf all I have to do is commit to less than 30 minutes every 3-4 days to listen to soothing music in order to not be sick -- well, who wouldn't do that?  \nThe program definitely works, and I have told many of my friends about it so they won't have to suffer as I was before I found Nevasic.   You were right in your initial email that it would take a few days to really work.  Although I did have some relief the very first time I listened to it, it took a couple of days for the impact to really \"stick.\"  By the 4th day, though, I was able to not only eat to nourish the new life inside me, but I was able to get down on the floor to play w/ my 3 year old -- which I hadn't been able to do for several weeks.  For that alone, I thank you!!   (As would he, if he knew your program was the reason he was finally able to play with mommy again.)  :o) \nI can't believe there isn't more information out there about the program.  I only happened upon it while on google because I was desperate to find something - anything - that would at least alleviate my nausea, if not cure it.  I'm glad I found it!!  You guys should definitely advertise w/ OBGYNs in the States; there are a lot of women who need your program who don't even know that it's available.  I will be mentioning it to my OB at my next appointment.  \nNevasic is amazing - I wish I had known about it during my last pregnancy, because it certainly would have been a lot more enjoyable for me!   Thanks so much for an amazing product!  I will also be submitting a glowing review on iTunes, which is where I purchased the program.  \nThanks again! \nTara"

A calibration procedure was also implemented to accurately measure the angle with the horizontal plane as in the sacral slope. \nThrough though the developpement, Regis has shown an extraordinary sense of patience and astounding programming skills so as to accurately provide a tool that fits the needs of the surgeon and the spine care provider to best treat the patients ; and I thank him for his efforts. \n\nI am very proud of releasing this small software in the community, and I hope it will facilitate a little bit the life of my dear colleagues and the patients. \n\nI thank the colleagues who gave me their kind advice on the software during its developpement and wish they will find it useful.\"\n \nDr Frederic Jacquot\nChirurgien du Rachis\nChirurgien Orthopédiste,\nChirurgien des Hôpitaux de Paris"

These damaging effects can be alleviated by staying in the shade, wearing light clothing, or by using sunscreen.\n\nUVScan visualizes the damaged part of the skin as darker areas. Smaller wrinkles in the facial area, which are indicative of prematurly aged skin due to uv exposure, are easy to spot in the same way. The analysis works best about 24 to 48 hours after intensive exposure.\n\nThe analysis relies on images taken under good lighting conditions, without extreme dark or bright spots. For best results with an iPhone 4, use images taken with a distance of roughly 4 inches (10 centimeters). Shots of the cheek and nose should be taken from the side, while shots of the forehead should be taken directly facing the area to analyze. The integrated flash light of the iPhone 4 will further enhance the quality of the analysis.\n\nUVScan resulted in a 2004 scientific paper:\nBlum-A, Vollert-B, Schlagenhauff-B (2004)\nVisualization Method Based on Digital Image Analysis Reveals Photodamage of the Skin\nArch Dermatol 2004;140 1173-1174"

In both cases, a loop suture would have been  less effective and a waste of time.\n\nThe list of suturing techniques dealt with in this application, which currently stands at 9, will be gradually increased with free updates.

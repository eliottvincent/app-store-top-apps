Featured in Apple's \"Amazing Apps\" TV commercial.\n## Staying focused with the cutest gamified timer. \n## Over 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by our users.  \n\n\"Forest works well, and if your goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you.\"— The New York Times \n\n\"In order to establish new, better habits, it's helpful to engage with tools that make it easier to reinforce them. For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

You can add notes, tag it, schedule it, and break it down into smaller steps.\n\n• Your Projects\nCreate a Project for any big goal, then add the to-dos to reach it. Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)\n\n\nMORE THINGS TO LOVE\n\nAs you dive deeper, you’ll find Things packed with helpful features.

Every detail is thoughtfully considered, then polished to perfection.\n\n“It’s like the unicorn of productivity tools: deep enough for serious work, surprisingly easy to use, and gorgeous enough to enjoy staring at.”\n—Apple\n\n\nGET THINGS TODAY\n\nWhatever it is you want to accomplish in life, Things can help you get there.

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

Touch the screen to show the pointer - which is controlled either by dragging your finger around the screen (easy) or by orientation (takes a little practice) - your choice.\n\nRequirements: Computer running Mac OS X 10.7 or higher, WiFi connection (on the same local network or by creating a computer-to-computer network), and PowerPoint or Keynote (choose the program on the back side of the App). Please note that this app cannot control an iPad Keynote presentation.\n\nA small Mac application, PointerServer, must be downloaded to your computer and started whenever Pointer is used. This program is available for free at:\nhttp://www.zentropysoftware.com/ZS/Pointer_files/PointerServer3.zip\n\nPlease note that the presentation runs on your computer, not directly from the iPhone or iPad. Instead the iPhone/iPad controls the computer.\n\nA support e-mail address is listed at the support web site."

      "label": "ransfer files the easy way, just drag & drop the file and we will handle the rest. Like Apple AirDrop, but works and on all major platforms and computers that don't support AirDrop.\n\nWith millions of downloads in the App Store, thousands of happy users and millions of photo and file transfers, this app is a necessary tool for your iOS device.\n\n\nSIMPLE FILE SHARING\nYou don't need to be tech-savvy to share files, photos or videos.\n\nAIRDROP SUPPORT FOR OLDER DEVICES\nIt adds Airdrop-like transfer capability to older devices without official support for Airdrop, like your older Mac or iOS devices with iOS 6.\n\nSIMPLE TO USE\nNo need to pair devices or set up a transfer to send files or photos. Designed for quick and easy sharing of files, photos, and videos from your other device, photos and videos are automatically saved to the 'Camera roll' album.\n\nNO REGISTRATION\nJust open the app and start sharing files, holiday photos, or family videos – no need to enter emails or passwords.\n\nNO FILE TYPE LIMITS\nYou can transfer any file type, no restrictions. MP3s, images, PDFs, presentations, and way more.\n\nPHOTOS AND VIDEOS\nInstashare preserves photo metadata in all transfer directions (EXIF information, location, etc). Transfer in full resolution.\n\nWORKS WITHOUT INTERNET\nYou don't need to be connected to the internet, just use a local wi-fi or Bluetooth (iOS and OS X only) to transfer files.\n\nBUILT-IN EXTENSION\nYou can use Instashare with various apps thanks to the system built-in extension – share pictures from Photo library, links from Safari, and other files straight from 3rd party apps.\n\nCLIPBOARD TRANSFER\nStop retyping long URLs and so on. Just copy and transfer it in a few seconds.\nDrag a clipboard item & drop it on the device – it will be automatically copied to clipboard on the device.\n\nSECURE\nFiles and photos are sent only between your devices, without making a copy somewhere in the Cloud. They never leave your local wi-fi network, keeping your files and photos safe.\n\nIOS DEVICE WAKEUP\nNo need to manually open the mobile app to transfer a file or clipboard to device – just wait a few seconds for the device to appear.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nTo transfer files and photos between two devices, both of them need to have this app installed. Mobile apps are free, desktop apps are paid. \nAccess to a properly configured wi-fi network (or bluetooth between iOS and OS X) is required for this app to work. Some public or private wi-fi networks may be configured to block communication between devices, preventing the transfer connection to be established.\nYou don't need to use the latest device or OS available, works with older systems as well, from iOS 6, iPad 2 or iPhone 4.\n\nVideos on how the app works at instahsareapp.com and app support at support.twomanshow.co"

      "label": "Jotter is the most appropriate tool to write a note on an iPhone or an iPad.\n\nJotter is like a notebook. You can easily write something quickly or draw a simple diagram with Jotter conveniently. Instead of a notebook, you can use Jotter to write or draw your idea in a quick, easy and convenient way. Jotter is acting like a real notebook. The size of you device is the size of your notebook, which will rotate automatically as you rotate the device, so what you see is what you get. If you want to use it in portrait mode, you can lay the device lengthwise. If you want to use it in landscape mode, you can lay your device widthwise.\n\nJotter provides three note lists: ‘My Notes’ list to manage note prepared on the device; ‘Favorites’ list showing notes designated as favorites; and iCloud list showing notes on iCloud. You can edit notes on ‘My Notes’ list and upload them to iCloud, if you have an iCloud account. You can change the type of a list by swiping the list view left or right.\n\nYou can use Jotter on all iOS devices (iPhone and iPad). If you have several devices, you can share your notes on all devices via iCloud.\n\n\nHandwriting\n• Provide a variable-width pen optimized for handwriting: if you write fast, the pen width becomes thinner, and vice versa. You can also use a fixed-width pen.\n• Provide a highlighter with which you can draw a translucent line over text.\n• Provide a zoom-in window, with which you can enter much more content on a limited space. It will also support you to write text more comfortably.\n• When writing on the zoom-in window, the window will move automatically to write without additional control. When you reach the right margin of the page, it will automatically move to the next line.\n• The zoom-in window supports both text directions: right-to-left and left-to-right.\n\niCloud\n• As notes made on several devices are stored in an iCloud stream, you can see all the notes on each device.\n• You can download a note to your device among notes stored in the iCloud stream. You can edit the downloaded note, and share it with other devices via iCloud.\n• For notes with different sizes (made on other devices), you can change the size and position of the notes when opening them.\n\nShare\n• You can send a note to other people via email as a JPEG or PNG file.\n• You can upload a note on SMS by using Copy function. Copy your content and paste it on a SMS window, then it will be sent to SMS.\n• You can store notes in My Photo list.\n• You can send your notes to your Twitter account set on your device.\n• You can send your notes to your Facebook account set on your device, or upload them by logging in Facebook.\n• You can send a note to other apps as a PDF file by using ‘Open with other app’ function.\n• Jotter will send an image as you can see on the screen. If you want to share a portrait image, lay the device widthwise and share the image. If you want to share a landscape image, lay the device lengthwise and share the image."

      "label": "\"...a true notepad experience that may help you make a clean break from the pencil-and-paper era.\"  -New York Times. \n\nUsers describe Mental Note as \"the only notepad app... that's actually better than, and as simple as, a pen and paper.\" It's \"the future of note taking\", and \"a big sketchpad... [to] free associate and put stuff down in any format\".\n\nTurn your iPhone or iPod touch into a digital notepad.  Combine photographs, voice recordings, drawings and text - all on the same page, in any order you choose.\n\nAn idea... a flash - a moment of genius.  When a thought hits, and you have to remember it, why limit how you record it?  The more context and sensory details you can capture, the clearer the idea can be put down.  Use photographs, audio, sketching and text together on the same page... a digital page that can be shared with anyone.  \n\nMental Note allows you to capture ideas as they happen: use photographs, dictate, add text, sketch on anything.  Ideas clarified.  Creativity captured.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Draw with your finger using multiple colours and widths on top of photographs, text, or anywhere else on the page.  Zoom in to sketch fine details.\n\n- Take a photo or choose one from your album and add it to the page. \n\n- Add audio to the page by recording with the built-in microphone (iPhone) or an external microphone (iPod touch). Continue to edit your note while recording. \n\n- Organize your notes using tags. \n\n- Password protect your private notes and flag your important ones. \n\n- Attach Calendar events to your notes.\n\n- Undo, redo anything in the note by shaking the device.\n\n- Delete note sections using the toolbar button or by swiping any note section. \n\n- Move a note section by swiping and then dragging it to its new location.\n\n- Length of a note is limited only by device memory. \n\n- Export in a variety of formats including PDF, text, Mental Note format, and more.  Send using email, iCloud, Dropbox, and more.  \n\n* Send a note in Mental Note format so the note may be imported into another person's Mental Note app.\n\n* Using email, export a complete note directly from Mental Note as either a PDF document or a picture (each audio recording is attached to the email as a separate file; use QuickTime or another modern media player to play the attached audio).  You can also email just the text from your note.\n\n- Export your notes and backups to your iCloud and/or Dropbox account.\n\n- Share a note with your friends using Twitter. \n\n- Map the location a note was created at (if location services are enabled). \n\n- Change the size and font of the text in your notes. \n\n- Change the color and background of your notes. \n\n- Numerous other configuration options. \n\n- Supports all orientations.\n\n\nTHIS VERSION IS OPTIMIZED FOR iPhone & iPod touch.  FOR iPad, PLEASE SEE Mental Note for iPad.\n\n\nRead more: www.zymbiotic.com\nTwitter: @zymbiotic\nFacebook: facebook.com/zymbiotic"

      "label": "PDFOptim is a simple and intuitive way to compress, optimize and reduce PDF documents on iPhones and iPads. PDFOptim provides easy and effective ways to compress large image and graphics heavy PDF files. Inbuilt side-by-side preview to compare original and optimized PDF.\n\n* * * PDFOptim for Mac is also available on the Mac App Store. * * *\n\nCompressed PDF documents requires less disk space for storage and faster uploads and downloads saves transmission time and cost. The PDFOptim gives you access to compression options to help you to reduce PDF file size without compromising the document's integrity. PDFOptim rewrites the entire PDF documents using selected compression options as efficiently as possible. Some PDF documents might not get compressed, because the PDF documents might be already compressed or have nothing much to compress.\n\nIf your PDF documents are in another app (For Example Mail, DropBox or SkyDrive etc.) that uses the Open In… button, tap the button to open the PDF document in PDFOptim. You can also transfer PDF documents from your desktop computer via iTunes into PDFOptim application on your iPhone or iPad.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n- PDF optimization options to set from Image Color Model, Image Resolution, JPEG Image Quality and Optimise graphics level.\n\n- Image color model to choose from RGB, Gray and Mono. Selecting Monochrome color model compression option converts raster PDF contents into black and white which helps reduces PDF file size to greater extent. It is very helpful when compressing scanned books mainly containing text. Optimizing PDF using Monochrome color model can create 24 times smaller PDF compared to RGB color model compression.\n\n- Image resolution ppi (pixels/inch) control to resize raster image contents. Downsampling at lower resolution decrease the file size dramatically.\n\n- Quality control. Set quality from lossless to least for resampling all raster images into PDF. It allows you to control optimized PDF size and viewing quality.\n\n- Optimize graphics option removes superfluous information to reduce vector graphics heavy PDF. Increase in optimize graphics from 'Level 1' to 'Level 5' reduces output PDF file size less to more respectively. Higher optimise graphics level reduces file size but also reduces PDF visual fidelity at higher zoom scale. Choose appropriate Optimize graphics level to balance file size and visual fidelity. Choose Optimize graphics option 'None' to avoid vector graphics optimization.\n\nThis option is very useful when PDF content mainly consist of high precision vector graphics. This option removes such superfluous information, thereby reducing the size of your PDF files. Usually PDF drawing, note-taking and PDF markup apps creates large vector graphics heavy PDF files which can be compressed by this option efficiently.\n\n\n- Password protected PDF documents supported for optimization using correct password.\n\n- Single or multiple optimized PDFs can be shared as single ZIP (*.zip) file.\n\n- Allows Optimized PDFs to Open In… another application, Mail, Message, Print, share PDFs to nearby iOS devices via AirDrop.\n\n- Use Copy to iTunes to save and share optimized PDFs on your desktop computer.\n\n- Real time side-by-side preview of original and optimized PDF. It helps you to compare optimized PDF integrity and quality side-by-side. Synchronized scrolling and zooming controls for both preview showing file size and reduced percentage information.\n\n\nPDF VIEWER:\n\n- Inbuilt PDF viewer with fully selectable and searchable text contents. Select and copy text to clipboard for further use.\n\n- Pinch out and Pinch in to ZoomIn and ZoomOut view.\n\n- Built in search feature to find a character, word or sentence any where in the PDF document.\n\n- Scroll through your document by thumbnail view or Go to page feature.\n\nNote: PDFOptim is standalone application running natively to optimize PDF documents securely on your iOS device.\n\nYou can refer User Manual for any assistance Or Contact Support."

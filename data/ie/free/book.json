Kindle Vella and In-App purchase of Tokens are currently only available in the US. \n\nGO BEYOND PAPER\nTurn your iPhone or iPad into a book with the free Kindle app—so you can read anytime, anywhere. Explore these reading features in the Kindle app:\n\n• Read your way. Customize your text size, font type, margins, text alignment, and orientation (portrait or landscape)—and choose whether to turn pages from left to right or continuously scroll. Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests.

I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter. \n\n\nمن صناع Quran.com يأتي تطبيق القرآن للأجهزة المحمولة، تطبيق للمصحف ذو صفحات جميلة خالي تماما من الاعلانات.\n\nلقد أصبح من السهل قراءة القرآن بالشارع، وحفظه، والاستماع إلى قارئك المفضل.\n\nهذا هو مجرد بداية لتطبيق القرآن. سنعمل على تحديث التطبيق بشكل منتظم إن شاء الله، ونحب أن نسمع رأيك ومتطلبتك. يمكنك الوصول إلينا عن طريق البريد الإلكتروني ios@quran.com\n\nعَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة."

Це чудова альтернатива звичайній електронній книзі, оскільки єдиний девайс (смартфон або планшет) поєднує в собі функцію читалки та інші корисні опції: дзвінки, камера, галерея, ігри та додатки тощо.\n\nВаша улюблена бібліотека тепер під рукою\n\nВаша особиста бібліотека буде завжди під рукою. Щоб вибрати, що почитати, досить відкрити додаток, знайти автора або назву книжки. Все це можна зробити, не виходячи з дому.

Також у додатку представлена дитяча електронна література, у тому числі аудіоказки, які малюк слухатиме із задоволенням. Серед різноманіття видань  будь-який користувач зможе знайти варіант до смаку.\n\nДо кожної книги додається опис з відомостями про видавництво, кількість сторінок, мову видання: українську або російську. Якщо ви плануєте придбати видання зараз або пізніше - додайте його у перелік побажань, який поділяється на дві категорії: книги та аудіокнижки. У розділі «Придбані книги» збирайте свою особисту колекцію для читання, яку ви купили на сайті Yakaboo.ua, або отримали безкоштовно.\n\nРанній доступ до топ-новинок, завдяки співпраці Yakaboo з багатьма видавництвами, дає можливість читати найновіші книги іноземних авторів, які ще недавно були доступні лише англійською мовою.\n\nЗавдяки трекеру-закладці не потрібно запам'ятовувати, на якій сторінці ви закінчили читати. Видання запускається там, де ви минулий раз зупинилися. У блокноті можна залишати коментарі та цитати навіть у процесі читання.\n\nЗавантажуйте додаток Yakaboo та отримайте доступ до величезного й неосяжного світу електронних та аудіокнижок.\n\n\nОтримайте доступ до найкращих книг онлайн таких авторів як:\n\nДжоан Роулінг, Олександр Авраменко, Всеволод Нестайко, Колін Тіппінг, Вахтанг Кіпіані, Ювал Ной Харарі, Євген Комаровський, Роальд Дал, Луїза Мей Олкотт, Юлія Ярмоленко, Джордж Орвелл, Лоран Гунель, Елізабет Гілберт, Фредрік Бакман, Айн Ренд, Людмила Петрановська, Меган МакДоналд, Рей Бредбері, Антуан де Сент-Екзюпері, Джефф Кінні, Джейн Остін, Стівен Кові, Тара Шустер, Нассім Ніколас Талеб, Бодо Шефер, Михайло Лабковський, Донато Каррізі, Стівен Кінг, Зиґмунд Фройд, Джон Грей, Роберт Ґалбрейт, Ю Несбьо, Марк Менсон, Грегорі Девід Робертс, Джоджо Мойес, Елінор Портер, Луїза Л.

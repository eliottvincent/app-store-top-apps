Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip.

When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

With the world's most comprehensive book repository you’ll always find the book you are looking for.\n \nThe app is designed from a minimalistic perspective which makes the app extremely simple to use and gives you incredible user experience.\n \nTo add books to your reading list you simply:\n     - Scan the barcode of the physical book to get directly to the book page and then you simply add it.\n     - You can search for a specific book, author, genre and even author and then browse until you find the book you are looking for.\n     - By adding books manually your Minimalistic Reading List can contain every book in the world. \n \nYour reading list will be divided into three categories - Reading, To Read & Finished\n \nIf you are like me and love different genres, you can create personalized groups based on genres or in any other way you want. It’s extremely simple to create groups you simply:\n     - Set the name you wish the group has.\n     - Add all the books you want and then save the group, that’s it.\n \nIn the explore section of the app you’ll get an understanding of what the other users are reading, reading tips through the book of the week, you can browse by category. The Popular section shows the top books that the community is reading right at this moment.\n \nI created Minimalistic Reading List because I still believe that it’s important to read and I wanted to make it easier and more fun by bringing like-minded people together. For us who read a lot, it will eventually become a bit expensive to purchase every book so I have included some links to the magnificent invention - The Kindle.\n \nThrough the partnership with The Book Depository you can purchase books from your reading list at a very competitive price. They also offer all of us free and fast worldwide shipping! To purchase a book you simply press the “Purchase Book” button and you’ll be redirected to the correct book page on bookdepository.com.\n \nI’ll keep updating the app to make it even better and here are some features that will be available soon:\n     - Filtering book searches by language\n     - Progressbar on for the books you’re reading\n \nTerms & Conditions - https://bit.ly/2N5Aat6\nPrivicy Policy - https://bit.ly/2oVXLo7"

      "label": "Biblia Română (Romanian Holy Bible)\nCornilescu (1921)\nDumitru Cornilescu (n. 4 aprilie 1891, comuna Slașoma, județul Mehedinți - d. 1975, Elveția) a fost ierodiacon și autor al unei traduceri în limba română a Bibliei, publicată în 1921, traducere care este în prezent cea mai răspândită traducere în rândul confesiunilor protestante (inclusiv cele neoprotestante).\nBiblia (din lb. greacă βιβλίον, pl. βιβλία -cărți) se referă la scripturile sacre din iudaism și creștinism. Aceste scripturi sunt compilații ale unor documente separate (numite „cărți”) scrise într-un interval de timp de circa 1000 de ani. Numai Vechiul Testament are circa 100-150 scriitori diferiți, provenind din intelectualitatea aflată în serviciul conducătorilor politici. Cărțile sale au fost publicate separat și adunate în secolele I-II e.n. pentru a forma prima Biblie ebraică, Tanach, iar mai târziu, cu adăugiri, Biblia creștină, numită de creștini și Sfânta Scriptură.\nPrima parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Vechiul Testament (din grecescul \"palaia diathékè\"). Vechiul Testament reprezintă în mare traducerea grecească (sau din aceasta în alte limbi) a textului sacru ebraic așa cum era el prin secol II î.e.n. O împărțire cu origine evreiască pe criterii funcționale a Vechiului Testament îl împarte pe acesta în Legea (\"Legea lui Moise\", \"Pentateucul\", adică primele \"cinci cărți\" ale Bibliei), Profeții și Scrierile Sfinte. A doua parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Noul Testament.\nPrima traducere integrală a Bibliei în limba română a fost tipărită în 1688. Biblia a cunoscut mai multe traduceri în limba română. Denominațiile neoprotestante folosesc traducerea Bibliei în limba română de Dumitru Cornilescu, cu sau fără explicații. De remarcat că traducerea Cornilescu a fost inițial acceptată de Biserica Ortodoxă, prima traducere a lui Dumitru Cornilescu a apărut cu binecuvântarea patriarhului României, fiind ulterior respinsă de Biserica Ortodoxă (după ce preotul Dumitru Cornilescu a început să dea învățături specifice cultelor evanghelice cum ar fi îndreptățirea prin credință), dar folosită de Oastea Domnului și de confesiunile neoprotestante. Criticii din vremea publicării ei au considerat-o „net superioară oricărei alte traduceri, fiind prezentată într-o limbă suplă și curgătoare, care lipsește oricărei alte traduceri; fiind expusă într-o limbă care vorbește înseși inimilor oamenilor”. Biserica Ortodoxă Română a generat, la rândul ei, mai multe traduceri de-a lungul timpului, fie integrale fie parțiale, a Sfintei Scripturi, e.g., Biblia „Carol al II-lea”, Palia de la Orăștie, „Biblia pe versuri tocmită”."

The text of one or a few hadith alone are not taken as rulings by themselves; scholars have a sophisticated process using the principles of fiqh to come up with rulings.

The game encourages children of all ages to read for pleasure and is perfect to play at home or school, alongside Teach Your Monster to Read or on its own.\n\nThere are hours of reading fun, from following signposts and reading aloud with Goldspear the librarian, to discovering books which help you bake delicious cakes and find treasure. It’s up to you to choose what to explore and when, but hurry, the villagers need your help. Your monster must use all its wisdom, skill and bravery to stop the book-eating goblin from causing chaos in the village and eating all the books!\n\nWHY READING FOR FUN?\n•        Boost your child’s reading confidence \n•        Develop your child’s empathy, as they put themselves in different characters’ shoes and develop an understanding of the wider world\n•        Improve your child’s skills in reading for different purposes, from recipes, to signposts and instructions\n•        Read books with friends.  Choose brand new books, or re-read old favorites  \n•        Create positive screen time for children in a fun environment \n•        Collect over 70 brilliant free ebooks from Usborne, Okido, Otter-Barry and more.\n\nReading for pleasure is a proven method to transform literacy skills and academic performance in children.  The pedagogy of reading for pleasure within this game has been developed in close collaboration with educational experts from the UK’s Roehampton University.\n\nBE PART OF A READING COMMUNITY \n•        Make friends and help out the villagers with quests that require reading\n•        Pop into the village library to read along with Goldspear, Coco and more\n•        Read different kinds of texts, from signposts and instructions to entire fiction and non-fiction books\n•        Complete jobs to get rewarded with books for your monster’s bookshelf\n•        Solve challenges and follow the story as it unfolds, read recipes to make treats, or go on quests to overcome the book-eating goblin.\n•        Discover new authors, poems, stories and a series of children’s books that you’ll love. \n\nCreated by Teach Your Monster, Reading for Fun is part of The Usborne Foundation, a charity founded by children’s publisher, Peter Usborne MBE.

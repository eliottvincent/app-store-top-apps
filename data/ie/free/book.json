Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress.

Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip.

Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

Aceste scripturi sunt compilații ale unor documente separate (numite „cărți”) scrise într-un interval de timp de circa 1000 de ani. Numai Vechiul Testament are circa 100-150 scriitori diferiți, provenind din intelectualitatea aflată în serviciul conducătorilor politici. Cărțile sale au fost publicate separat și adunate în secolele I-II e.n. pentru a forma prima Biblie ebraică, Tanach, iar mai târziu, cu adăugiri, Biblia creștină, numită de creștini și Sfânta Scriptură.\nPrima parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Vechiul Testament (din grecescul \"palaia diathékè\"). Vechiul Testament reprezintă în mare traducerea grecească (sau din aceasta în alte limbi) a textului sacru ebraic așa cum era el prin secol II î.e.n. O împărțire cu origine evreiască pe criterii funcționale a Vechiului Testament îl împarte pe acesta în Legea (\"Legea lui Moise\", \"Pentateucul\", adică primele \"cinci cărți\" ale Bibliei), Profeții și Scrierile Sfinte. A doua parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Noul Testament.\nPrima traducere integrală a Bibliei în limba română a fost tipărită în 1688. Biblia a cunoscut mai multe traduceri în limba română. Denominațiile neoprotestante folosesc traducerea Bibliei în limba română de Dumitru Cornilescu, cu sau fără explicații. De remarcat că traducerea Cornilescu a fost inițial acceptată de Biserica Ortodoxă, prima traducere a lui Dumitru Cornilescu a apărut cu binecuvântarea patriarhului României, fiind ulterior respinsă de Biserica Ortodoxă (după ce preotul Dumitru Cornilescu a început să dea învățături specifice cultelor evanghelice cum ar fi îndreptățirea prin credință), dar folosită de Oastea Domnului și de confesiunile neoprotestante. Criticii din vremea publicării ei au considerat-o „net superioară oricărei alte traduceri, fiind prezentată într-o limbă suplă și curgătoare, care lipsește oricărei alte traduceri; fiind expusă într-o limbă care vorbește înseși inimilor oamenilor”. Biserica Ortodoxă Română a generat, la rândul ei, mai multe traduceri de-a lungul timpului, fie integrale fie parțiale, a Sfintei Scripturi, e.g., Biblia „Carol al II-lea”, Palia de la Orăștie, „Biblia pe versuri tocmită”."

      "label": "Book Track is an iPhone, iPad, and Mac app that can track your books — both the ones you own and the ones you hope to own in the future.\n\nAvid readers know how difficult it can be to keep tabs on a growing book collection and that's where Book Track comes into its own by making it quicker and easier than ever to track your reading. Not only can you track all of the books that you own, as well as how far you've read, but you can also keep a wishlist of the books that you'd like to pick up in the future. Whether a book is in your 'Library' or your 'Wishlist,' Book Track displays information and gorgeous cover art for all of them. While Book Track uses information from the internet, more obscure books can also be added manually, too.\n\nBook Track is a free app and is limited to 5 books. A single in-app purchase unlocks support for unlimited books across iPhone and iPad. A separate purchase is required to unlock the full Mac app.\n\nBook Track users can look forward to:\n\n- A synchronized list of books and information — whether you save a book on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, it'll be synced across all devices. Both your Library and Wishlist will be synced seamlessly and automatically so you'll never lose a book again — or buy the same book twice because you forgot you already own it!\n\n- Easy and comprehensive book organization — Every book you add to your Library can be marked as read, reading, or unread, with each book also supporting tags to help you find similar books throughout your collection. Book information like title, author, description, publisher, year of publication, genre, and even the description can also be edited to make your Library as accurate or personal as possible.\n\n- Quote saving — Find a passage within a book that you want to save for later? Book Track can save your favorite quotes in one place so you can read them again later. You can even put them on your Home screen using a widget.\n\n- All the stats, right where you'll see them — Book Track collects library and reading statistics and puts them right on your Home screen with gorgeous widgets. iPad users can enjoy an extra large widget with even more stats, too!\n\n- Support for importing books from services like Goodreads, BookBuddy, Reading List, and more — It's never been easier to import your books from other apps and services so you don't have to start building your library all over again. Book collections can also be exported to PDF and CSV as well.\n\n- Deep integration with iOS and macOS — Book Track includes support for the latest Apple features including Shortcuts and Siri, while Widgets can be used to put your favorite quotes right onto your Home screen.\n\n- Privacy — Book Track doesn't collect any of your personal data and doesn't track you in any way. Books should be fun, not another reason to worry about your data privacy."

How long did it take to read them? Leio can help you answer these questions and many more.\n\nFun fact:\nLeio means “I read” in Portuguese.\n\n---\n\nLeio is a digital journal to help you track and manage your reading. It's designed primarily around physical books, but you can also use electronic readers or other devices. Leio helps you organize your library, your notes and your favorite quotes, but that's just the beginning. Timing your reading sessions makes it easier to set aside some time and turn reading into a habit. The data gathered this way quickly turn into an extensive record of your reading life, providing you with statistics and information about your habits. These data can also be projected into the future: Leio will tell you when you will finish each book and help you plan accordingly.\n\nTIMER\nTime your reading sessions and gain insight into your habits. Life can be distracting: use Leio to set aside some time and focus on your reading.\n\nPROGRESS\nKeep track of where you are in multiple books. A quick look will tell you what page to read next, what percentage of the book you have completed, how long you have read it for and much more.\nNew: add new books easily with Leio's barcode scanner!\n\nPREDICTIONS\nLeio will learn from your habits and give you accurate predictions to help you manage your reading life. Know exactly when you will finish a book and for how long you have to read until you are done.\n\nDEADLINES\nIf you need to finish a book by a certain date, Leio can tell you how long or how many pages to read per day to finish in time. You can also play with the settings and come up with your own reading plan: tell Leio how much and how often you plan to read and see when you might finish in real time.\n\nPLANNER\nTell Leio how often you want to read each book and use the planner section to stay on track. See how much you have read on each day, how much you still have to read, and how much time to set aside to accomplish your goals!\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\nNew: Complete achievements to unlock exclusive iMessage stickers!\n\nNOTES AND QUOTES\nEasily save and search your reading notes and always have them at hand. Share them with your friends or social networks.\nNew: use Leio's text recognition service to save and share your favorite quotes even more easily!*\n\nSTATISTICS\nCheck how your reading life evolves over time. Charts and data for different timespans will help you stay motivated to read more and more.\n\nARCHIVE\nLeio will keep an extensive record of your reading sessions, so you will always be able to tell when you started a book, when you finished it, how long it took you to read it, over how many days, how many sessions and much more. Keep track of how much you have read and challenge yourself to read more. Your finished books can be searched or filtered by tags and ratings, so your information is always easy to find!\nNew: export your data to have even more control over your information.\n\nSHARE\nShare your progress with friends or save reports for yourself. Now you can also sync your progress to Goodreads and post status updates!\n\n---\n\n* Choose between a monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscription.

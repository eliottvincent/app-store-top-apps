Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip.

Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "Biblia Română (Romanian Holy Bible)\nCornilescu (1921)\nDumitru Cornilescu (n. 4 aprilie 1891, comuna Slașoma, județul Mehedinți - d. 1975, Elveția) a fost ierodiacon și autor al unei traduceri în limba română a Bibliei, publicată în 1921, traducere care este în prezent cea mai răspândită traducere în rândul confesiunilor protestante (inclusiv cele neoprotestante).\nBiblia (din lb. greacă βιβλίον, pl. βιβλία -cărți) se referă la scripturile sacre din iudaism și creștinism. Aceste scripturi sunt compilații ale unor documente separate (numite „cărți”) scrise într-un interval de timp de circa 1000 de ani. Numai Vechiul Testament are circa 100-150 scriitori diferiți, provenind din intelectualitatea aflată în serviciul conducătorilor politici. Cărțile sale au fost publicate separat și adunate în secolele I-II e.n. pentru a forma prima Biblie ebraică, Tanach, iar mai târziu, cu adăugiri, Biblia creștină, numită de creștini și Sfânta Scriptură.\nPrima parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Vechiul Testament (din grecescul \"palaia diathékè\"). Vechiul Testament reprezintă în mare traducerea grecească (sau din aceasta în alte limbi) a textului sacru ebraic așa cum era el prin secol II î.e.n. O împărțire cu origine evreiască pe criterii funcționale a Vechiului Testament îl împarte pe acesta în Legea (\"Legea lui Moise\", \"Pentateucul\", adică primele \"cinci cărți\" ale Bibliei), Profeții și Scrierile Sfinte. A doua parte a Bibliei creștine este numită Noul Testament.\nPrima traducere integrală a Bibliei în limba română a fost tipărită în 1688. Biblia a cunoscut mai multe traduceri în limba română. Denominațiile neoprotestante folosesc traducerea Bibliei în limba română de Dumitru Cornilescu, cu sau fără explicații. De remarcat că traducerea Cornilescu a fost inițial acceptată de Biserica Ortodoxă, prima traducere a lui Dumitru Cornilescu a apărut cu binecuvântarea patriarhului României, fiind ulterior respinsă de Biserica Ortodoxă (după ce preotul Dumitru Cornilescu a început să dea învățături specifice cultelor evanghelice cum ar fi îndreptățirea prin credință), dar folosită de Oastea Domnului și de confesiunile neoprotestante. Criticii din vremea publicării ei au considerat-o „net superioară oricărei alte traduceri, fiind prezentată într-o limbă suplă și curgătoare, care lipsește oricărei alte traduceri; fiind expusă într-o limbă care vorbește înseși inimilor oamenilor”. Biserica Ortodoxă Română a generat, la rândul ei, mai multe traduceri de-a lungul timpului, fie integrale fie parțiale, a Sfintei Scripturi, e.g., Biblia „Carol al II-lea”, Palia de la Orăștie, „Biblia pe versuri tocmită”."

Read the horrifying story of Ray, haunted by messages from the grave, as his father reaches out to him from the depths of Hell. Fear for your own life as you follow the gruesome text instructions that David followed, they lead to a shallow grave for one poor soul. Tag along with Joe as his love for street art and graffiti leads to death and destruction. Read Hal’s harrowing texts – has his phone been hacked or has his past finally caught up with him?\n\nyOwl reaches out from the other side and pulls you in, dragging you kicking and screaming into the bowels of Hell to feed you to the Beast. These stories are not for the feint-hearted, they’re not bedtime reading and they shouldn’t be read alone. yOwl will take you into the lives of the scarred and tortured, part the curtains on their windows and reveal to you their inner secrets – each and every one of them has a story to tell and every story has a very, very unhappy ending.\n\nFor fans of horror and fantastic fiction, yOwl feeds you addictive stories told through a series of text messages between the characters involved. Read on as friends’ happy, emoji filled messages turn sour, the blood splashes over their screens, their fingers dig into the touch screen keyboards as their knuckles turn white with fear. \n\nyOwl aims to keep you awake at nights with its phantasmagorial tales, filled with monsters from other dimensions, evil dead roadkill, insane killers, spurned lovers, violent psychopaths and things that even we can’t explain.\n\nUpdated weekly with more and more freaky tales and blood-curdling chronicles written by blood-loving, crazed writers who we only let out of their cages when they’ve scared the pants off the boss, it’s our mission to frighten you so bad you’ll never be able to sleep with the light off again!\n\nIn texts, no one can hear you scream.\n\nYou can unlock all yOwl chat stories, via auto-renewable subscription: \nwe offer three auto-renewing subscription options: weekly subscription, monthly subscription, annual subscription.\nBy subscribing you get unlimited access to all original scary chat stories, images and videos.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew at the end of each term and your credit card will be charged through your iTunes account.\nYou can turn off auto-renew at any time from your account settings but refunds will not be provided for any unused portion of the term.\nYour account will be charged according to your plan for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\nIf you wish to avoid auto-renewal you must turn it off at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period in your Account Settings.\nPrivacy policy and Terms of Use Page:\nhttps://yowl.stefrasoft.com\nhttps://yowl.stefrasoft.com/terms/privacy-policy"

It also links to braille displays for braille readers.\n\nEasyReader is fully optimized for use with iOS VoiceOver and iOS supported Braille displays.\n\nEasyReader Features:\n\nOpen a World of Accessible Books\nEasyReader provides global access to millions of books from accessible book libraries around the world.

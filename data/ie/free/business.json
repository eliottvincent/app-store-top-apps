During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

The current driver and vehicle information can be displayed to help ensure user’s safety. If information is incorrect, it’s possible to submit a report.

Some functionality might be unavailable in certain countries. If you have questions about how this app is being used within your organization, your company’s IT administrator should have those answers for you.

      "label": "Blip is a free app for BrightHR customers. It lets you easily track your employees’ work hours and locations on the go. Here’s how it works: \n\nGeolocation \nUse the app to create a geofence—a virtual boundary—around your workplace. Then, when your employees enter or leave the geofence, Blip picks up their location and asks them to clock in or out, helping you to know exactly where your staff have worked and how long for. \n\nQR codes \nAlternatively, you can use Blip’s smart scanning system to record your employees’ work hours instead. \nYour staff use Blip to scan a QR code—a type of barcode—when they arrive and leave work. Then, each time they scan the code, Blip will register them as clocked in or out. It’s that simple. \n\nBreaks\nBlip makes it easy to track breaks, too. At the tap of a button, your staff can log the start and end of their breaks, so you can see how long and how often they take downtime.  \n\nHow Blip helps you:\n    -    Check your employees’ work hours and track their location in an instant. \n    -    Keep an eye on your employees’ breaks and make sure they’re getting enough downtime. \n    -    Change an incorrect shift or break time in a few quick taps.\n    -    Create multiple locations and easily track where your employees have worked.\n    -    View a full history of an employee’s work hours and filter the date range easily.\n    -    Export the work history for an individual or team and save it as a spreadsheet for your records."

Staff can set their own availability, swap shifts, and request time off, so no more information is lost in translation. On the other hand, managers can approve or decline requests on the go, directly in the App.\n\nROUND-THE-CLOCK TIME TRACKING\nEasily clock in and out of work with your phone. Say goodbye to counting hours at the end of the month and surprises in payslips. Also, the Punch Clock feature makes payroll processing much easier for managers and allows you to monitor your business in real time.\n\nCOMMUNICATION MADE EASY\nCommunicate with your whole team directly via SMS, group, or individual messages in the App. Managers can set reminders for shifts or events, so everyone is on the same page.\n\nYOUR DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ALL IN ONE PLACE\nEverything is signed and stored in the App, from contracts to salary and personal information. Additionally, you can set user access levels to ensure that everyones' personal data is secure and visible only to the relevant people.\n\nEVEN MORE FEATURES ON THE WEB \nThe web version of Planday allows you to take things one step further. You can create and export payroll and time reports, compare revenue to costs, and integrate with market-leading business Apps to provide a complete 360º activity overview.\n\nJoining an existing team? Just download the app and log in with the credentials provided by your Admin, it's free!"

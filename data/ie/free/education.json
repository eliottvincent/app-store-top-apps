      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Based on the most up-to-date questions for the Car (category B) and Motorcycle (category A) Driver Theory Test Ireland.\n\nWhether you have one day or one month to revise, it’s the best way to prepare. Master all of the topics and you’ll be guaranteed to pass. \n\n\n=========================\n7 REASONS TO GET IT\n=========================\n\n\n1. LATEST QUESTIONS – Based on the newest Driver Theory Test (DTT) service catalogue of Ireland. It has more FREE questions than most other apps. The full version has 958 questions for the car & motorcycle tests, covering all topics in just as much detail as the official book. \n\n2. CONVENIENCE – Easier to carry around than the book. This app does not require an Internet connection as the official online tool does.\n\n3. MOCK TESTS – Simulate the real test. Questions are randomly selected so there are almost an unlimited number of tests available. \n\n4. PRACTISE QUESTIONS – Get immediate feedback when you are wrong. This is by far the most effective way to learn.\n\n5. STUDY GUIDES – Do you have time to read the whole of The Rules of the Road? If not, our study guides are the answer. These focus only on what is actually covered in the theory tests.\n\n6. TRACK PROGRESS – Review performance, learn from the mistakes and monitor the progress you make.\n\n7. EASY TO USE INTERFACE – The clean layout and ease of navigating, take the stress out of studying. \n\n\n\n========================\nCOPYRIGHT AND DISCLAIMER\n========================\n\nThe questions and answers presented are based on those in the Driver Theory Test service catalogue of Ireland, but are not identical. You will receive questions with different content in your driver theory test.\n\nThe testable materials are reproduced from \"The Rules of the Road\" under the PSI General Licence 2005/08/01.

Curious? Here's what you need to know:\n\n****Leadership is a mindset, not a title****\nWhether you're leading yourself, a team, or an entire company, you have what it takes to be a great leader. Once you've got the mindset, you just need the tools. That's where BUNCH comes in!\n\n****Become the leader YOU want to be****\nNo two leaders are alike. That's why BUNCH uses psychology & AI to create a completely unique learning journey tailored for your leadership style, your role, and your interests - so you can build the skills that matter to you and your team.\n\n****Straight to the point with no fluff****\nEach day you'll get a bite-sized leadership tip that distills one key concept that's relevant for you, inspired & vetted by real-world leaders. They're designed to understood and remembered - like getting a summary of the best blog post you ever read.\n\n****Learn, act, reflect, repeat****\nTrue, stable growth comes from improving 1% every day. Get your tip, take action, and see how it goes. There is no try, only do!\n\n****Top 5 signs you should get BUNCH****\n=> You love to learn but don't have time to read every book or comb through every HBR article\n=> You want to empower those around you to do their best work but don’t know how\n=> You’re frustrated with your team: missed deadlines, re-work, slow progress\n=> You keep running into the same problems on project after project\n=> It feels like there’s always too much work and not enough time\n\nJoin a movement alongside 40,000+ other leaders. Here’s what they’re saying:\n\n\"After using BUNCH for a few months, I find it to be a helpful tool with constantly new and updated tips on leadership, it is eye opening for me in fields I have not explored before. I can recommend it to anyone responsible for a team's performance. Added bonus is that it comes with a community of leaders I can discuss related-topics with, and get specific advice.\" - Nader Alexan, CTO @ Airteam\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH user for months now, and there aren't many services that I'm this excited about! I genuinely believe it can be the lever to catapult your career or business - especially if you don't have time to read all the latest management books and HBR articles, but you still need to lead people in your work.\" - Srđan Stanić, Software Engineer at Gravitus\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH beta tester since the very beginning. Over the last year I've watched the app and the content grow into a truly meaningful product experience. Leaders at all levels can benefit from adopting the 2-minute daily habit. I love binging on tips in my free time, and often share content with my team.\" - Merissa Silk, Head of Product @ fundingport\n\n\"I almost dislike how popular BUNCH is becoming because as a beta user, it always felt like my own personal secret weapon! The coach makes it easy to have a moment of reflection each day, and having met the team behind it, I know they’re serious about their mission and vision to enable anyone to be a better leader.\" - Javier Gutiérrez Boronat, Agile Coach & Entrepreneurship Facilitator\n\n“Bunch gave me a template for how to call out team members who’ve gone above and beyond. The team loves it, and It’s really helped them gain a sense of what excellence looks like in their role.” - Cynthia Gordon, Customer Experience Leader @ [monday.com](http://monday.com/)\n\nReady to take the lead?

The 1Question app is a new approach to managing screen time, which helps make screen time productive and makes learning fun. \n\n1Question is a fun, educational app for kids in which they learn to earn recreational screen time. Parents control the learning topics and get real-time progress reports.\n\n1Question requires kids to answer study questions, in a game-like format, to earn screen time. The app makes mastering Maths, English, and other educational material as easy as learning the latest TikTok moves. It was created by parents and teachers making it easy to use, plus it’s backed by research to help motivate learning and maximize engagement. And on top of that, it helps to reduce arguments over screen time! \n\nMuch like sneaking vegetables into a cake, 1Question is sneaking micro-learning moments into your child’s screen time.

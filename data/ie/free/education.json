From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Master all of the topics and you’ll be guaranteed to pass. \n\n\n=========================\n7 REASONS TO GET IT\n=========================\n\n\n1. LATEST QUESTIONS – Based on the newest Driver Theory Test (DTT) service catalogue of Ireland. It has more FREE questions than most other apps. The full version has 958 questions for the car & motorcycle tests, covering all topics in just as much detail as the official book. \n\n2. CONVENIENCE – Easier to carry around than the book. This app does not require an Internet connection as the official online tool does.\n\n3. MOCK TESTS – Simulate the real test. Questions are randomly selected so there are almost an unlimited number of tests available. \n\n4. PRACTISE QUESTIONS – Get immediate feedback when you are wrong. This is by far the most effective way to learn.\n\n5. STUDY GUIDES – Do you have time to read the whole of The Rules of the Road? If not, our study guides are the answer. These focus only on what is actually covered in the theory tests.\n\n6. TRACK PROGRESS – Review performance, learn from the mistakes and monitor the progress you make.\n\n7. EASY TO USE INTERFACE – The clean layout and ease of navigating, take the stress out of studying. \n\n\n\n========================\nCOPYRIGHT AND DISCLAIMER\n========================\n\nThe questions and answers presented are based on those in the Driver Theory Test service catalogue of Ireland, but are not identical. You will receive questions with different content in your driver theory test.\n\nThe testable materials are reproduced from \"The Rules of the Road\" under the PSI General Licence 2005/08/01. The Road Safety Authority of Ireland (RSA) retains copyright ownership.\nDisclaimer: All efforts have been made to ensure the contents of The Rules of the Road in the app are as accurate as possible.

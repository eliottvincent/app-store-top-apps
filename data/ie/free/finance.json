      "label": "The free and easy solution to share your expenses with others. Create or check your tricount now to add your expenses.\n\nUsed by millions of people because short reckonings make long friends :-)!\n\nVery practical for holidays, housesharing, events, couples evenings, etc.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n• A clean and simple interface.\n• If you want, share accounts with a group: everyone will see them and can add their own expenses.\n• Divide expenses unevenly: good for travelling with couples or children, for example.\n• Works with the app and online: accounts are visible in the app, but also online!\n• Works offline to ensure perfect use in every part of the world... even on the beach!\n• You can turn on notifications to see if others are adding or editing expenses, and link your tricount list to your email address.\n\nWHAT USERS SAY:\n\n\"The best expenses app I've ever downloaded. The app is very intuitive\" - Michael P.\n\"Makes sharing bills with friends so much easier, many useful options, an absolute must have.\" - Tom C.\n\"Super useful - my flatmates and I can't live without it anymore!\" Sarah P.\n\nTHEY RECOMMEND TRICOUNT :\n\nFORBES:\n\"With Tricount, you can create a group expense report on your phone. It tracks spending by person, and then splits up how much each individual owes or is owed from the total balance. When you’re ready to share the final breakdown, the app sends each person a link to Tricount’s site to review the data.\"\n\nBUSINESS INSIDER:\n\"Next time you organize a group activity, Tricount will split up the expenses for you\".\n\nABOUT IN-APP PURCHASES\n\nAs of version 2.1, Tricount offers in-App purchase subscriptions valid for one year. \n\nThe price of the subscription is 6.99€ (Premium) and may depend on your territory and is clearly indicated on the subscription page. Payment will be directly charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. The subscription renewal costs the same price as the one of the original subscription. After purchase, you can disable auto-renewal in your user's Account Settings. Note that no cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Tricount's terms and conditions are available at https://tricount.com/en/terms\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\ncreate a tricount, share your link with friends ... et voilà!\n\nTricount makes sorting out and divvying your group expenses very easy when you organize activities (for example: ski trip, citytrip, holidays with a classroom, flatmates etc.)\n\nGone are the days of the old excel file: an easier and effective solution exists to breakdown the costs, sharing expense reports, list tickets and spending. Tricount does the accounting and balances the cost for your group expenses.\n\nIt lets you breakdown the budget of a group and track expenses during a trip or any occasion with friends. It can be used by couples, between colleagues, roommates & flatmates. It is a simple yet powerful tool to figure out who owes what to whom and balance spendings : I owe you, you owe me (IOU) ... so easy!\n\nCreate your group expenses on your mobile (even offline), during your group activity. Send everyone the link (a la Doodle), and your friends too can add their own expense or see your changes.\n\nTricount then tells you who should pay what to whom to balance the group.\n\nVery useful for any activity with friends and colleagues: holiday, city-trip, flat sharing & flatmates, week-ends, everyday lunch with colleagues, parties, etc. In your couple, you can create a tricount to know who has paid what this month, or on holiday.\nThe app exists for most mobile devices, and on the web! All currencies are accepted, even bitcoins if you want."

Trading derivatives may not be suitable for all investors and you should seek independent advice if necessary.

The app allows you to securely authenticate your purchases when using your EBS debit card to shop online.\r\n\r\nFrom February 2021 onwards, when you shop online with your EBS debit card we will apply an extra layer of security and you will need to authenticate the transaction using the EBS CardManager app.\r\n\r\nThis extra security layer is where we apply what is known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). This helps fight fraudsters and further protect online transactions.\r\n\r\nHere is what you need to do:\r\n1. Download this EBS CardManager app.\r\n2. Open the EBS CardManager app. You will be prompted on screen to enter your date of birth and your mobile number.\r\n3. We will then ask you to authenticate your mobile phone by ringing our customer care number displayed on screen and providing a code word sent to your phone. A member of our customer care team will ask you to read this code word out, and this will authenticate your phone. This will link your phone and the app to your EBS debit card.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you have set this up your SCA, you won’t have to do it again and you can continue to shop online securely using the app to authenticate your purchases."

You will need a one time activation code from us to setup the app for SCA.\r\n\r\nHere is what you need to do:\r\n1. Download this EBS Authenticator app. \r\n2. Open the EBS Authenticator app. You will be prompted on screen to enter your Customer ID number and Personal Access Code (PAC) as normal, followed by the 6-digit one time activation code which we send to you by post.\r\n\r\nOnce you have done this you’ll be able to complete SCA at login and use EBS Your Accounts Online."

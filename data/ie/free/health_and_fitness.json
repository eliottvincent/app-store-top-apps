      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

With over 20,000 trained, experienced, and accredited therapists covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it.\n \n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 20,000 licensed, accredited, and highly experienced therapists\n• Match with an available therapist who best fits your needs\n• Unlimited private one on one communication with your therapist\n• Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secure messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars\n \nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n \nLICENSED AND TRAINED therapistS & THERAPISTS\nThere are over 20,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n \nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n \nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n \nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n \nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason."

      "label": "WHOOP is your personalized digital fitness and health coach. Get the all-new WHOOP 4.0, our most advanced WHOOP yet, and pair it with your phone to unlock powerful personal insights, available directly in the WHOOP app.\n\nThe WHOOP app does so much more than track activity. WHOOP monitors your physiological data 24/7 to provide you with insights into your sleep habits, training, recovery, and overall health. WHOOP calibrates to your data over time, giving you personalized recommendations and coaching on what you can do – from when to go to bed to what behaviors to adopt – to optimize your performance and your health. This app requires a WHOOP wearable.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nSleep: Every night, WHOOP calculates your sleep performance by measuring the sleep you got compared to the sleep your body needs. You’ll wake up to a sleep score from 0 to 100%. Sleep Coach lets you know when you should go to bed to optimize your performance the following day. Now, with the release of WHOOP 4.0, Sleep Coach can also wake you when you’ve set an exact time, once you’ve reached your sleep goal, or when you’re fully recovered using a quiet, vibrating haptic alarm.\n\nStrain: WHOOP does more than just track your activity – it measures how much physical and mental stress you put on yourself throughout your entire day. WHOOP considers your exercise, work, errands, travel, parenting, and more to calculate a daily Strain score ranging from 0 to 21. Strain Coach then recommends your optimal target exertion range based on your Recovery score to help you maximize your gains without sacrificing your Recovery.\n\nRecovery: WHOOP lets you know how ready you are to perform by measuring your heart-rate variability, resting heart rate, sleep, and respiratory rate. You’ll get a daily Recovery score on a scale of 0 to 100%. When you’re in the green, you’re ready for strain, when you’re in the yellow or red, you may want to evaluate your training program. \n\nHealth: With the all-new WHOOP 4.0, you can now get a big-picture look at your overall health. The new WHOOP 4.0 features an SPO2 sensor and skin temperature sensor to measure your blood oxygen levels and skin temperature, in addition to your heart rate, resting heart rate, and heart-rate variability. You can easily see when your health is improving, or when you might be deviating from your baseline due to stress, illness, and more. Plus, you can download your personalized health reports to send to your physician, coach, or family.\n\nWhat else you can do in the WHOOP app:\n• Behavioral journal: Log daily behaviors – alcohol, nutrition, caffeine, meditation, electronic usage, stress and more – to see which choices impact your performance most\n• Dive into your weekly & monthly performance: Weekly and monthly Performance Assessments give you a better look at how individual behaviors and choices add to or detract from your performance\n• Join a team: Stay motivated and accountable by joining a team. Chat directly with your teammates in the app, or as a coach, see how your team’s training is going.\n• WHOOP Live: Overlay real-time Recovery, Sleep, Strain or heart-rate data onto your videos\n• Get help: Membership Services is available to answer any of your questions directly from the app\n• AMA: WHOOP experts are available weekly to answer your burning questions \n• Apple Health: WHOOP integrates with Apple’s Health app to sync activities and personalize your experience\n• Menstrual Cycle Coaching: Members who have a natural menstrual cycle gain strain and sleep coaching recommendations to account for monthly hormonal changes\n\n* Continued use of GPS and Bluetooth running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Each week the workout plan will be updated according to your progress and feedback (if the previous workouts were too easy or too difficult for you).\nAdditionally, you will have access to a library of 200+ workouts.\n\nAlso, the recipes database is included in the app (available in English only).\n\nHEALTHKIT:\nMuscle Booster integrates with HealthKit, so you can export nutrition and exercise data from Muscle Booster to HealthKit, and import fitness data and weight and body measurements from HealthKit to Muscle Booster.\n \nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\nYou can download the app for free.

      "label": "Wake up fresh with the revolutionary motion-sensing sleep tracker and smart alarm clock app. \n\nSleepwave has invented new “silent sonar” technology to sense movements near your phone. We use this to track your sleep, wake you up better with gentle alarm sounds, and power unique visualizations that respond to your movement.\n\nSMART ALARM\n• Wake up better and feel more energized with Sleepwave’s motion-sensing smart alarm. Set a time window around when you need to wake up and the smart alarm clock will sound when you’re naturally awakening. \n\nSLEEP TRACKING\n• Sleepwave transforms your phone into a contactless sleep tracker using silent sonar technology. With detailed, easy-to-understand charts and graphs, you can understand your sleep cycle, patterns and habits over time. \n\nRELAX, FOCUS AND PLAY WITH WAVESCAPES \n• Wavescapes are interactive visualizations that respond to your movements without having to touch your phone. Choose and play with different patterns to help refresh or focus your mind. \n\nFALL ASLEEP AND WAKE UP WITH SOOTHING SOUNDS \n• Why should a wake up be alarming? Choose from original alarm sounds composed by renowned musicians, or wake up gently with a \"soft awakening\" soundscape before the main alarm. At night, you can fall asleep to a collection of sounds from the natural world. \n\nHAPTIC SMART ALARM FOR APPLE WATCH\n• Sleepwave’s haptic smart alarm for the Apple Watch is linked to your body movements. Rather than setting a fixed alarm time, you set a 15-minute time window and Sleepwave will wake you up at a great moment with silent taps on your wrist. \n\nAPPLE MUSIC AND APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION\n• Fall asleep or wake up to your favorite music or select from playlists specifically designed for sleep.\n• Write your sleep data to Apple Health.\n\nRESPECT FOR YOUR PRIVACY\n• No login is required to use the app. We don’t collect your personal details. Sleepwave uses your phone’s microphone to detect movement but no audio data leaves your phone. \n\nNON-JUDGEMENTAL \n• Everybody’s sleep is different. If you stay out late with your friends, Sleepwave is a sleep tracker that won’t judge you with a bad sleep score. Instead, the app empowers you to understand your sleep and set your own goals.\n\nGENEROUS FREE FEATURES\n• Smart alarm and sleep tracking are free for everyone. Some additional features are accessed with a great value annual subscription.\n\nSleepwave Premium gives you:\n\n• Detailed breakdown of sleep stages showing light, deep and REM sleep\n• Weekly, monthly and yearly sleep patterns\n• More Wavescapes to help you focus, relax and play\n• Soft awakening feature to ease your wake up \n• More alarm sounds\n• Apple Music integration \n• Soothing sounds to help you fall asleep\n• Additional color themes\n• More premium features coming soon\n\nSLEEPWAVE SUBSCRIPTION TERMS\n\nSleepwave offers a 7-day free trial as well as a free version. If you choose to subscribe, you will be charged a yearly subscription fee according to your country. The subscription fee will be shown in the app before you complete the payment. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each subscription term unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the term. Subscription renewals cost the same as the original subscription, and your credit card will be charged through your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYou may manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal at any time after purchase by going to your iTunes Account Settings. Refunds will not be given for any unused portion of the term.\n\nFor additional information, please read our Terms of Service (https://sleepwave.com/terms-conditions/) and Privacy Policy (https://sleepwave.com/privacy-policy/)"

Start listening to one of our stories and fall asleep gently and deeply. Our narrators will lead you into sweet dreams and restful sleep. It works like magic!\n\nOur library contains 200+ lessons and gets bigger day by day. You will find new items every week. Moreover, you will also be able to record your progress on Apple Health. The most loved meditations are:\n– Antistress\n– Concentration and productivity\n– Sleep meditation\n– Personal relationships\n– Happiness and gratitude\n– Self-esteem\n\nThe free basic course will introduce you to the theoretical principles of meditation and will propose some practical exercises.

This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I.

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

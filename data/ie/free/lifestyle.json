      "label": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off dating apps. And it’s working. Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only."

      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

      "label": "I Am Sober is more than just a free sobriety counter app.\n\nAlong with tracking your sober days, it helps you build new habits and provides ongoing motivation by connecting you to a wide network of people all striving for the same goal: staying sober one day at a time.\n\nThrough our growing sober community you can learn from others and contribute by sharing insights and tactics that have worked for you.\n\n**The I Am Sober app features:**\n\n• Sober day tracker\nTo visualize how long you’ve been sober.\n\n• Remember why you quit\nAdd reasons and photos to help you remember why you want to quit your addiction and stay sober.\n\n• Daily pledge tracker\nTake a pledge every day. Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

You can now use this app to control your Philips Hue smart Bluetooth lights!*  \n\nOrganize your smart lights your way \nWhether you use just a few bulbs or have completely outfitted your home in Philips Hue, you can organize your smart lights with ease. Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

Summer, previously known as Spark, is the fastest-growing new dating app that allows you to spend less time swiping and more time dating. On Summer, we show you users who are closest to you. It’s like being at the bar and scanning the room, except on Summer, you know who’s single, and you don’t have to leave the house.\n\nConnecting with new people in your area has never been easier. Swiping can make us overanalyze our choices and second-guess ourselves. No one wants to be reduced to a right or left swipe. Plus, no more accidentally swiping left on someone you actually like and wondering if they’ll ever pop up again! With Summer, everyone nearby is laid out in front of you so you can see who catches your eye, learn more about them, and spark up a conversation.\n\nSo you might be wondering, “this sounds too good to be true; what’s the catch?” Well, there isn’t one! Summer is here to revolutionize the dating space for good. Once you send a like, that person has 24 hours to like you back or send you a message. We’re all busy- we don’t have time to wait days or even months for a match.\n\nDate more, swipe less.\n\nPrivacy: https://www.summerdating.com/privacy-policy\n\nTerms: https://www.summerdating.com/terms-of-service"

      "label": "imoo watch phone is a product designed for children and parents. The app can be connected with the watch by wearing the watch on the children’s wrist and its supporting app on the parents’ mobile phone. Parents can make mutual calls between the watch and the mobile phone, accurately locate the children’s position, and send voice message between the app and the watch by setting watch-related functions in the app. \nMain Functional Features:\n1.Phone Function:\nThe phone module is installed in the hardware of the watch to allow calls between the phone and the watch, and between watches, thereby making communication and connection between parents and children more convenient. In addition, the watch can be switched freely between regular and privacy mode, making calls more comfortable.\n2.Location Function:\nA GPS chip and WiFi module are installed in the hardware of the watch, enabling the APP to show the precise position of the watch whether outdoors or indoors.\n3.Chat Function:\nVoice messages can be sent between the watch and the APP, realizing a new form of communication between children and parents. In addition, the APP can send SMS text messages to the watch for greater diversity of communication. \n4.Soaking Reminder: \nIf the watch is accidentally immersed in water, the screen will light up to remind the child to stop using it. The APP will also send a message to the parents notifying them to contact the child. \n5.Schedule Alarm: \nParents can set up and manage the daily schedule of the child through schedule alarms that remind the child to drink water, do homework and other matters by means of regular reminders, customized voice reminders, etc., enabling the child to gradually develop good time keeping habits.\n6.SMS:\nThe watch will only receive messages from contacts in its address list and reject messages from strangers, thereby protecting the child from being affected by unwanted or harassing messages.\n7.Step Counting Function:\nThe child’s number of steps can be viewed on the watch in order to help the parents record the child’s progress step by step and ensure their healthy growth. \n8.Class Mode:\nParents can set the times of the child’s classes. When the child attends school wearing the watch, they will not be distracted from learning by playing with the watch.\n9.Contacts:\nParents can use the APP to manage the contacts on their child’s watch, thereby making sure that their child will not be harassed by unknown calls while also preventing their child from making random calls.\n10.Unknown Call Rejection:\nWhen the unknown call rejection function is activated through the APP, only the contacts in the address list can make calls to the watch, and strangers will be blocked. If receiving unknown calls, the APP will receive a notification message, giving the parents a chance to confirm the call. \n11.Auto Answer:\nWith the auto answer function activated through the APP, if the parents call the child and there is no answer, the watch will automatically connect after 10 seconds.\n12.Call Location Report:\nWhen the watch calls the phone, it automatically reports the location of the call to the parents.\n13.Low Power Mode\nWith the reserve power function activated, when the power level of the watch drops too low, it will automatically enter low power mode, conveniently saving power for the parents to contact the child when required.\n\nNote: This feature is not available on some models."

Sometimes, that’s the name of the game, especially when it comes to meeting new people online for casual dating, NSA meetups, random chats, or just a good time.\n\nThat’s why we created Kasual: the best hook up app that respects your personal life while introducing you to people in your area.\n\nHere's How Kasual Works\n\n* We never ask you for any personal information. Not your Facebook, phone number, email... nothing. You’re here to chat with a potential match, and that’s all that matters to us. Have fun, with no strings attached.\n\n* We don't require your face to be in any of your pictures, Kasual has a built-in photo editor. Blur your pic, cover your face with emojis, add a mosaic effect… whatever! Get creative while protecting your privacy.\n\n* Hooking up with new people is even more fun, with Kasual Cards. Choose 1 of 4 default cards; flip it over; and hey! You’ve got a 50% chance of finding someone in your area. Ready for your next casual encounter?\n\n* You don’t need to pay to send a message — it's 100% free to chat with your mutual matches, and the people you see after you've flipped over their card.\n\n* Kasual is for everybody who is at least 18 years old. Straight, gay, lesbian, bi, trans, singles and couples, everyone is welcome with Kasual, and it all starts with a random flip.\n\nKasual is free to download, so get it now.

And unlike instructions online, BILT doesn’t allow ads or annoying pop-ups. The platform is paid for by hundreds of leading brands that believe you deserve a better experience with their products. These participating brands provide 3D instructions as a service because BILT users are happier with their purchases and have fewer returns. It’s a win-win!\n\n\n\nNO SIGN IN!\nYou do not need to provide any personal information or create an account to use BILT. We’re serious about making it easy.\n\nBut there are benefits to creating a BILT account: \n- Save your receipt\n- Register a product\n- Access warranty information\n- Keep downloaded instructions in “My Stuff” to access later\n- Leave a rating & review to help your favorite brands improve their products over time\n\n\n\nAWARDS\n- Most Innovative Construction Tool, National Association of Home Builders\n- Gold Winner, User Experience Awards\n- Winner, Pro Tool Innovation Awards\n\n\n\nBILT TOOLBOX\nThe BILT Toolbox is a collection of instructions to help you with home, auto, and safety projects, as well as guides for basic power tools. Follow easy BILT instructions to fix a toilet, lay bathroom tile, paint a room, jump a car battery, change a tire, use a circular saw, adjust a bicycle, repair drywall, and so much more to help with anything adulthood sends your way.\n\nWe use the BILT Toolbox too, so if we have a question about something, we design an instruction for it. We welcome your suggestions, too. From personal experience we recommend downloading “How to Jump a Car Battery” before you need it because internet connections at soccer fields can be spotty. :)\n\n\n\nDATA PRIVACY\nWe do not collect personal data other than what you choose to provide if you create an account, register a product, or leave a review. \n\nWe do collect aggregate data such as the number of downloads for each product and the average time it takes to complete an instruction step, but it cannot be tied to an individual user.\n\n\n\nFEEDBACK FROM OUR USERS\n- “I really like putting things together, but the BILT app made it a breeze! A fun little activity and a great outcome. I’m a visual learner so I really appreciate a 3D option with parts clearly labeled!! I could build a million things with the help of this app particularly. Highly recommend!!!”\n\n- \"I'm telling you, I could easily engineer a space craft if they had the directions on BILT.\"\n\n- \"I usually shy away from putting stuff together but this helped me a lot. I’m proud of myself.”\n\n- “Made it very easy, I didn’t cuss or throw anything.”\n\n- “My husband & I are NOT handy people. However, with the BILT app we were able to correctly put together a grill in a couple hours with NO arguments! LOL! This app may have saved our marriage. I highly recommend this app.”\n\n- \"Extremely easy and very convenient. Thank you for making my life a little bit easier.\"\n\n- “For someone who is an auditory learner, this is great. Thanks. Love that I can review assembly instructions even before it ships and then use the app once things are unpacked. Plus, it will always be there should I ever need it again. Just brilliant!”\n\n\n\nDo it right the first time and download BILT now!"

From the virtual Layout Assistant, to one-touch RGB presets, to full in-depth customization like you’ve never seen before, prepare for a lighting experience that is Smarter by Design. \n\nSimple Control\nUse the App to scan your lights’ pairing code and get set up in seconds, then enjoy your smart light-switch. Remotely turn your lights on and off, adjust brightness (trust us they go BRIGHT), and select your color Scenes from anywhere within your home. Group your lights together for joint control with Group Scenes (because we love a team player), or segment by room to keep your lights as organized as you wish your life could be.\n\nComplete Customization\nCreate custom dynamic Scenes by selecting palettes and colors with the intuitive color wheel, adjusting ratios, and choosing animated motions. Try vibrant RGB hues to set a total vibe, or put the “fun” in functional lighting with the whole range of white color temperatures.\n\nAdvanced Automations\nSet Schedules to automate your daily lighting needs, from gentle morning light-alarms, to gradually dimming nightly reminders that Holy **** it’s 2AM again, you need to wake up in 4 hours, PLEASE go to sleep. \n\nNow You’re Talking\nConnect your lights with your smart home assistant (HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Samsung SmartThings) and use voice commands to control them hands-free. Just say “Hey Siri, turn on my “TGIF” Scene” and instantly enter full relaxation-mode at the end of a long week. The best part of all, you don’t even have to say “Please”... but it’d still be nice if you did though :)\n\nJoin the Community\nExplore the App’s “Discover” tab for a huge collection of incredible Scenes created by users like you. Well, like you, just more creative. But if you too are the creative type, share your own Scenes and show the community what you’ve got! There are endless Scenes to discover for every mood and occasion, all the way from “Ho Ho Holidays” to “Netflix and Chill”.\n\n+ More\nWith a virtual AR Layout Assistant, curated Scenes and Playlists, Cloud Control (requires Apple home hub), and additional product information, the Nanoleaf App really is your smart lighting one-stop-shop.\n\n\nThe Nanoleaf App supports Nanoleaf Light Panels, Canvas, Shapes, Essentials, Elements, and Lines. \n\nEnjoy it today on the ever superior iOS operating system."

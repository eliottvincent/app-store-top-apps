Now one of the leading literary journals published in English, it is read all over the world—and forms the nexus of a warm and active community.\n\nWe believe that the great art that has emerged from these faith traditions is dramatic, not didactic—incarnational, not abstract. And so our focus has been on works of imagination that embody a spiritual struggle, like Jacob wrestling with the angel. In our pages the larger questions of existence intersect with what the poet Albert Goldbarth calls the “greasy doorknobs and salty tearducts” of our everyday lives.\n\nPricing for subscriptions available: \n• Single issue: $9.99\n• 1 year subscription: $29.99, automatically renewed until cancelled \n\nWhen purchasing through iTunes your account will be charged at confirmation of purchase. \nYour subscription will auto-renew unless you turn this off 24 hours before the subscription runs out.

The recipes are still quick to prepare, thanks to our time-saving tricks and clever shortcuts, but they look really impressive and taste wonderful.  \n \nGET BAKING is where we show you how to get perfect results every time with our straightforward, delicious recipes for sweet and savoury bakes. There are everyday ideas - perfect for lunchboxes, for example - and special occasion treats too.\n \nTV COOKS - here we bring you the very best ideas from the BBC’s talented TV cooks, with recipes chosen because they’re easy to make and because they offer you the chance to try out ingredients or flavour combinations you might not have used before.  \n \nEASY COOK COOKERY SCHOOL - Each month you can learn  a new technique or skill, designed to speed up your cooking and help you make the most of the time you spend in the kitchen.

      "label": "Noa brings you the world’s best journalism, curated by editors and read aloud by professional voice actors. We aim to provide multiple perspectives on trending news topics, through a highly involved curation process where Noa’s editors hand-pick the very best articles from the world's best publishers.\n\nIn a world with polarised opinions and ideology-driven media coverage, are you seeking multiple viewpoints? Start listening to Noa to save you time in exploring varying perspectives and to help you stay informed on the topics everyone is talking about.\n\nIt integrates easily into your daily or weekly routine. Listen while exercising, driving, cooking, or walking.\n\nTOP PUBLISHERS.

Storytellers: Be storytellers and educators. Help our listeners understand global topics, and perspectives, while also telling the stories of the people behind the headlines.\n4.

Audio articles are produced and recorded daily by Noa’s talented voice actors – Sam Scholl, Adrienne Walker, Peter Hanly, Martin Buchanan, Les Smith, Grainne Brookfield and Jessie McGee. They’re probably in the booth recording as you read this!\n\nAUDIO SERIES\nEach day, Noa’s editor’s select the very best audio articles and add them to topic-specific playlists. Every Series begins with a short explainer – written by a Noa editor – that provides valuable context on the subject at hand before you dive in. Within 20-30 minutes, you’ll walk away fully informed.\n\nAUDIO FEATURES\nAlong with the usual audio features, you’ll find: CarPlay, AirPlay, Offline Mode, Sleep Timer, Playback Speed Adjustment, an editable Article Queue, and Rewind and Fast-forward.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nWe know you expect more. That’s why the Noa app also offers:\n• In-app chat (we respond quickly)\n• My Stats to view your daily streak and listening stats\n• Save, Download, and Follow\n• Share – articles and Series\n• Read Along\n\nALWAYS FREE\nYou can listen to the free tier of Noa without any need to pay.

We would love to welcome you as a member of Noa’s growing community.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY\nWe’re real people, just like you and we take great care to protect your data. Noa does not share your data with others or allow advertisers to track you. Your data is used solely for the purpose of providing you with the best news, learning, and listening experience possible.\n\nPrivacy: https://www.newsoveraudio.com/privacy\nTerms: https://www.newsoveraudio.com/terms"

      "label": "Dis-Leur que c'est plus de liberté\n\nDis-Leur ! c'est un média créé en 2017 par Philippe Mouret et Olivier Schlama, 30 ans d’expérience dans la presse. C'est le résultat de nos réflexions après avoir vu et vécu la dégradation des contenus dans la presse traditionnelle. Nous avons choisi de reprendre notre liberté et de renouer avec les valeurs d'une profession qui nous est chère. Renouer avec les lecteurs, sur le terrain, avec le plaisir de faire des choix dans une totale indépendance rédactionnelle... Vous offrir des sujets de réflexion, de débat, vous faire une opinion à la lumière d'informations vérifiées et analysées.\n\nDans une société en perte de repères, dans une presse en crise, il s'agit d'un journalisme positif. Qui prend son temps et de la hauteur : grands entretiens, reportages... Du journalisme en immersion qui revient aux sources à l'heure où s'impose plus que jamais le décryptage de l'information et des grands défis de la société.\n\nDis-Leur ! que c'est plus de proximité\n\nLa liberté et l'indépendance, mais aussi la proximité. Dis-Leur a choisi de raconter son époque en se plaçant au plus près du réel et au-delà de Paris. A contre-courant du flux d’information en continu. Dans une région riche de contrastes et de créativité, il suffit de se tourner d'est en ouest et du nord au sud pour découvrir une formidable richesse patrimoniale qui ne fait que souligner la multiplication des expériences innovantes. Urbaine et rurale, culturelle et sportive, la région Occitanie Pyrénées-Méditerranée est une terre pleine de sujets à découvrir... Cette région, notre région, votre région, nous lui offrons un écrin original et nous vous invitons à le partager.\n\nDis-Leur ! que les lecteurs sont au coeur du projet\n\nPour prendre de la distance avec la religion de \"l'actu chaude\" en continu, qui survole tous les sujets sans en traiter aucun, notre volonté est de privilégier la lecture et la découverte d'une information bien traitée en lien avec le quotidien. Pour réussir cette rupture, le lecteur est au coeur de la démarche, il est le premier à nous transmettre ses idées, à faire émerger les sujets qui seront développés sur le site et les initiatives qui font bouger la région. Le lecteur de Dis-Leur ! c'est aussi sa première source d'info. Il lui suffit pour cela de nous écrire afin de suggérer ses \"bons plans\", des initiatives dignes d'intérêt, ses préoccupations du quotidien...\n\nDis-Leur ! de s'abonner\n\nPour faire vivre un média en toute indépendance, il est nécessaire d'être soutenus et que les lecteurs s'abonnent... Le site existe et se développe avec des infos nouvelles chaque jour, une application sera disponible dans quelques jours. Comme ils nous inspirent des sujets, nos lecteurs peuvent aussi nous soutenir en partageant le site tout autour d'eux, mais aussi et surtout en s'abonnant depuis l'application. \nAu sein de l'application, vous pouvez souscrire à l'abonnement Premium suivant deux formules, l'une mensuelle, l'autre annuelle et donnant accès à l'intégralité des articles \"Premium\". Les abonnements sont gérés par iTunes d'Apple, et implique les conditions suivantes :\n• Les abonnements sont souscrit soit pour une durée d'un mois, soit pour une durée d'un an\n• Le paiement sera débité du compte iTunes à la confirmation de l'achat\n• L'abonnement est automatiquement renouvelé, sauf si le renouvellement automatique est désactivé au moins 24 heures avant la fin de la période en cours.\n• Le compte sera facturé pour le renouvellement dans les 24 heures avant la fin de la période en cours\n• Les abonnements peuvent être gérés par l'utilisateur et le renouvellement automatique peut être désactivé en accédant aux paramètres du compte de l'utilisateur après l'achat.\n• Toute portion inutilisée d'une période d'essai gratuite, si elle est offerte, sera perdue lorsque l'utilisateur achète un abonnement à cette publication, le cas échéant.\nVous pouvez consulter nos conditions générales de ventes à cette url : https://dis-leur.fr/cgv/"

Our mission is to help you make positive yet realistic changes that will bring you long-term benefits – we're not about fad diets or false promises. Each issue is like having your own personal dietitian in your bag. \n\nStarting with the January issue, the magazine is going monthly, which means there will be 12 magazines instead of 10 in 2014. Plus, we're also defying convention by matching our cover month with the date the magazine actually goes on sale. So, quite simply, the January issue is out at the beginning of Jan, and February at the beginning of Feb. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a free app download with paid content within. The current issue, back issues and future issues can be purchased within the app. \n\nSubscriptions are also available within the application. When a recurring subscription is purchased the latest issue will become available to download immediately. \n\nAvailable subscriptions are: \n\n1 month: £2.99/ US$4.99 (1 issue) \n6 months: £14.99/ US$20.99 (6 issues) \n12 months: £27.49/ US$38.99 (12 issues) \n\n-The subscription will renew automatically unless cancelled more than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period, for the same duration and at the current subscription rate for the product. \n-You may turn off the auto-renewal of subscriptions through your Account Settings, however you are not able to cancel the current subscription during its active period. \n-Payment will charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when a subscription to that publication is purchased. \nBundles of single issues can be also be bought within the application. To use purchased credits, simply click on the issue price and select ‘use credit’. This allows you to purchase back issues at reduced prices. \n\nUsers can register for/ login to a pocketmags account in-app. This will protect their issues in the case of a lost device and allow browsing of purchases on multiple platforms. Existing pocketmags users can retrieve their purchases by logging into their account. \n\nWe recommend loading the app for the first time in a wi-fi area so that all issue data is retrieved. \nIf your app will not load past the splash page after a first install or an update please click the settings cog, then click Settings then Refresh app data. If this also fails to work please delete and reinstall the app from the App Store \n\nHelp and frequently asked questions be accessed in-app and on pocketmags. \nIf you have any problems at all please do not hesitate to contact us: help@pocketmags.com \n-------------------- \nYou can find our privacy policy here: \nhttp://www.pocketmags.com/privacy.aspx \n\nYou can find our terms and conditions here: \nhttp://www.pocketmags.com/terms.aspx"

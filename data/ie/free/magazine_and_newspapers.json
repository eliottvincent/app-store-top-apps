      "label": "Noa brings you the world’s best journalism, curated by editors and read aloud by professional voice actors. We aim to provide multiple perspectives on trending news topics, through a highly involved curation process where Noa’s editors hand-pick the very best articles from the world's best publishers.\n\nIn a world with polarised opinions and ideology-driven media coverage, are you seeking multiple viewpoints? Start listening to Noa to save you time in exploring varying perspectives and to help you stay informed on the topics everyone is talking about.\n\nIt integrates easily into your daily or weekly routine. Listen while exercising, driving, cooking, or walking.\n\nTOP PUBLISHERS. ONE APP\nOur partnering publishers include\n\n• The Economist\n• Harvard Business Review\n• The Washington Post\n• The Telegraph\n• Bloomberg\n• The New York Times\n• Fast Company\n• Insider\n• MIT Technology Review\n• Foreign Affairs\n• The Independent\n• The Conversation\n• And more.\n\nOUR EDITORIAL PRINCIPLES\t\n1. Multiple Perspectives: Offer multiple perspectives from trusted sources and empower listeners to make up their own minds on where they stand on a topic.\n2. Thought-provoking: Present audio articles that inform, inspire, and offer fresh insights, through both a global and a national lens. Focus on opinion, feature, and analysis articles.\n3. Storytellers: Be storytellers and educators. Help our listeners understand global topics, and perspectives, while also telling the stories of the people behind the headlines.\n4. Global Impact: Ensure coverage and raise awareness of important topics, regardless of a topics popularity or ability to drive “clicks”. \n5. Fourth Estate: Uphold journalism’s values as a democratic check on power. And always celebrate great journalism.\n6. Embrace Complexity: Encourage thought and avoid black and white explanations that aren't followed with depth. The world is complicated and can seldom be explained in minutes. Our goal is to help listeners navigate it. \n\nAUDIO STORIES\nListening to the best journalism is a great way to learn and grow, especially when you don’t have time to read. Audio articles are produced and recorded daily by Noa’s talented voice actors – Sam Scholl, Adrienne Walker, Peter Hanly, Martin Buchanan, Les Smith, Grainne Brookfield and Jessie McGee. They’re probably in the booth recording as you read this!\n\nAUDIO SERIES\nEach day, Noa’s editor’s select the very best audio articles and add them to topic-specific playlists. Every Series begins with a short explainer – written by a Noa editor – that provides valuable context on the subject at hand before you dive in. Within 20-30 minutes, you’ll walk away fully informed.\n\nAUDIO FEATURES\nAlong with the usual audio features, you’ll find: CarPlay, AirPlay, Offline Mode, Sleep Timer, Playback Speed Adjustment, an editable Article Queue, and Rewind and Fast-forward.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nWe know you expect more. That’s why the Noa app also offers:\n• In-app chat (we respond quickly)\n• My Stats to view your daily streak and listening stats\n• Save, Download, and Follow\n• Share – articles and Series\n• Read Along\n\nALWAYS FREE\nYou can listen to the free tier of Noa without any need to pay. You’ll get a weekly article allowance and access to most of our publishers.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES\nBy choosing to support Noa with a monthly or annual subscription you’ll get unlimited, ad-free access to over 18k audio articles (and counting) from the world’s best publishers, including our Premium-only publications. We would love to welcome you as a member of Noa’s growing community.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY\nWe’re real people, just like you and we take great care to protect your data. Noa does not share your data with others or allow advertisers to track you. Your data is used solely for the purpose of providing you with the best news, learning, and listening experience possible.\n\nPrivacy: https://www.newsoveraudio.com/privacy\nTerms: https://www.newsoveraudio.com/terms"

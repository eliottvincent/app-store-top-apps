      "label": "The COVID Tracker App can help reduce the spread of coronavirus in Ireland and help everyone stay safe.\n\nIt's easy:\n\n- download the app\n- choose what information you want to share, or not\n- that's it, you are now part of the contact tracing community, helping to keep everyone safe from coronavirus.\n\nIf you use the app you will:\n\n-be alerted if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus\n-be able to track your symptoms and get advice on what to do\n-have the choice to anonymously warn others if you test positive for coronavirus - this will help keep other people safe\n-protect yourself and others as everyone begins to return to normal life\n\nHow the COVID Tracker app works\nThe app has 3 functions:\n\ncontact tracing\nCOVID check-in\nupdates and information\n\n1. Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

We may need a rash identifier, a mole checker, a skin analyzer, or an acne scanner, depending on the problem. The AI-Dermatologist app combines all these functions. We have designed this modern skin analyzer so that by using it on a regular basis, if you suspect a problem, you can contact your healthcare providers in time and avoid complications.\n\nBased on today's most advanced Artificial intelligence technologies and professional knowledge and expertise in dermatology, our application enables you to check all your skin problems for risk assessment: spots, birthmarks, acne, moles or papillomas. In 1 minute AI-Dermatologist gives a result on the next step to be taken. Likewise, AI-Dermatologist gives you the opportunity to store photos to keep track of changes over time and monitor your skin health in the long run. By creating AI-Dermatologist, we supported the idea of making skin screening and monitoring accessible to everyone.\n\nWith AI-Dermatologist you can:\n- Snapshot your skin spots, birth-marks, mole or another skin diseases such as: angioma, warts, papillomas, mollusks and etc.\n- Take / upload photos and track results for changes\n- Get a reminder when it is time to take a new photo, take pills or build a skin care routine \n- Сreate your own scheme for the medicines or cosmetics’ use according to your schedule \n- Track dynamics of baseline and follow-up results\n- Easily log the tracked your skin conditions locations on your body\n\nPlease note that AI-Dermatologist is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace or cancel a visit to your doctor. This application aims to help you be more aware of your skin condition via self-exams, but it is not an online dermatology platform. If you ever feel uncomfortable or see that your skin spot is changing, irritated, itchy or bleeding, we strongly recommend that you contact a medical specialist without hesitation to avoid the risk of melanoma or other skin diseases.\n\nBy signing up for this subscription, you agree to our\nTerms of use http://ai-derm.com/terms/terms_of_use.html\nPrivacy Policy http://ai-derm.com/privacy/privacy.html"

      "label": "The incidence of skin cancer has increased steadily worldwide in recent years. Statistically, the probability of developing skin cancer once in a lifetime is about 20%. Early detection is of extreme importance. The earlier skin cancer can be detected, the better the chances of recovery. This is why our group of dermatologists and biomedical engineers have developed SkinScreener, a smart way to determine the personal risk of altered skin areas with an app, in addition to regular dermatological examinations. \n\nA clinical study at the Medical University of Graz (using more than 1500 images of real patients) has proven that SkinScreener has an impressive 95% accuracy rate in the detection of skin cancer.\n\nSkinScreener is a user-friendly app, developed and clinically proven by a team of dermatologists, physicians, and biomedical engineers. SkinScreener enables a quick assessment of the risk of skin cancer in the case of skin lesions (moles, skin spots, birthmarks).\n\nFor this purpose, a photo of the designated skin area is taken with the camera of the smartphone. The image is then run through our clinically proven neural network. The risk status for skin cancer is indicated by an easy to understand 3 color code (low, medium, high risk).\n\nSkinScreener is available as a free download, and users will receive a limited number of free scans after registration. Additional scans are offered as a paid subscription for a period of 1 or 12 months, or as a paid number of scans.\n\nBefore the scan, users must perform a camera test to ensure a working camera and good photo quality. The scan is performed according to the instructions for use. The algorithm calculates the risk assessment for skin cancer at the designated skin area:\nGreen: LOW RISK\nYellow: MEDIUM RISK or \nRed: HIGH RISK\n\nBased on the risk assessment, users are advised to consult a dermatologist for further examination to obtain an accurate medical diagnosis. Users with a \"MEDIUM RISK\" or \"HIGH RISK\" rating should see the dermatologist earlier than the recommended preventive dermatological examinations. The specialist will then verify the results by further specialist examinations.\n\nIn the LOW RISK assessment, the skin lesion should be monitored regularly and rescanned at least once a month.\n\nNevertheless, SkinScreener users should visit their dermatologist for a regular annual dermatological examination.\n\nSkinScreener is registered as a Class I medical device (European Directive 93/42/EEC) and clinically validated by a study at the Medical University of Graz.\n\nSkinScreener is intended for adult users with Fitzpatrick skin type I (ivory) to IV (light brown). SkinScreener must not be used on children.\n\nWe take the protection of your data seriously! Your data will exclusively be stored on European servers and according to the EU Data Protection Directive (GDPR). Your pictures will only be stored anonymously on our servers and will be used to improve our app and for research purposes.\n\nDisclaimer: This app does not replace a physical examination by a doctor. Always seek professional medical advice, especially before making medical decisions. SkinScreener cannot replace a dermatological examination, it does not make a diagnosis and cannot replace the visit of a medical professional.\n\nIndication: To evaluate a lesion on human skin for possible visual signs of skin cancer using a three-level classification (LOW RISK, MEDIUM RISK, or HIGH RISK).\n\nGeneral terms and conditions: https://skinscreener.at/en/terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy policy: https://skinscreener.at/en/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "With MeTime you simply choose the area you want to treat or improve, select your preferences, treatments that may interest you, or simply leave it up to the Providers to make suggestions and recommendations.  You can take photos, select the locations and range for Providers, and what you’re willing to spend.  Once you submit your preferences and photos, Providers in your selected area will contact you through the app to give their expert recommendations and start a chat.  \n\nAREAS\n\nEach Journey in MeTime begins with your selection of areas.  These include face, neck, body, skin, hair, teeth, and intimate.  Within each area you can select specifically what region you want to improve, correct or enhance.  For example, within the face area you can choose eyes, nose, cheeks, face shape, and many more.  Within body you can choose tummy, thighs, breasts, hands, feet, for example.  You can also select skin, hair restoration or removal, teeth restoration, and treatments for intimate areas for women and men.  \n\nPREFERENCES\n\nYou can skip to get recommendations and suggestions from Providers if you prefer and simply upload some photos.  If you know what you want, you can select preferences for each area, such as tightening skin, improving face shape, removing fat, and enhancing lips or features.  Then, you can click on treatments that you are considering such as liposuction, face lifting, fillers, nose surgery, lasers and so on.  You will guide the Providers by selecting how dramatic a change, or subtle, you want your treatment to be, and whether you want something nonsurgical, minimally invasive, or surgical.  \n\nPHOTOS\n\nWith MeTime you have the opportunity to submit photos safely and securely so that Providers can give tailored treatment recommendations without the need to meet you physically.  The MeTime photo upload section guides you through taking photos of appropriate areas at different angles so your Provider can give you the best advice.  You can submit one or more photos, or skip, although photos greatly enhance the ability for Providers to provide accurate advice during the chat.\n\nMATCHING\n\nAs a MeTime user, you can select your current location or a different city to match with Providers, and a range within that location to match with more or fewer Providers!  You can also limit your matching to certain specialties and those with a certain amount of experience.  Adding price range and downtime using the app filters helps Providers give you a more tailored treatment plan.  You’ll then be matched instantly, and you’ll have the chance to remove certain Providers from the match if you choose before your information and photos are submitted.  \n\nCHAT\n\nOnce you submit your MeTime Journey, just sit back and relax and wait for Providers to send you messages to your MeTime inbox!  You can review their recommendations and start a chat with Providers to get more information, send more photos, receive pricing and offers, and make bookings.  You’ll be able to see the profiles of Providers who chat with you to learn more about their expertise and practice.  \n\nCONNECTED AND SAFE\n\nIt’s never been easier to connect with aesthetic providers, get advice and recommendations about what’s right for you, and learn about treatments and updates in aesthetics, health and wellness. You can learn about treatments and stay up to date with exciting blogs, find out what’s best for you, chat with Providers, and send photos safely and securely.  All using MeTime, the app for you!"

You might want to know if their glucose levels go too high or too low, be able to quickly and easily access their insulin pump and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system information. \r\n \r\nWith the CareLink™ Connect app, now you can remotely see their glucose levels and insulin pump information wherever you are, so you can know how they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app helps you quickly accomplish these tasks: \r\nLet you securely view glucose levels, graphs, and trends\r\nSends you high or low glucose levels notifications, so you can be informed and supportive\r\nShows you the status of the insulin pump system, for greater peace of mind\r\n\r\nTo remotely view pump system information, family members or friends need to install the CareLink™ Connect app on their compatible mobile device. Also, the person with diabetes needs a MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump, the MiniMed™ Mobile app installed on a compatible mobile device, which then should be connected online to the CareLink™ software. To find a list of compatible devices, please visit your local Medtronic website. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: In order to receive real-time updates, the app needs to continuously receive data from the CareLink™ servers, and the insulin pump system needs to sync with the CareLink™ servers through the MiniMed™ Mobile app. The CareLink™ Connect app only works with the MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump systems; it currently does not support other standalone CGM systems, MiniMed™ or Paradigm™ insulin pumps. \r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app is intended to provide a secondary display of insulin pump and CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) system data on a supported mobile device. CareLink™ Connect app is not intended to replace the real-time display of insulin pump or CGM data on the primary display device. All therapy decisions should be based on the primary display device.\r\n\r\nCareLink™ Connect app is not intended to analyze or modify the insulin pump and CGM data that it receives.

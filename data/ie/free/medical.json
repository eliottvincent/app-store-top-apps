      "label": "The COVID Tracker App can help reduce the spread of coronavirus in Ireland and help everyone stay safe.\n\nIt's easy:\n\n- download the app\n- choose what information you want to share, or not\n- that's it, you are now part of the contact tracing community, helping to keep everyone safe from coronavirus.\n\nIf you use the app you will:\n\n-be alerted if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus\n-be able to track your symptoms and get advice on what to do\n-have the choice to anonymously warn others if you test positive for coronavirus - this will help keep other people safe\n-protect yourself and others as everyone begins to return to normal life\n\nHow the COVID Tracker app works\nThe app has 3 functions:\n\ncontact tracing\nCOVID check-in\nupdates and information\n\n1. Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

      "label": "The incidence of skin cancer has increased steadily worldwide in recent years. Statistically, the probability of developing skin cancer once in a lifetime is about 20%. Early detection is of extreme importance. The earlier skin cancer can be detected, the better the chances of recovery. This is why our group of dermatologists and biomedical engineers have developed SkinScreener, a smart way to determine the personal risk of altered skin areas with an app, in addition to regular dermatological examinations. \n\nA clinical study at the Medical University of Graz (using more than 1500 images of real patients) has proven that SkinScreener has an impressive 95% accuracy rate in the detection of skin cancer.\n\nSkinScreener is a user-friendly app, developed and clinically proven by a team of dermatologists, physicians, and biomedical engineers. SkinScreener enables a quick assessment of the risk of skin cancer in the case of skin lesions (moles, skin spots, birthmarks).\n\nFor this purpose, a photo of the designated skin area is taken with the camera of the smartphone. The image is then run through our clinically proven neural network. The risk status for skin cancer is indicated by an easy to understand 3 color code (low, medium, high risk).\n\nSkinScreener is available as a free download, and users will receive a limited number of free scans after registration. Additional scans are offered as a paid subscription for a period of 1 or 12 months, or as a paid number of scans.\n\nBefore the scan, users must perform a camera test to ensure a working camera and good photo quality. The scan is performed according to the instructions for use. The algorithm calculates the risk assessment for skin cancer at the designated skin area:\nGreen: LOW RISK\nYellow: MEDIUM RISK or \nRed: HIGH RISK\n\nBased on the risk assessment, users are advised to consult a dermatologist for further examination to obtain an accurate medical diagnosis. Users with a \"MEDIUM RISK\" or \"HIGH RISK\" rating should see the dermatologist earlier than the recommended preventive dermatological examinations. The specialist will then verify the results by further specialist examinations.\n\nIn the LOW RISK assessment, the skin lesion should be monitored regularly and rescanned at least once a month.\n\nNevertheless, SkinScreener users should visit their dermatologist for a regular annual dermatological examination.\n\nSkinScreener is registered as a Class I medical device (European Directive 93/42/EEC) and clinically validated by a study at the Medical University of Graz.\n\nSkinScreener is intended for adult users with Fitzpatrick skin type I (ivory) to IV (light brown). SkinScreener must not be used on children.\n\nWe take the protection of your data seriously! Your data will exclusively be stored on European servers and according to the EU Data Protection Directive (GDPR). Your pictures will only be stored anonymously on our servers and will be used to improve our app and for research purposes.\n\nDisclaimer: This app does not replace a physical examination by a doctor. Always seek professional medical advice, especially before making medical decisions. SkinScreener cannot replace a dermatological examination, it does not make a diagnosis and cannot replace the visit of a medical professional.\n\nIndication: To evaluate a lesion on human skin for possible visual signs of skin cancer using a three-level classification (LOW RISK, MEDIUM RISK, or HIGH RISK).\n\nGeneral terms and conditions: https://skinscreener.at/en/terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy policy: https://skinscreener.at/en/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "With MeTime you simply choose the area you want to treat or improve, select your preferences, treatments that may interest you, or simply leave it up to the Providers to make suggestions and recommendations.  You can take photos, select the locations and range for Providers, and what you’re willing to spend.  Once you submit your preferences and photos, Providers in your selected area will contact you through the app to give their expert recommendations and start a chat.  \n\nAREAS\n\nEach Journey in MeTime begins with your selection of areas.  These include face, neck, body, skin, hair, teeth, and intimate.  Within each area you can select specifically what region you want to improve, correct or enhance.  For example, within the face area you can choose eyes, nose, cheeks, face shape, and many more.  Within body you can choose tummy, thighs, breasts, hands, feet, for example.  You can also select skin, hair restoration or removal, teeth restoration, and treatments for intimate areas for women and men.  \n\nPREFERENCES\n\nYou can skip to get recommendations and suggestions from Providers if you prefer and simply upload some photos.  If you know what you want, you can select preferences for each area, such as tightening skin, improving face shape, removing fat, and enhancing lips or features.  Then, you can click on treatments that you are considering such as liposuction, face lifting, fillers, nose surgery, lasers and so on.  You will guide the Providers by selecting how dramatic a change, or subtle, you want your treatment to be, and whether you want something nonsurgical, minimally invasive, or surgical.  \n\nPHOTOS\n\nWith MeTime you have the opportunity to submit photos safely and securely so that Providers can give tailored treatment recommendations without the need to meet you physically.  The MeTime photo upload section guides you through taking photos of appropriate areas at different angles so your Provider can give you the best advice.  You can submit one or more photos, or skip, although photos greatly enhance the ability for Providers to provide accurate advice during the chat.\n\nMATCHING\n\nAs a MeTime user, you can select your current location or a different city to match with Providers, and a range within that location to match with more or fewer Providers!  You can also limit your matching to certain specialties and those with a certain amount of experience.  Adding price range and downtime using the app filters helps Providers give you a more tailored treatment plan.  You’ll then be matched instantly, and you’ll have the chance to remove certain Providers from the match if you choose before your information and photos are submitted.  \n\nCHAT\n\nOnce you submit your MeTime Journey, just sit back and relax and wait for Providers to send you messages to your MeTime inbox!  You can review their recommendations and start a chat with Providers to get more information, send more photos, receive pricing and offers, and make bookings.  You’ll be able to see the profiles of Providers who chat with you to learn more about their expertise and practice.  \n\nCONNECTED AND SAFE\n\nIt’s never been easier to connect with aesthetic providers, get advice and recommendations about what’s right for you, and learn about treatments and updates in aesthetics, health and wellness. You can learn about treatments and stay up to date with exciting blogs, find out what’s best for you, chat with Providers, and send photos safely and securely.  All using MeTime, the app for you!"

Low FODMAP Lifestyle is the easiest way to look up which foods are high FODMAP and low FODMAP.\n\nThis app is build by Lifeplano and we know what IBS and the low FODMAP diet is about, because one of our founders have followed it himself. It is a very restrictive diet and therefore harder to follow, but we have made it so much easier with Low FODMAP Lifestyle.\n\n*Functionalities*\n- Low FODMAP food list\n- Personal testing of every food\n- More than 40+ recipes\n- Basic knowledge about IBS and FODMAPs\n\n*What is IBS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome?*\nIBS is a condition where your gut have trouble digesting foods with certain carbohydrates: Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Mannitols and Polyols. Which carbohydrates you react too can be different from others, as the amount also can, which is why it is a very personal diet.\n\nIt is estimated by scientists at the Australian Monash University that 1 in 7 suffers from IBS and it is a lifestyle condition mainly present in western countries.\n\n*What is the Low FODMAP Diet?*\nMonash University are also the inventors of the Low FODMAP Diet. It is a diet that helps you find out exactly what carbohydrates and foods your gut reacts to and in what amount, so you can limit or exclude that from your diet going forward.\n\nThe IBS diet consist of three phases:\n- Phase 1: The eliminations phase - Here you eliminate FODMAPs from your diet until you are symptom free.\n- Phase 2: The reintroduction phase - Here you slowly reintroduce the different carbohydrates, and test which ones cause reactions.\n- Phase 3: The personal diet phase - You now have a personal diet, but IBS can develop over time, so you need to retest foods again to see if your tolerance changed.\n\nWith our app you can also test new foods and drinks that haven't been tested yet and see if you tolerate it. Examples could be a can of Pepsi or ketchup which are both processed groceries with unknown levels of FODMAPs.\n\nThe diet can seem very restrictive if you are new to it, and it is proved that restrictive diets are the hardest to follow. With Low FODMAP Lifestyle we have made the diet more available so it seems easier to follow and less restrictive. Follow our low FODMAP recipes, get symptom free and test new foods every week, to make your personal diet and low FODMAP food list.\n\n______________________________\nTerms of use: https://bornly.com/terms-of-service/\n\nMedical disclaimer\nWE ARE NOT DOCTORS AND DO NOT GIVE MEDICAL ADVICE.

There are also easy-to-read graphs which help to see important trends of baby’s development. We’ve created a tool that benefits mom, baby and dad (yes, he can track child’s activity too!), making those first months of parenting a stress-free experience.

      "label": "\"With God all things are possible\"\n(and that includes an amazing birth!)\n- Matthew 19:26\n\nUsing Christian Hypnobirthing, thousands of women around the world have experienced easier, more relaxed births - some even completely pain-free without any medicated pain relief! This is because the scripture-based audio tracks help condition your mind and body to trust in God, and come into a relaxed, faith-filled state. Being in this state helps the body produce oxytocin (the hormone responsible for an efficient labour) and endorphins (your body's natural pain relief). \n\nThe relaxation techniques used in Christian Hypnobirthing can be applied no matter what kind of birth you're having, whether that's an unmedicated physiological birth, a cesarean, or anything in between... If you believe that God is with you throughout your pregnancy, and that birth is a positive and wonderful opportunity to connect with Him and your baby, then that will have a massive impact on your birth experience. \n\nCHRISTIAN HYPNOBIRTHING CAN:\n\n- help you feel more connected to God and your baby during pregnancy and birth\n- increase comfort naturally during birth\n- decrease stress and fear\n- provide comfort and relaxation throughout pregnancy\n\nCAN HYPNOBIRTHING BE CHRISTIAN?\n\nYes!\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions around what hypnobirthing is (some people worry that it’s a form of mind control or ‘not right with God’ etc - which could not be further from the truth).\n\nSimply put, hypnobirthing brings you into a deeply relaxed state, where you’re able to absorb positive affirmations and beliefs about birth while remaining alert and completely in control. In fact, as a Christian, you’ve probably already experienced being in this relaxed state many times, during prayer or worship activities, etc.\n\nListening to Christian Hypnobirthing helps to bring you into this calm, faith-filled state, which can help make birth a more relaxing and joyful experience.\n\nTHE APP FEATURES:\n\nOver an hour of audio tracks including:\n- Breathing and Visualisation exercises\n- Encouraging Scriptures for birth\n- Positive Affirmations\n- Prayers for strength\n- Postpartum encouragement\n\nA ‘Positive Birth’ section with links to birth videos, and more.\n\nBlog and Birth Stories\n\nA 50% discount code for our Printable Birth Affirmation Cards.\n\nDownload Christian Hypnobirthing and benefit from both the relaxing and calming effects of hypnobirthing, combined with the huge strength, love and support that come from our Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, and Holy Spirit.\n\nPlease note Christian Hypnobirthing is designed to help support you in a more comfortable birth, but it is in no way a substitute for the advice or presence of a qualified obstetrician, midwife or other medical caregiver. Please always consult your doctor before making any changes to your pregnancy, birth or lifestyle choices.\n\nwww.christianhypnobirthing.com\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/JAXVq4Ry\nPrivacy policy: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/2wZXCrdl"

With regular monitoring, it can be detected and treated early. When left untreated, atrial fibrillation can expose to e.g. stroke and heart failure. We recommend that you perform CardioSignal measurement twice daily. If CardioSignal detects signs of atrial fibrillation in two consecutive measurements, you need a heart health assessment by a health care professional.\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\n\r\nThe app is easy to use: Lie down and relax. In the app, press the start button and place your phone in the center of your chest. The measurement takes 60 seconds, after which you will get the result in seconds.\r\n\r\nOur technology is patented and clinically proven to detect signs of atrial fibrillation with 96% accuracy. CardioSignal uses motion sensors on the phone and our proprietary algorithm to detect signs of atrial fibrillation, analyzing measured data to determine whether there is atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the atrial fibrillation measurement requires a 1 month, 3 month or 1 year subscription. Creating a user ID is required. For more information, please visit www.cardiosignal.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION: THE CARDIOSIGNAL APPLICATION IS DESIGNED TO DETECT POSSIBLE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. IT IS NOT DESIGNED FOR DETECTING OTHER DISEASES. IN CASE OF A HEALTH EMERGENCY, CONTACT YOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER.\r\n\r\nTHE APPLICATION IS INTENDED FOR ADULT POPULATION. A PERSON WITH A PACEMAKER SHOULD NOT USE THE APPLICATION."

The App is available in 18 languages and maps over 250.000 defibrillators worldwide.\n\nStaying Alive is an award winning free App designed and developed by AEDMAP.\n\nMain features include:\n\n- AED location : locate the 10 closest AEDs near you or in a specific address, through the use of a live database that is updated each time you launch the application.\n\n- Reporting of new AED.\nYou can post new defibrillators and now even edit existing ones.\n\n- Citizen Responders network: If you are trained to CPR you can register through the App as a Citizen Responder. You can then be notified by the EMS in case of cardiac arrest near you to provide CPR. Staying Alive First Responder technology works in France, Belgium and Switzerland so far.\n\n- The reminding of CPR gesture with video illustration of the survival chain \"Call, Start CPR, Shock and wait for help\"\n\n- A practical guide on the use of Automatic External Defibrillator (AED).\n\n- An \"Emergency\" mode that will help you to make the right things in the right order. The new emergency mode detects automatically the local number depending on you location.\n\n---\n \nThe location and the list of defibrillators supplied by this application are given as an indication. Please note that this application is interactive and that the data provided by users will not be checked by a dedicated organization. AEDMAP is not liable for any errors in the locations of defibrillators.\n\n*****************************************************************\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n*****************************************************************\n\nDeveloped by AEDMAP - www.aedmap.org"

      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

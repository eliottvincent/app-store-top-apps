      "label": "The COVID Tracker App can help reduce the spread of coronavirus in Ireland and help everyone stay safe.\n\nIt's easy:\n\n- download the app\n- choose what information you want to share, or not\n- that's it, you are now part of the contact tracing community, helping to keep everyone safe from coronavirus.\n\nIf you use the app you will:\n\n-be alerted if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus\n-be able to track your symptoms and get advice on what to do\n-have the choice to anonymously warn others if you test positive for coronavirus - this will help keep other people safe\n-protect yourself and others as everyone begins to return to normal life\n\nHow the COVID Tracker app works\nThe app has 3 functions:\n\ncontact tracing\nCOVID check-in\nupdates and information\n\n1. Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

We may need a rash identifier, a mole checker, a skin analyzer, or an acne scanner, depending on the problem. The AI-Dermatologist app combines all these functions. We have designed this modern skin analyzer so that by using it on a regular basis, if you suspect a problem, you can contact your healthcare providers in time and avoid complications.\n\nBased on today's most advanced Artificial intelligence technologies and professional knowledge and expertise in dermatology, our application enables you to check all your skin problems for risk assessment: spots, birthmarks, acne, moles or papillomas. In 1 minute AI-Dermatologist gives a result on the next step to be taken. Likewise, AI-Dermatologist gives you the opportunity to store photos to keep track of changes over time and monitor your skin health in the long run. By creating AI-Dermatologist, we supported the idea of making skin screening and monitoring accessible to everyone.\n\nWith AI-Dermatologist you can:\n- Snapshot your skin spots, birth-marks, mole or another skin diseases such as: angioma, warts, papillomas, mollusks and etc.\n- Take / upload photos and track results for changes\n- Get a reminder when it is time to take a new photo, take pills or build a skin care routine \n- Сreate your own scheme for the medicines or cosmetics’ use according to your schedule \n- Track dynamics of baseline and follow-up results\n- Easily log the tracked your skin conditions locations on your body\n\nPlease note that AI-Dermatologist is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace or cancel a visit to your doctor. This application aims to help you be more aware of your skin condition via self-exams, but it is not an online dermatology platform. If you ever feel uncomfortable or see that your skin spot is changing, irritated, itchy or bleeding, we strongly recommend that you contact a medical specialist without hesitation to avoid the risk of melanoma or other skin diseases.\n\nBy signing up for this subscription, you agree to our\nTerms of use http://ai-derm.com/terms/terms_of_use.html\nPrivacy Policy http://ai-derm.com/privacy/privacy.html"

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

      "label": "The incidence of skin cancer has increased steadily worldwide in recent years. Statistically, the probability of developing skin cancer once in a lifetime is about 20%. Early detection is of extreme importance. The earlier skin cancer can be detected, the better the chances of recovery. This is why our group of dermatologists and biomedical engineers have developed SkinScreener, a smart way to determine the personal risk of altered skin areas with an app, in addition to regular dermatological examinations. \n\nA clinical study at the Medical University of Graz (using more than 1500 images of real patients) has proven that SkinScreener has an impressive 95% accuracy rate in the detection of skin cancer.\n\nSkinScreener is a user-friendly app, developed and clinically proven by a team of dermatologists, physicians, and biomedical engineers. SkinScreener enables a quick assessment of the risk of skin cancer in the case of skin lesions (moles, skin spots, birthmarks).\n\nFor this purpose, a photo of the designated skin area is taken with the camera of the smartphone. The image is then run through our clinically proven neural network. The risk status for skin cancer is indicated by an easy to understand 3 color code (low, medium, high risk).\n\nSkinScreener is available as a free download, and users will receive a limited number of free scans after registration. Additional scans are offered as a paid subscription for a period of 1 or 12 months, or as a paid number of scans.\n\nBefore the scan, users must perform a camera test to ensure a working camera and good photo quality. The scan is performed according to the instructions for use. The algorithm calculates the risk assessment for skin cancer at the designated skin area:\nGreen: LOW RISK\nYellow: MEDIUM RISK or \nRed: HIGH RISK\n\nBased on the risk assessment, users are advised to consult a dermatologist for further examination to obtain an accurate medical diagnosis. Users with a \"MEDIUM RISK\" or \"HIGH RISK\" rating should see the dermatologist earlier than the recommended preventive dermatological examinations. The specialist will then verify the results by further specialist examinations.\n\nIn the LOW RISK assessment, the skin lesion should be monitored regularly and rescanned at least once a month.\n\nNevertheless, SkinScreener users should visit their dermatologist for a regular annual dermatological examination.\n\nSkinScreener is registered as a Class I medical device (European Directive 93/42/EEC) and clinically validated by a study at the Medical University of Graz.\n\nSkinScreener is intended for adult users with Fitzpatrick skin type I (ivory) to IV (light brown). SkinScreener must not be used on children.\n\nWe take the protection of your data seriously! Your data will exclusively be stored on European servers and according to the EU Data Protection Directive (GDPR). Your pictures will only be stored anonymously on our servers and will be used to improve our app and for research purposes.\n\nDisclaimer: This app does not replace a physical examination by a doctor. Always seek professional medical advice, especially before making medical decisions. SkinScreener cannot replace a dermatological examination, it does not make a diagnosis and cannot replace the visit of a medical professional.\n\nIndication: To evaluate a lesion on human skin for possible visual signs of skin cancer using a three-level classification (LOW RISK, MEDIUM RISK, or HIGH RISK).\n\nGeneral terms and conditions: https://skinscreener.at/en/terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy policy: https://skinscreener.at/en/privacy-policy/"

You will be charged to your iTunes account and will automatically renew within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, unless auto-renewal is disabled beforehand. The subscription is then automatically renewed each year unless auto-renewal is disabled.

Or to gain confidence before performing a procedure you perform less commonly?\n \nThe Dechra Dog & Cat Anaesthesia app is a unique resource designed to put practical, accessible information into the hands of veterinarians, veterinary nurses/technicians and vet students. Developed with specialist veterinary anaesthetists and approved by the Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists (AVA), the app contains suggested anaesthetic protocols for 24 procedures in the dog and 15 in the cat. It is like having a veterinary anaesthetist in your pocket!\n \nEach procedure contains up to date, detailed anaesthetic considerations for the patient including pre-op stabilisation where required, appropriate premedication options, peri-operative analgesia and details about induction, maintenance, monitoring, and recovery. This allows you to choose the most appropriate protocol for every unique patient.\nThe app also contains information about 36 of the most commonly used molecules in dog and cat anaesthesia, allowing you to confidently choose and use the most appropriate molecule for every situation. A suggested dosage and route of administration is given, alongside information about indication, time to onset and duration of action, contraindications and side effects.\nThe app includes an easy to use dose calculator so that you can quickly calculate the doses required for your patient and also allows you to design your own protocols. Each completed protocol can be saved into your favourites folder to use again, or you can email the protocol summary to be saved in the patient’s clinical records, or to be printed.\n\nDechra are advocates of patient safety and are keen to promote best practice anaesthesia. As part of this commitment we have included the AVA Anaesthetic Safety Checklist within the app. The Dechra Dog and Cat Anaesthesia App reinforces Dechra as leaders in veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia and provides unprecedented technical support to veterinary professionals."

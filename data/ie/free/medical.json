Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

We have put a lot of work into designing a navigation system that is easy to use so you will have no problem finding the information you need.  The app currently contains four sections:\n\nDrug dosages\nGuidelines & Protocols\nGeneral Information\nParenteral nutrition\n\n\nPlease note that, like the formulary itself, the app will constantly change and update.  Over the course of each version we will be adding to and editing the drug information and guidelines.  All updates will be automatically added to your app when you open it.  \n\n\nA Subscription is required to use Formulary. You will be charged to your iTunes account and will automatically renew within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, unless auto-renewal is disabled beforehand. The subscription is then automatically renewed each year unless auto-renewal is disabled. To manage your subscriptions or to disable auto-renewal, after purchase, go to your iTunes account settings.\n\nSubscription is priced at €5.99 per year:\n\nThe Formulary privacy policy which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_privacy_policy.html\nThe Formulary Terms of Use which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_terms.html\n\nThis app is intended for Healthcare professionals only and as such, before allowing access to the critical information in the Drugs Dosages section, OLCHC requires each user to register to create a record of users that can help verify that any individual user is a medical professional if needed. Data gathered will be used for no other purpose other than the management of this app."

You can take photos, select the locations and range for Providers, and what you’re willing to spend.  Once you submit your preferences and photos, Providers in your selected area will contact you through the app to give their expert recommendations and start a chat.  \n\nAREAS\n\nEach Journey in MeTime begins with your selection of areas.  These include face, neck, body, skin, hair, teeth, and intimate.  Within each area you can select specifically what region you want to improve, correct or enhance.  For example, within the face area you can choose eyes, nose, cheeks, face shape, and many more.  Within body you can choose tummy, thighs, breasts, hands, feet, for example.  You can also select skin, hair restoration or removal, teeth restoration, and treatments for intimate areas for women and men.  \n\nPREFERENCES\n\nYou can skip to get recommendations and suggestions from Providers if you prefer and simply upload some photos.  If you know what you want, you can select preferences for each area, such as tightening skin, improving face shape, removing fat, and enhancing lips or features.  Then, you can click on treatments that you are considering such as liposuction, face lifting, fillers, nose surgery, lasers and so on.  You will guide the Providers by selecting how dramatic a change, or subtle, you want your treatment to be, and whether you want something nonsurgical, minimally invasive, or surgical.  \n\nPHOTOS\n\nWith MeTime you have the opportunity to submit photos safely and securely so that Providers can give tailored treatment recommendations without the need to meet you physically.  The MeTime photo upload section guides you through taking photos of appropriate areas at different angles so your Provider can give you the best advice.  You can submit one or more photos, or skip, although photos greatly enhance the ability for Providers to provide accurate advice during the chat.\n\nMATCHING\n\nAs a MeTime user, you can select your current location or a different city to match with Providers, and a range within that location to match with more or fewer Providers!  You can also limit your matching to certain specialties and those with a certain amount of experience.  Adding price range and downtime using the app filters helps Providers give you a more tailored treatment plan.  You’ll then be matched instantly, and you’ll have the chance to remove certain Providers from the match if you choose before your information and photos are submitted.  \n\nCHAT\n\nOnce you submit your MeTime Journey, just sit back and relax and wait for Providers to send you messages to your MeTime inbox!  You can review their recommendations and start a chat with Providers to get more information, send more photos, receive pricing and offers, and make bookings.  You’ll be able to see the profiles of Providers who chat with you to learn more about their expertise and practice.  \n\nCONNECTED AND SAFE\n\nIt’s never been easier to connect with aesthetic providers, get advice and recommendations about what’s right for you, and learn about treatments and updates in aesthetics, health and wellness. You can learn about treatments and stay up to date with exciting blogs, find out what’s best for you, chat with Providers, and send photos safely and securely.  All using MeTime, the app for you!"

We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

Bond with your baby instead of trying to remember which breast side to feed from, when your little one pooped or how long it has been since the last nap.\r\n\r\nWe talked with new moms to understand their needs and wishes; that’s how we came up with the SuperMama app. It keeps all newborn’s data readily at hand and lets you be more organized. Besides standard events, you can log info about medicines, baths, allergies and make custom notes. SuperMama app can be a game changer for new parents. It helps you plan your day and gives you more time for yourself, if you’re a mompreneur, for example.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can track with SuperMama:\r\n* Breastfeeding:  log nursing time, set reminders and remember which side you last breastfed on (this is important to avoid plugged milk and mastitis);\r\n* Breast pumping:  track the volume to be sure that there is enough milk pumped;\r\n* Diaper changes:  take care of your baby’s delicate skin and keep track of his/her bowel movements;\r\n* Bottle feeding:  log the volume of formula, pumped milk, water or juice;\r\n* Sleep:  track duration, notice patterns and evaluate the quality of your little angel’s sleeps;\r\n* Growth:  record baby’s weight, height and head circumference, update these numbers whenever you want and watch the progress with growth charts;\r\n* Custom events:  choose from existing (meds, tummy time, complementary foods) or create your own. \r\n\r\nAll data is presented in a slick and easily accessible way. There are also easy-to-read graphs which help to see important trends of baby’s development. We’ve created a tool that benefits mom, baby and dad (yes, he can track child’s activity too!), making those first months of parenting a stress-free experience. Have everything under control with SuperMama!\r\n \r\nShare your views and comments via support@supermama.io and we’ll tweak the app just for you! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nTerms of Service: https://supermama.io/terms\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://supermama.io/privacy"

Dexcom G6 is approved for children age 2 and older.\n\nThe Dexcom G6 System provides personalized trend alerts right on your smart device and lets you see when your glucose levels are going too low, or too high, so you can better manage your diabetes. The Alert Schedule feature lets you schedule and customize a second set of alerts.  Custom alert sounds are available, including a Vibrate-Only option on the phone for glucose alerts. The only exception is the Urgent Low Alarm, which you can’t turn off.\n\n\nThe Always Sound setting allows you to receive certain Dexcom CGM Alerts even if your phone sound is off, set to vibrate, or in Do Not Disturb mode. This will allow you to silence calls or texts but still receive audible CGM Urgent Low Alarm and alerts: Low and High Glucose alert, Urgent Low Soon, and Rise and Fall Rate.  Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default. A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.  For safety, the Urgent Low alarm and these alerts can’t be silenced: Transmitter Failed, Sensor Failed, and App Stopped. \n\nIn addition to the accurate performance provided by the Dexcom Sensor, you’ll receive other valuable features:\n\n•\tShare your glucose data with your followers who can monitor your glucose data and trends on their compatible smart device with the Dexcom Follow app. Share and Follow functions require an internet connection\n•\tHealth app access so you can share retrospective glucose data with third party apps\n•\tToday View widget, which allows you to view your glucose data on the lock screen of your smart device\n•\tAsk Siri* to read your current glucose value, using a custom phrase\n•\tA Dexcom CLARITY link on the landscape trend graph lets you easily transition to the CLARITY App to view more information on your glucose trends\n\n*Siri may not be available in all regions.

      "label": "The incidence of skin cancer has increased steadily worldwide in recent years. Statistically, the probability of developing skin cancer once in a lifetime is about 20%. Early detection is of extreme importance. The earlier skin cancer can be detected, the better the chances of recovery. This is why our group of dermatologists and biomedical engineers have developed SkinScreener, a smart way to determine the personal risk of altered skin areas with an app, in addition to regular dermatological examinations. \n\nA clinical study at the Medical University of Graz (using more than 1500 images of real patients) has proven that SkinScreener has an impressive 95% accuracy rate in the detection of skin cancer.\n\nSkinScreener is a user-friendly app, developed and clinically proven by a team of dermatologists, physicians, and biomedical engineers. SkinScreener enables a quick assessment of the risk of skin cancer in the case of skin lesions (moles, skin spots, birthmarks).\n\nFor this purpose, a photo of the designated skin area is taken with the camera of the smartphone. The image is then run through our clinically proven neural network. The risk status for skin cancer is indicated by an easy to understand 3 color code (low, medium, high risk).\n\nSkinScreener is available as a free download, and users will receive a limited number of free scans after registration. Additional scans are offered as a paid subscription for a period of 1 or 12 months, or as a paid number of scans.\n\nBefore the scan, users must perform a camera test to ensure a working camera and good photo quality. The scan is performed according to the instructions for use. The algorithm calculates the risk assessment for skin cancer at the designated skin area:\nGreen: LOW RISK\nYellow: MEDIUM RISK or \nRed: HIGH RISK\n\nBased on the risk assessment, users are advised to consult a dermatologist for further examination to obtain an accurate medical diagnosis. Users with a \"MEDIUM RISK\" or \"HIGH RISK\" rating should see the dermatologist earlier than the recommended preventive dermatological examinations. The specialist will then verify the results by further specialist examinations.\n\nIn the LOW RISK assessment, the skin lesion should be monitored regularly and rescanned at least once a month.\n\nNevertheless, SkinScreener users should visit their dermatologist for a regular annual dermatological examination.\n\nSkinScreener is registered as a Class I medical device (European Directive 93/42/EEC) and clinically validated by a study at the Medical University of Graz.\n\nSkinScreener is intended for adult users with Fitzpatrick skin type I (ivory) to IV (light brown). SkinScreener must not be used on children.\n\nWe take the protection of your data seriously! Your data will exclusively be stored on European servers and according to the EU Data Protection Directive (GDPR). Your pictures will only be stored anonymously on our servers and will be used to improve our app and for research purposes.\n\nDisclaimer: This app does not replace a physical examination by a doctor. Always seek professional medical advice, especially before making medical decisions. SkinScreener cannot replace a dermatological examination, it does not make a diagnosis and cannot replace the visit of a medical professional.\n\nIndication: To evaluate a lesion on human skin for possible visual signs of skin cancer using a three-level classification (LOW RISK, MEDIUM RISK, or HIGH RISK).\n\nGeneral terms and conditions: https://skinscreener.at/en/terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy policy: https://skinscreener.at/en/privacy-policy/"

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more!

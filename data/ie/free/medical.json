Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

Diante disso, o Conecte SUS, a partir da implementação da Rede Nacional de Dados em Saúde (RNDS), foi redirecionado para receber e compartilhar informações que auxiliem no controle da situação de emergência da saúde pública, com destaque ao processo de vacinação Covid-19 no Brasil.\nFuncionalidades:\nAcesse os resultados de exames realizados por qualquer laboratório no território nacional integrado à RNDS para a detecção da Covid-19;\nVeja seu histórico de vacinação na Carteira de Vacinação Digital;\n*No momento, o Conecte SUS apenas apresenta os dados relacionados à vacinação contra a Covid-19, especificando a data da aplicação, o nome da vacina, o lote, o estabelecimento de saúde e o código do vacinador. Gradativamente serão disponibilizadas as demais vacinas ministradas pelo SUS.\nEmita o Certificado Nacional de Vacinação Covid-19 na palma da mão. \nApós as duas doses da vacina (ou a dose única) serem registradas pelos estados ou municípios na RNDS¹, é possível emitir o certificado em pdf nos idiomas português, inglês e espanhol. Esse documento é válido em todo território nacional e pode ser autenticado gratuitamente, utilizando o leitor ValidaQRCode no próprio aplicativo ou digitando o código do documento em:\n https://validacertidao.saude.gov.br/;\n*No certificado é especificado os dados cadastrais da pessoa vacinada (nome, data de nascimento, sexo, CPF), data e horário de emissão, além de informações sobre as doses administradas, como a data de aplicação, nome da vacina, lote e estabelecimento de saúde. \nAcesse o histórico de internação hospitalar no SUS;\n*Dados a partir de abril de 2018.\n·      Veja os medicamentos dispensados pela Farmácia Popular;\nLocalize rapidamente os estabelecimentos mais próximos como os serviços de Saúde Bucal e Doenças Raras;\nConsulte dicas nutricionais e de atividades físicas e verifique o Índice de Massa Corporal (IMC) na funcionalidade “Peso Saudável”;\n \nQuer saber mais?\nAcesso o Conecte SUS na web em: https://conectesus-paciente.saude.gov.br/\nAcesse os portais:\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/conecte-sus\nhttps://www.gov.br/pt-br/servicos/certificado-nacional-de-vacinacao-covid-19\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/saude-digital\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/rnds\n¹ Os registros são de responsabilidade dos gestores estaduais e municipais de saúde, que fazem a coleta e envio das informações para a base de dados do Ministério da Saúde. Eles são feitos pelas equipes responsáveis do centro de vacinação ou da unidade de saúde onde a dose foi aplicada. Os dados são inseridos nos sistemas de informação próprios ou integrados à RNDS, no Sistema de Informações do Programa Nacional de Imunizações (SI-PNI) ou Sistema e-SUS Atenção Primária à Saúde (s-SUS APS). Após os dados enviados e processados, são inseridos de forma automática no Conecte SUS, que está disponível pelo celular ou na versão web."

It's also a handy food diary for your baby and nursing mom!\n\nYou will be able to make sure that the newborn is getting enough breast milk and to establish the daily baby care. Enter information about food, beverages, medications and supplements you are taking. This will help identify allergic reactions in the infant.\n\nLACTATION\n\nStart the breastfeeding timer with one click! Track the duration of feedings, easily remember which breast you fed the last time: this will help to establish breastfeeding and avoid lactostasis. Record data on pumping and responses to the first complementary foods.\n\nPUMPING\n\nConsider the volume of expressed milk with the option to start the feeding timer separately for each breast or both at the same time.\nKeep records of frozen milk - make sure you have enough stocks in your milk stash\n\nSLEEP\n\nUse a sleep tracker and note down when your child is asleep and awake. Record night and day sleep to understand baby's sleep and wake patterns\n\nDIAPERS\n\nSchedule your diaper change so you know how many diapers you need. Write urination (with volume as needed) and bowel movements separately\n\nHEALTH, FEEDING\n\nMark various symptoms and temperature, enter data on vitamins,  medicines and vaccination. \nRecord complementary feeding data and track the baby's response. Monitor your baby's weight gain and growth. Watch for teething. Erby is great for visiting a pediatrician.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nRecord bathing and walking, tummy time, games, massage. \n\nSTATISTICS AND HISTORY\n\nView event statistics so you can spot trends and, if necessary, make adjustments to your baby's care. Study your daily routine. A complete history of events, the ability to filter them by type (for example, only walks or pump log) is always at your fingertips.\n\nREMINDERS\n\nSet reminders for the events you need. You will not miss your medication and will not forget to feed or put your child to bed at the right time.\n\nErby is not just a baby development journal, it is a memory of your precious first months with him.\n\nYou can keep a diary for multiple children. Suitable for twins!\n\nOur breast feeding app was created to help even the most sleep-deprived parents keep track of their baby's progress up to one year old by recording daily activities and feeding statistics in this easy-to-use diary.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/erby/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/erby/ios/\n\n\nWe are always glad to receive your questions, suggestions and comments.

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "Integrate cognitive aids into your anaesthetic practice today! The ASCAR app has been designed by clinicians for clinicians with the aim of supporting Operating Theatre (OT) teams to plan and brief for complex cases effectively as well as respond appropriately to crises. The app allows you to carry in your pocket, the ever expanding library of ASCAR cognitive aids – so they are available in their most up-to-date version on your device whenever and wherever you are. Just select the subspecialty to locate the cognitive aid you are looking for… or, alternatively, use our advanced search function. The next time you find yourself in an OT full of responding staff, why not contribute by opening the app to assist the team in focusing on the clinical priorities and avoiding blindspots.\n\nFeatures:\n• Complete ASCAR library: automatically updated suite of cognitive aids from the ASCAR group across the whole array of anaesthetic sub-specialties.\n• Paediatric Dose Calculator: Proprietary paediatric anaesthesia calculator to assist you with looking after our most vulnerable patients.\n• Offline access: all files and our calculator remain accessible – even offline. But any updates will require an internet connection.\n• Advanced search function: to minimise the time and facilitate the ergonomics of finding the aid that you need at that moment of crisis.\n\nAbout us:\nASCAR stands for AnaeSthesia Cognitive Aids and Research. We are a not-for-profit Human Factors interest group that was conceived at the Anaesthetic Department, at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney. Our mission is to support our colleagues to perform excellently during crises, by researching, designing, and testing cognitive aids that are optimised for our high stakes environment. Through an understanding of strong aesthetic design, team dynamics, and ergonomics our goal is to advance the creation of clinical support tools for anaesthetists worldwide."

This process aims to place some distance between the child and the blame shame of soiling. This helps to free them from their fears and may mobilise previously beleaguered resources within the child and their family.  'Externalising' stories have proved valuable in engaging children in behavioural treatment programmes wihtin a family therapy context. However, you may find them useful in combination with your chosen therapeutic style.   The style and content of 'Poo Goes Home to Pooland; was designed to suit the cognitive development stage of children up to around seven years of age. Individually illustrations and accompanying text is intended to promote understanding of toileting matters and relieve anxiety. They cover topics such as sharing unhappy feeling and how to reorganise when you need to poo.  Talking about 'Pooland' might help you to engage in getting control over their poo.\n\nDr Tamsin Black wrote and illustrated ‘Poo Goes Home to Pooland’ in her final year of Doctoral Training in Clinical Psychology at the University of Newcastle and on clinical placement (with John Sands, Consultant Clinical Psychologist) at the Linhope Unit, Ashington, part of Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust. She is now a mother of three and working as a Consultant Clinical Psychologist in East London.\n\nERIC the UK’s only childhood continence charity provides information, support and resources to improve the quality of life of children, young people and their families who suffer from the consequences of wetting and soiling difficulties.

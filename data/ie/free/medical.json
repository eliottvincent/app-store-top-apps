      "label": "The COVID Tracker App can help reduce the spread of coronavirus in Ireland and help everyone stay safe.\n\nIt's easy:\n\n- download the app\n- choose what information you want to share, or not\n- that's it, you are now part of the contact tracing community, helping to keep everyone safe from coronavirus.\n\nIf you use the app you will:\n\n-be alerted if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus\n-be able to track your symptoms and get advice on what to do\n-have the choice to anonymously warn others if you test positive for coronavirus - this will help keep other people safe\n-protect yourself and others as everyone begins to return to normal life\n\nHow the COVID Tracker app works\nThe app has 3 functions:\n\ncontact tracing\nCOVID check-in\nupdates and information\n\n1. Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

      "label": "With MeTime you simply choose the area you want to treat or improve, select your preferences, treatments that may interest you, or simply leave it up to the Providers to make suggestions and recommendations.  You can take photos, select the locations and range for Providers, and what you’re willing to spend.  Once you submit your preferences and photos, Providers in your selected area will contact you through the app to give their expert recommendations and start a chat.  \n\nAREAS\n\nEach Journey in MeTime begins with your selection of areas.  These include face, neck, body, skin, hair, teeth, and intimate.  Within each area you can select specifically what region you want to improve, correct or enhance.  For example, within the face area you can choose eyes, nose, cheeks, face shape, and many more.  Within body you can choose tummy, thighs, breasts, hands, feet, for example.  You can also select skin, hair restoration or removal, teeth restoration, and treatments for intimate areas for women and men.  \n\nPREFERENCES\n\nYou can skip to get recommendations and suggestions from Providers if you prefer and simply upload some photos.  If you know what you want, you can select preferences for each area, such as tightening skin, improving face shape, removing fat, and enhancing lips or features.  Then, you can click on treatments that you are considering such as liposuction, face lifting, fillers, nose surgery, lasers and so on.  You will guide the Providers by selecting how dramatic a change, or subtle, you want your treatment to be, and whether you want something nonsurgical, minimally invasive, or surgical.  \n\nPHOTOS\n\nWith MeTime you have the opportunity to submit photos safely and securely so that Providers can give tailored treatment recommendations without the need to meet you physically.  The MeTime photo upload section guides you through taking photos of appropriate areas at different angles so your Provider can give you the best advice.  You can submit one or more photos, or skip, although photos greatly enhance the ability for Providers to provide accurate advice during the chat.\n\nMATCHING\n\nAs a MeTime user, you can select your current location or a different city to match with Providers, and a range within that location to match with more or fewer Providers!  You can also limit your matching to certain specialties and those with a certain amount of experience.  Adding price range and downtime using the app filters helps Providers give you a more tailored treatment plan.  You’ll then be matched instantly, and you’ll have the chance to remove certain Providers from the match if you choose before your information and photos are submitted.  \n\nCHAT\n\nOnce you submit your MeTime Journey, just sit back and relax and wait for Providers to send you messages to your MeTime inbox!  You can review their recommendations and start a chat with Providers to get more information, send more photos, receive pricing and offers, and make bookings.  You’ll be able to see the profiles of Providers who chat with you to learn more about their expertise and practice.  \n\nCONNECTED AND SAFE\n\nIt’s never been easier to connect with aesthetic providers, get advice and recommendations about what’s right for you, and learn about treatments and updates in aesthetics, health and wellness. You can learn about treatments and stay up to date with exciting blogs, find out what’s best for you, chat with Providers, and send photos safely and securely.  All using MeTime, the app for you!"

Discuss with your healthcare professional how you should use the information displayed on the Dexcom G6 to help manage your diabetes.  \n\n*For a list of compatible smart devices, please visit dexcom.com/compatibility. \n\n†If your glucose alerts and readings from the Dexcom G6 do not match symptoms or expectations, use a blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions.\n\nOnly use this app if you have the Dexcom G6 CGM System.  \n\nDexcom G6 provides real-time glucose readings as frequently as every five minutes. Dexcom G6 is approved for children age 2 and older.\n\nThe Dexcom G6 System provides personalized trend alerts right on your smart device and lets you see when your glucose levels are going too low, or too high, so you can better manage your diabetes. The Alert Schedule feature lets you schedule and customize a second set of alerts.  Custom alert sounds are available, including a Vibrate-Only option on the phone for glucose alerts. The only exception is the Urgent Low Alarm, which you can’t turn off.\n\n\nThe Always Sound setting allows you to receive certain Dexcom CGM Alerts even if your phone sound is off, set to vibrate, or in Do Not Disturb mode. This will allow you to silence calls or texts but still receive audible CGM Urgent Low Alarm and alerts: Low and High Glucose alert, Urgent Low Soon, and Rise and Fall Rate.  Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default. A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.  For safety, the Urgent Low alarm and these alerts can’t be silenced: Transmitter Failed, Sensor Failed, and App Stopped. \n\nIn addition to the accurate performance provided by the Dexcom Sensor, you’ll receive other valuable features:\n\n•\tShare your glucose data with your followers who can monitor your glucose data and trends on their compatible smart device with the Dexcom Follow app. Share and Follow functions require an internet connection\n•\tHealth app access so you can share retrospective glucose data with third party apps\n•\tToday View widget, which allows you to view your glucose data on the lock screen of your smart device\n•\tAsk Siri* to read your current glucose value, using a custom phrase\n•\tA Dexcom CLARITY link on the landscape trend graph lets you easily transition to the CLARITY App to view more information on your glucose trends\n\n*Siri may not be available in all regions. Check Apple’s website to see if Siri is available in your country.\n\n\nApple Watch\n\nView your glucose information, trend graph, and alerts and alarms right from your wrist with the Dexcom G6 Apple Watch app. Watches require compatible smart device to use app.\n\n•\tDexcom G6 watch face complications allow you to view your glucose number and arrow from your watch face"

You will be charged to your iTunes account and will automatically renew within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, unless auto-renewal is disabled beforehand. The subscription is then automatically renewed each year unless auto-renewal is disabled. To manage your subscriptions or to disable auto-renewal, after purchase, go to your iTunes account settings.\n\nSubscription is priced at €5.99 per year:\n\nThe Formulary privacy policy which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_privacy_policy.html\nThe Formulary Terms of Use which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_terms.html\n\nThis app is intended for Healthcare professionals only and as such, before allowing access to the critical information in the Drugs Dosages section, OLCHC requires each user to register to create a record of users that can help verify that any individual user is a medical professional if needed.

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw.

We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

You might want to know if their glucose levels go too high or too low, be able to quickly and easily access their insulin pump and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system information. \r\n \r\nWith the CareLink™ Connect app, now you can remotely see their glucose levels and insulin pump information wherever you are, so you can know how they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app helps you quickly accomplish these tasks: \r\nLet you securely view glucose levels, graphs, and trends\r\nSends you high or low glucose levels notifications, so you can be informed and supportive\r\nShows you the status of the insulin pump system, for greater peace of mind\r\n\r\nTo remotely view pump system information, family members or friends need to install the CareLink™ Connect app on their compatible mobile device. Also, the person with diabetes needs a MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump, the MiniMed™ Mobile app installed on a compatible mobile device, which then should be connected online to the CareLink™ software. To find a list of compatible devices, please visit your local Medtronic website. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: In order to receive real-time updates, the app needs to continuously receive data from the CareLink™ servers, and the insulin pump system needs to sync with the CareLink™ servers through the MiniMed™ Mobile app. The CareLink™ Connect app only works with the MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump systems; it currently does not support other standalone CGM systems, MiniMed™ or Paradigm™ insulin pumps. \r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app is intended to provide a secondary display of insulin pump and CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) system data on a supported mobile device. CareLink™ Connect app is not intended to replace the real-time display of insulin pump or CGM data on the primary display device. All therapy decisions should be based on the primary display device.\r\n\r\nCareLink™ Connect app is not intended to analyze or modify the insulin pump and CGM data that it receives. Nor is it intended to control any function of the insulin pump or CGM system to which it is connected. CareLink™ Connect app is not intended to receive information directly from the insulin pump or CGM system.\r\n\r\nThis app store should not be used as your first point of contact to resolve technical or customer services issues. In order to protect your privacy and personal information, and promptly resolve any technical or customer services issues you are having with any Medtronic product, please contact the local Medtronic support line. \r\n\r\nMedtronic may be required to actively contact customers regarding complaints related to products.

With Siilo, the Red Cross Hospital specialists are demonstrating leadership by sharing knowledge and expertise, even beyond hospital walls.” \n– Dr. Gonneke Hermanides, Infectious Disease Specialist, Red Cross Hospital Beverwijk Netherlands\n\n“The possibilities we have with Siilo are enormous because we can receive very quick responses from our clinical peers securely from all over the country and benefit from different opinions on how best to treat patients.”\n– Professor Holger Nef, a cardiologist and deputy medical director at The University Hospital of Giessen and director of the Heart Centre Rotenburg\n\n“Everyone has interesting patient cases, but that information is not stored nationwide. With Siilo you can search the cases and see if someone asked the question before.”\n– Anke Kylstra, AIOS Hospital Pharmacy in the Maxima Medical Center, JongNVZA board member"

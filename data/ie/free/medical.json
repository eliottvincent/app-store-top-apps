      "label": "The COVID Tracker App can help reduce the spread of coronavirus in Ireland and help everyone stay safe.\n\nIt's easy:\n\n- download the app\n- choose what information you want to share, or not\n- that's it, you are now part of the contact tracing community, helping to keep everyone safe from coronavirus.\n\nIf you use the app you will:\n\n-be alerted if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus\n-be able to track your symptoms and get advice on what to do\n-have the choice to anonymously warn others if you test positive for coronavirus - this will help keep other people safe\n-protect yourself and others as everyone begins to return to normal life\n\nHow the COVID Tracker app works\nThe app has 3 functions:\n\ncontact tracing\nCOVID check-in\nupdates and information\n\n1. Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

      "label": "AI-Dermatologist is an innovative app helping you monitor your skin health and detect any unusual or alerting skin conditions.\nWe all want to have healthy and clear skin, and in order to achieve this result, it is necessary to make an effort and try different skin care methods. We may need a rash identifier, a mole checker, a skin analyzer, or an acne scanner, depending on the problem. The AI-Dermatologist app combines all these functions. We have designed this modern skin analyzer so that by using it on a regular basis, if you suspect a problem, you can contact your healthcare providers in time and avoid complications.\n\nBased on today's most advanced Artificial intelligence technologies and professional knowledge and expertise in dermatology, our application enables you to check all your skin problems for risk assessment: spots, birthmarks, acne, moles or papillomas. In 1 minute AI-Dermatologist gives a result on the next step to be taken. Likewise, AI-Dermatologist gives you the opportunity to store photos to keep track of changes over time and monitor your skin health in the long run. By creating AI-Dermatologist, we supported the idea of making skin screening and monitoring accessible to everyone.\n\nWith AI-Dermatologist you can:\n- Snapshot your skin spots, birth-marks, mole or another skin diseases such as: angioma, warts, papillomas, mollusks and etc.\n- Take / upload photos and track results for changes\n- Get a reminder when it is time to take a new photo, take pills or build a skin care routine \n- Сreate your own scheme for the medicines or cosmetics’ use according to your schedule \n- Track dynamics of baseline and follow-up results\n- Easily log the tracked your skin conditions locations on your body\n\nPlease note that AI-Dermatologist is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace or cancel a visit to your doctor. This application aims to help you be more aware of your skin condition via self-exams, but it is not an online dermatology platform. If you ever feel uncomfortable or see that your skin spot is changing, irritated, itchy or bleeding, we strongly recommend that you contact a medical specialist without hesitation to avoid the risk of melanoma or other skin diseases.\n\nBy signing up for this subscription, you agree to our\nTerms of use http://ai-derm.com/terms/terms_of_use.html\nPrivacy Policy http://ai-derm.com/privacy/privacy.html"

The only exception is the Urgent Low Alarm, which you can’t turn off.\n\n\nThe Always Sound setting allows you to receive certain Dexcom CGM Alerts even if your phone sound is off, set to vibrate, or in Do Not Disturb mode.

Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default. A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.  For safety, the Urgent Low alarm and these alerts can’t be silenced: Transmitter Failed, Sensor Failed, and App Stopped. \n\nIn addition to the accurate performance provided by the Dexcom Sensor, you’ll receive other valuable features:\n\n•\tShare your glucose data with your followers who can monitor your glucose data and trends on their compatible smart device with the Dexcom Follow app. Share and Follow functions require an internet connection\n•\tHealth app access so you can share retrospective glucose data with third party apps\n•\tToday View widget, which allows you to view your glucose data on the lock screen of your smart device\n•\tAsk Siri* to read your current glucose value, using a custom phrase\n•\tA Dexcom CLARITY link on the landscape trend graph lets you easily transition to the CLARITY App to view more information on your glucose trends\n\n*Siri may not be available in all regions.

We have put a lot of work into designing a navigation system that is easy to use so you will have no problem finding the information you need.  The app currently contains four sections:\n\nDrug dosages\nGuidelines & Protocols\nGeneral Information\nParenteral nutrition\n\n\nPlease note that, like the formulary itself, the app will constantly change and update.  Over the course of each version we will be adding to and editing the drug information and guidelines.  All updates will be automatically added to your app when you open it.  \n\n\nA Subscription is required to use Formulary. You will be charged to your iTunes account and will automatically renew within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, unless auto-renewal is disabled beforehand. The subscription is then automatically renewed each year unless auto-renewal is disabled. To manage your subscriptions or to disable auto-renewal, after purchase, go to your iTunes account settings.\n\nSubscription is priced at €5.99 per year:\n\nThe Formulary privacy policy which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_privacy_policy.html\nThe Formulary Terms of Use which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_terms.html\n\nThis app is intended for Healthcare professionals only and as such, before allowing access to the critical information in the Drugs Dosages section, OLCHC requires each user to register to create a record of users that can help verify that any individual user is a medical professional if needed.

Ask your healthcare provider to hear more about Miiskin PRO.\n\n* PHOTOS AND TELEHEALTH with anyone you like. Ask your doctor and healthcare provider about your usage of the app and if they can receive photos for telehealth consultations or triage. Always follow your doctor’s instructions.\n\n* CLOSE-UP PHOTOGRAPHY used for tracking changes in single moles and other local areas on the skin. Miiskin has carefully calibrated the camera for the best possible close-up photography. Log the location on a body chart / map.\n\n* IN-APP COMPARISON allows you to get a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW of your photos so you can more easily compare them for changes over time.\n\n* AUTOMATIC SKIN IMAGING using computer vision and augmented reality technology makes the app capable of taking FULL-BODY IMAGES of you. All you need to do is to place the phone upright on a table with the camera facing the room and it does the rest. Currently available for iPhone XR, XS, 11, 11Pro and SE 2020.\n\n* MOLE SIZING helps you measure your moles and lesions over time. Simply add a coin into your close-up photos.\n\n* FACE TRACKING lets you take selfies from multiple-angles in seconds to track e.g. acne or skincare results\n\n* WEB COMPARE allows you to access your Miiskin App photos in the browser on any tablet or computer with a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW. Very useful for you to compare your full-body images for any changes on a larger screen.\n\n* SECURITY AND PRIVACY is a big priority for us. Miiskin separates your photos from your normal camera roll and encrypts them so no other apps can access them. You can protect them even more with a PIN-code or your Face/Touch ID and BLUR OUT areas of your full-body photos that you wish to stay private even if you share your photos.\n\nMIISKIN DOES NOT PROVIDE A DIAGNOSIS\nThe app does not diagnose your moles or evaluate the risk of melanoma, skin cancer or any other conditions.

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "Experience with us the fascination of newly emerged life. Watch wonderful ultrasound videos of babies in different weeks of pregnancy. If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

Over 1,000,000 people have downloaded our mobile electronic eye charts for iOS. \n\nThis version is our best for iPhone, and it's now completely free.\n\nUseful for:\n- Triaging\n- House visits\n- Patients who have memorized the office chart\n\nFeatures:\n- Randomizable Snellen Chart\n- Randomizable Tumbling E Chart\n- Randomizable Sloan Letters Chart\n- Randomizable Landolt C Chart\n- Randomizable Near Vision Chart (w/subscription)\n- Line Isolation (w/subscription)\n- Amsler Grid (w/subscription)\n- Single optotype charts (w/subscription)\n\nDescription:\n\nEyeChart is a pocket vision screener: randomized Snellen, Sloan, Tumbling E, and Landolt C charts to offer a rough but useful screen of visual acuity. Simply press a button to randomize the entire eye chart, or touch an individual line of the chart to randomize that line. Swipe right for the chart selector.\n\nEye care professionals around the world use Snellen Eye Charts to measure visual acuity. However, patients often memorize the classic Snellen chart, leading to less accurate vision measurements. Enter EyeChart! Though this unique, pocket-sized randomizable eye chart should not be used as a primary visual acuity measuring tool, it can provide a handy rough vision screen when a chart is not available, or it can be used to complement static, wall-based Snellen charts.\n\nSubscription:\n\nIn addition to our free features, EyeChart offers a subscription to exclusive paid features, including the Randomizable Near Vision Chart, Line Isolation, Amsler Grid, and Single Optotype Charts! The subscription costs $0.99 per month of access, and is available through an auto-renewing subscription which will renew each month for your convenience until you choose to turn it off. Please let us know if you have any questions about your subscription at eyechartapp@gmail.com.\n\nCheck out our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy at eyechartproapp.com/termsofuse.\n\nEyeChart was made with the best of intentions, and we hope to continue improving it.

This helps to free them from their fears and may mobilise previously beleaguered resources within the child and their family.  'Externalising' stories have proved valuable in engaging children in behavioural treatment programmes wihtin a family therapy context. However, you may find them useful in combination with your chosen therapeutic style.   The style and content of 'Poo Goes Home to Pooland; was designed to suit the cognitive development stage of children up to around seven years of age. Individually illustrations and accompanying text is intended to promote understanding of toileting matters and relieve anxiety.

Selecting it a second time marks the pill with an X indicating that the pill was missed for that day. Selecting today’s pill a third time will return the pill back to the original “not taken” setting in case you had not taken it. To help avoid any mistakes you will only be able to change your pill status for your current day and past days. The pills for the next day onwards will be disabled.\n\nVirtual blister strips begin with the word “Start” and contain arrows to guide you to the next day.\n\nA reminder is displayed to count down till your next pill. If you’ve missed taking the pill at the set time then the timer changes to indicate the time the pill is overdue by.\n\nBelow that is an approximate count of how many days remain till the start of your menstrual cycle. This is not shown if you have selected Azalia®. Some women may not start bleeding on the first day but within the 7 day break from the pill. If you experience bleeding outside of the 7 days while taking the pill then you may want to consult your GP. For Azalia® when a strip is empty, you must start with a new pack the next day – without interruption and without waiting for bleeding.\n\nWhen you go on holiday to a destination in a different time zone it is important to continue to take your pills at 24 hour intervals. This app will keep that 24 hour timing as long as your phone remains set to Irish time, which may be different to the local time at your holiday destination. For example, if the app is set to remind you daily at 10am Irish Summer Time (i.e. 09:00 GMT) and you travel to Melbourne then you will be reminded to take your next pill at 19:00 local Melbourne time. If you change your app reminder settings to the local time at your destination, then you will need to calculate the difference in hours to make sure your pills are taken at the correct time. It is your responsibility to make sure your pills are being taken correctly.\n\nYou will also be notified with a pop-up message if you’ve not visited the app for more than one day. You can then choose to mark all these previous days with missed or taken pills. These can be adjusted afterwards manually by selecting the pills taken to correct the display and your history records.\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you experience any side effects, please talk to you doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in the patient information leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the HPRA Pharmacovigilance Section at medsafety@hpra.ie, by telephone on +353 (0)1-676 4971, or by fax on +353 (0)1-676 2517.

Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus.

Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

These graphs will show if your contractions are increasing or decreasing over time, as well as allows you to decide when you should go to the hospital or birthing center.\n\nContraction Timer remembers all data and whether you were in the middle of a contraction or not between launches, so you can jump back and forth between this and any another app to distract you during and between contractions.\n\n- Large or full screen buttons to make it super easy for you to start or stop contractions at any time\n- Extremely Simple interface to track each contraction. \n- View your complete contraction history on a single screen.

      "label": "Welcome to our easy-to-use Contraction Timer and Counter that helps you track contractions during pregnancy. Our app uses AI to help you keep track of your contractions, so you can relax and focus on your delivery.\n\nDo you experience frequent, intense contractions that are hard to time? If so, then this app is for you! The Contraction Timer & Counter App makes tracking your contractions simple and straightforward. Simply open the app and press start. You'll then begin timing your contractions by pressing the button each time one begins. The duration and frequency of each contraction will be automatically recorded, making it easy for you to monitor your progress. Give this app a try the next time you're experiencing contractions and see how helpful it can be! You may find it a valuable tool in your journey to becoming a parent. \n\nThe Contraction Timer and Counter App is a great way to keep track of your contractions, whether you're planning a home birth or not. This app helps to track how far apart your contractions are and how strong they are, so you can better determine when it's time to head to the hospital. When you're done, press stop and save your contraction data. You'll then be able to view a summary of everything that happened during your contraction session. This is an important tool for any expectant mother!\n\nConsult your doctor to know how often and for how long you should be contracting.\nThis app is not a medical device; our recommendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the length and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the proper indicators, but labor pains become severe, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than have your baby at home or on the way there. Listen to what your body has to say.\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at hello@mindtastik.com. Your feedback is very important to us.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/Q6vbjMzk\nPrivacy policy: http://mindtastik.com/Mindtastik-privacy-policy.pdf"

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

Bond with your baby instead of trying to remember which breast side to feed from, when your little one pooped or how long it has been since the last nap.\r\n\r\nWe talked with new moms to understand their needs and wishes; that’s how we came up with the SuperMama app. It keeps all newborn’s data readily at hand and lets you be more organized. Besides standard events, you can log info about medicines, baths, allergies and make custom notes. SuperMama app can be a game changer for new parents. It helps you plan your day and gives you more time for yourself, if you’re a mompreneur, for example.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can track with SuperMama:\r\n* Breastfeeding:  log nursing time, set reminders and remember which side you last breastfed on (this is important to avoid plugged milk and mastitis);\r\n* Breast pumping:  track the volume to be sure that there is enough milk pumped;\r\n* Diaper changes:  take care of your baby’s delicate skin and keep track of his/her bowel movements;\r\n* Bottle feeding:  log the volume of formula, pumped milk, water or juice;\r\n* Sleep:  track duration, notice patterns and evaluate the quality of your little angel’s sleeps;\r\n* Growth:  record baby’s weight, height and head circumference, update these numbers whenever you want and watch the progress with growth charts;\r\n* Custom events:  choose from existing (meds, tummy time, complementary foods) or create your own. \r\n\r\nAll data is presented in a slick and easily accessible way. There are also easy-to-read graphs which help to see important trends of baby’s development. We’ve created a tool that benefits mom, baby and dad (yes, he can track child’s activity too!), making those first months of parenting a stress-free experience. Have everything under control with SuperMama!\r\n \r\nShare your views and comments via support@supermama.io and we’ll tweak the app just for you! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nTerms of Service: https://supermama.io/terms\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://supermama.io/privacy"

This tracker makes it simple to record the medicine taken immediately after it’s been taken.\n\nCustomer Service at MedicineTracker@webcoastapps.com provides answers to your all your Medicine Tracker questions.  \n\nThe app is easy to use, and is similar to other successful apps developed by Web Coast Apps.  A calendar displays your history all in one place along with your schedule. \n\nIt is easy to forget, did I take my medicine or I didn’t.  With MST (Medicine Scheduler and Tracker), you can quickly record what you took and when.  The app reminds you when it is time to take which medicine.  System Notification can be turned off, allowing you to check your schedule any time. \n \nThe Medicine Scheduler and Tracker App is made up of 5 parts:\n  1.\tRecord the time medicines are taken.\n  2.\tReporting is on a summary page, to allow you to select a range of dates to see the history (time and quantities) that medicines are taken.\n  3.\tA Calendar page is used to display historical data, and future schedules.\n  4.\tAdd-Edit page to make changes to schedules that have been entered.\n  5.\tSetup pages. This is where a reminder notification can be configured, or the start of the work week can be configured for the calendar, and to setup Schedules.\n\nMedicine Scheduler and Tracker, has many important features, such as local backup, and a calendar to show what was taken and what is scheduled to be taken.\n\nThere is no restriction on the quantity of Meds that can be tracked.  Choose from several methods to set up schedules for taking multiple doses for a Medication. For example: 1.  every so many hours, 2.  number of times between start and end times, or 3. at one of 4 times of the day, eg breakfast, lunch, dinner or bedtime.  Setting up your Medicine schedule is easy and fast.  \n\nA summary page shows your actual time verses your schedule times, for the current day and previous day and your schedule for the next day.  You can even see what Medications you have taken and the quantities, for the different time intervals, eg current week, current month, current year, etc.\n\nThe best feature of Medicine Scheduler and Tracker, MST is its calendar.  The calendar shows both past, current and future medicine schedules.  The calendar is integrated with a log record.  The log record will show each and every Medicine you have taken by the date.  You can sequence back to see records from previous months.\n\nIn SETUP, you can turn off or on reminder notifications, change Header colors, or setup other users to track.

It will work without an external microphone but please be-aware that results may vary as the voice pitch analysis requires a relatively quiet environment and some phone microphones can pickup a lot of background noise.  \n\nThis tool is designed to act as a voice recorder/playback/analyser tool but with useful information such as voice pitch, tones, & volume with resonance and phonetics to be added at a later date. It is mostly intended for use as part of voice therapy, and users should be aiming to use the tool for about 5 minutes a day over several months.  It does not provide lessons or guidance, it is intended to be used as a tool to assist with voice therapy and not as a replacement for voice therapy.\n\n=Privacy=\nNo voice recordings are saved or leave the device.\n\n=Free=\nThis app is available in two flavors; a free advert supported version, and a paid advert-free version.  You can remove the adverts via an in-app purchase in the settings screen.\n\n=Bugs=\nHelp us to improve this app, if it doesn't work, or you have any ideas to help us improve please drop us an email so that we can improve things in the next release!"

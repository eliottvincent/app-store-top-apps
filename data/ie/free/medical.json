These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

We have put a lot of work into designing a navigation system that is easy to use so you will have no problem finding the information you need.  The app currently contains four sections:\n\nDrug dosages\nGuidelines & Protocols\nGeneral Information\nParenteral nutrition\n\n\nPlease note that, like the formulary itself, the app will constantly change and update.  Over the course of each version we will be adding to and editing the drug information and guidelines.  All updates will be automatically added to your app when you open it.  \n\n\nA Subscription is required to use Formulary. You will be charged to your iTunes account and will automatically renew within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, unless auto-renewal is disabled beforehand. The subscription is then automatically renewed each year unless auto-renewal is disabled. To manage your subscriptions or to disable auto-renewal, after purchase, go to your iTunes account settings.\n\nSubscription is priced at €5.99 per year:\n\nThe Formulary privacy policy which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_privacy_policy.html\nThe Formulary Terms of Use which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_terms.html\n\nThis app is intended for Healthcare professionals only and as such, before allowing access to the critical information in the Drugs Dosages section, OLCHC requires each user to register to create a record of users that can help verify that any individual user is a medical professional if needed.

To find a list of compatible devices, please visit your local Medtronic website. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: In order to receive real-time updates, the app needs to continuously receive data from the CareLink™ servers, and the insulin pump system needs to sync with the CareLink™ servers through the MiniMed™ Mobile app. The CareLink™ Connect app only works with the MiniMed™ 700-series insulin pump systems; it currently does not support other standalone CGM systems, MiniMed™ or Paradigm™ insulin pumps. \r\n\r\nThe CareLink™ Connect app is intended to provide a secondary display of insulin pump and CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) system data on a supported mobile device. CareLink™ Connect app is not intended to replace the real-time display of insulin pump or CGM data on the primary display device. All therapy decisions should be based on the primary display device.\r\n\r\nCareLink™ Connect app is not intended to analyze or modify the insulin pump and CGM data that it receives.

      "label": "AnSo is a convenient resource designed to help anaesthetists identify common sonoanatomy, in a time efficient manner, within the busy operating theatre. It has been created by practicing anaesthetists with an interest in teaching ultrasound and regional anaesthesia.\n\nAnSo:\n- provides multiple examples of the sonoanatomy as every individual is different,\n- provides landmark sketches useful for developing pattern recognition of landmark structures, and for trainees to draw in exams,\n- displays the cutaneous, motor, osseous and visceral innervation of the numerous nerve blocks and fascial plane blocks now available, facilitating appropriate block choice and knowledge of expected results,\n- allows combining and comparing block innervation,\n- allows images to be flipped to display both L and R sided orientation,\n- demonstrates functional ergonomics with patient, ultrasound screen and proceduralist positioning essential for efficient practical performance,\n- provides block notes with sonoanatomy tips and practical tips from experienced clinicians which can be invaluable to the learner.\n\nAnSo is not only for regional anaesthesia but includes many other perioperative uses of ultrasound relevant to the anaesthetist, such as:\n-      airway\n-      gastric antrum\n-      vascular access\n-      spine\n-      transthoracic echo\n-      lung signs\n\nAnSo contains:\n- over 250 ultrasound images with over 1500 sonoanatomy colour overlays,\n- innervation images,\n- ergonomic images,\n- landmarks pattern sketches,\n- loops when required for dynamic sonoanatomy,\n- notes with tips from experienced clinicians.\n\nAnSo helps identify not only the target structures but all the surrounding sonoanatomy. This more comprehensive understanding of the sonoanatomy helps detect anatomical variability, improves the safety and efficacy of procedures, and facilitates learning and teaching.\nAnSo has been designed in a format that can be easily updated and distributed to users so the information can be kept as current as possible in this rapidly expanding field.\nAnSo does not require an internet connection to run. Once downloaded all data is stored on your device so it will work anywhere and images will display without any delay.  It can be useful both in and out of theatre, when performing procedures, and when learning or teaching ultrasound. There is no advertising in the app making it pleasant and time efficient to use.\nTerms of use can be found at https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nDownload AnSo today and always have access to this sonoanatomy and nerve block resource."

      "label": "Eat Sleep is the simplest way to track your baby’s eating, sleeping, and diaper habits. It’s designed so you don’t have to mess with timers, alarms, or typing. All the important stuff can be entered with a one-finger tap. View all eat/sleep/diaper events for each day, or view the combined history of any individual activity. As you continue using the app, you’ll be able to view trends from day to day, week to week, or month to month.\n\nUnlike some apps, Eat Sleep isn’t overflowing with features you may not need. A real, working, first-time mom helped design the app so it’s simple and easy to use. Eat Sleep tracks the information your baby’s physician cares about most without being needlessly complicated.\n\nEat Sleep also includes a simple note-taking feature which allows you to track special events or routines. You can also now track multiple children.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nEat – Track how long your baby was breastfed and which side. You can also track the amount of formula or pumped breast milk your baby consumed.\n\nSleep – Simple options and no calendars to mess with. Select when your baby finished sleeping and approximately how long—the app does the rest! Intuitive menus help jog your memory and let you enter blocks of time quickly.\n\nDiaper – Keep tabs on diaper changes and whether diapers were wet, dirty or both. This is especially important for breastfeeding moms who need to know if their baby is eating enough!\n\nBabySync - A paid feature that allows you to back up, share, and collaborate on your child with others!\n\n---\n\nEat Sleep is free but does contains ads. You can simply remove these ads while also supporting the makers of this app through an in-app purchase on the settings screen.\n\n----------\n\nNeed help with the latest version of Eat Sleep? Please email us at eatsleep@makesail.io. We're happy to help!"

      "label": "\"With God all things are possible\"\n(and that includes an amazing birth!)\n- Matthew 19:26\n\nUsing Christian Hypnobirthing, thousands of women around the world have experienced easier, more relaxed births - some even completely pain-free without any medicated pain relief! This is because the scripture-based audio tracks help condition your mind and body to trust in God, and come into a relaxed, faith-filled state. Being in this state helps the body produce oxytocin (the hormone responsible for an efficient labour) and endorphins (your body's natural pain relief). \n\nThe relaxation techniques used in Christian Hypnobirthing can be applied no matter what kind of birth you're having, whether that's an unmedicated physiological birth, a cesarean, or anything in between... If you believe that God is with you throughout your pregnancy, and that birth is a positive and wonderful opportunity to connect with Him and your baby, then that will have a massive impact on your birth experience. \n\nCHRISTIAN HYPNOBIRTHING CAN:\n\n- help you feel more connected to God and your baby during pregnancy and birth\n- increase comfort naturally during birth\n- decrease stress and fear\n- provide comfort and relaxation throughout pregnancy\n\nCAN HYPNOBIRTHING BE CHRISTIAN?\n\nYes!\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions around what hypnobirthing is (some people worry that it’s a form of mind control or ‘not right with God’ etc - which could not be further from the truth).\n\nSimply put, hypnobirthing brings you into a deeply relaxed state, where you’re able to absorb positive affirmations and beliefs about birth while remaining alert and completely in control. In fact, as a Christian, you’ve probably already experienced being in this relaxed state many times, during prayer or worship activities, etc.\n\nListening to Christian Hypnobirthing helps to bring you into this calm, faith-filled state, which can help make birth a more relaxing and joyful experience.\n\nTHE APP FEATURES:\n\nOver an hour of audio tracks including:\n- Breathing and Visualisation exercises\n- Encouraging Scriptures for birth\n- Positive Affirmations\n- Prayers for strength\n- Postpartum encouragement\n\nA ‘Positive Birth’ section with links to birth videos, and more.\n\nBlog and Birth Stories\n\nA 50% discount code for our Printable Birth Affirmation Cards.\n\nDownload Christian Hypnobirthing and benefit from both the relaxing and calming effects of hypnobirthing, combined with the huge strength, love and support that come from our Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, and Holy Spirit.\n\nPlease note Christian Hypnobirthing is designed to help support you in a more comfortable birth, but it is in no way a substitute for the advice or presence of a qualified obstetrician, midwife or other medical caregiver. Please always consult your doctor before making any changes to your pregnancy, birth or lifestyle choices.\n\nwww.christianhypnobirthing.com\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/JAXVq4Ry\nPrivacy policy: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/2wZXCrdl"

Or to gain confidence before performing a procedure you perform less commonly?\n \nThe Dechra Dog & Cat Anaesthesia app is a unique resource designed to put practical, accessible information into the hands of veterinarians, veterinary nurses/technicians and vet students. Developed with specialist veterinary anaesthetists and approved by the Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists (AVA), the app contains suggested anaesthetic protocols for 24 procedures in the dog and 15 in the cat. It is like having a veterinary anaesthetist in your pocket!\n \nEach procedure contains up to date, detailed anaesthetic considerations for the patient including pre-op stabilisation where required, appropriate premedication options, peri-operative analgesia and details about induction, maintenance, monitoring, and recovery. This allows you to choose the most appropriate protocol for every unique patient.\nThe app also contains information about 36 of the most commonly used molecules in dog and cat anaesthesia, allowing you to confidently choose and use the most appropriate molecule for every situation. A suggested dosage and route of administration is given, alongside information about indication, time to onset and duration of action, contraindications and side effects.\nThe app includes an easy to use dose calculator so that you can quickly calculate the doses required for your patient and also allows you to design your own protocols. Each completed protocol can be saved into your favourites folder to use again, or you can email the protocol summary to be saved in the patient’s clinical records, or to be printed.\n\nDechra are advocates of patient safety and are keen to promote best practice anaesthesia. As part of this commitment we have included the AVA Anaesthetic Safety Checklist within the app. The Dechra Dog and Cat Anaesthesia App reinforces Dechra as leaders in veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia and provides unprecedented technical support to veterinary professionals."

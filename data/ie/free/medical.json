      "label": "The COVID Tracker App can help reduce the spread of coronavirus in Ireland and help everyone stay safe.\n\nIt's easy:\n\n- download the app\n- choose what information you want to share, or not\n- that's it, you are now part of the contact tracing community, helping to keep everyone safe from coronavirus.\n\nIf you use the app you will:\n\n-be alerted if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus\n-be able to track your symptoms and get advice on what to do\n-have the choice to anonymously warn others if you test positive for coronavirus - this will help keep other people safe\n-protect yourself and others as everyone begins to return to normal life\n\nHow the COVID Tracker app works\nThe app has 3 functions:\n\ncontact tracing\nCOVID check-in\nupdates and information\n\n1. Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

[1] [2]\r\n\r\nYou can use the FreeStyle LibreLink app to:\r\n\r\n* View your current glucose reading, trend arrow and glucose history\r\n* Receive low or high glucose alarms with FreeStyle Libre 2 sensors [2]\r\n* See reports, such as Time in Range and Daily Patterns\r\n* Share your data with your doctor and family, with your permission\r\n\r\nSMARTPHONE COMPATIBILITY\r\nCompatibility may vary between phones and operating systems. Learn more about compatible phones at http://FreeStyleLibre.com.\r\n\r\nUSING YOUR APP AND READER WITH THE SAME SENSOR\r\nAlarms can only be issued on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader or your phone (not both). To receive alarms on your phone, you must start the sensor with the app. To receive alarms on your FreeStyle Libre 2 reader, you must start the sensor with your reader. Once the sensor has been started with the reader, you can also scan that sensor with your phone.\r\n\r\nRemember that the app and reader do not share data with each other. For complete information on a device, scan your sensor every eight hours with that device; otherwise, your reports will not include all your data.

For more information on how to use FreeStyle LibreLink, refer to the User’s Manual, which can be accessed through the app. If you require a printed User’s Manual, contact Abbott Diabetes Care Customer Support.\r\n\r\nConsult a healthcare professional to confirm if this product is right for you or if you have questions about how to use this product to make treatment decisions.\r\n\r\nLearn more at http://FreeStyleLibre.com.\r\n\r\n[1] If you are using the FreeStyle LibreLink app, you must also have access to a blood glucose monitoring system, as the app does not provide one.  \r\n\r\n[2] Alarms that you receive do not include your glucose reading, so you must scan your sensor to check your glucose.\r\n\r\n[3] Use of FreeStyle LibreLink and LibreLinkUp requires registration with LibreView.\r\n\r\nFreeStyle, Libre, and related brand marks are marks of Abbott.

Bond with your baby instead of trying to remember which breast side to feed from, when your little one pooped or how long it has been since the last nap.\r\n\r\nWe talked with new moms to understand their needs and wishes; that’s how we came up with the SuperMama app. It keeps all newborn’s data readily at hand and lets you be more organized. Besides standard events, you can log info about medicines, baths, allergies and make custom notes. SuperMama app can be a game changer for new parents. It helps you plan your day and gives you more time for yourself, if you’re a mompreneur, for example.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can track with SuperMama:\r\n* Breastfeeding:  log nursing time, set reminders and remember which side you last breastfed on (this is important to avoid plugged milk and mastitis);\r\n* Breast pumping:  track the volume to be sure that there is enough milk pumped;\r\n* Diaper changes:  take care of your baby’s delicate skin and keep track of his/her bowel movements;\r\n* Bottle feeding:  log the volume of formula, pumped milk, water or juice;\r\n* Sleep:  track duration, notice patterns and evaluate the quality of your little angel’s sleeps;\r\n* Growth:  record baby’s weight, height and head circumference, update these numbers whenever you want and watch the progress with growth charts;\r\n* Custom events:  choose from existing (meds, tummy time, complementary foods) or create your own. \r\n\r\nAll data is presented in a slick and easily accessible way. There are also easy-to-read graphs which help to see important trends of baby’s development. We’ve created a tool that benefits mom, baby and dad (yes, he can track child’s activity too!), making those first months of parenting a stress-free experience. Have everything under control with SuperMama!\r\n \r\nShare your views and comments via support@supermama.io and we’ll tweak the app just for you! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nTerms of Service: https://supermama.io/terms\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://supermama.io/privacy"

With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\n\n\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals.

      "label": "Have you had an ACL injury or surgery, a Knee Replacement or a Hip Replacement? This App, developed by a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience, will help you reduce pain, motivate you to do your daily exercises, and keep you engaged with your recovery. \n\nCurovate provides daily video guided physical therapy exercises based on the best knee and hip surgery rehabilitation protocols and guidelines. The exercises within Curovate are based on the best evidence, as well as the clinical experience of a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience.\n\nCurovate can measure your knee or hip joint movements (i.e, range of motion), at home with no special equipment. Curovate requires nothing more than your phone to give you an accurate range of motion measurement in a few seconds - watch the video to see how simple it is! The app also provides progress tracking for every repetition and set of exercise that you complete, shows you your achievements daily, weekly and monthly, and rewards you with badges for your hard work. \n\nThe ultimate goal of knee and hip surgery is to return to the sports and physical activity you love and to get back to your normal life and Curovate can help you achieve these goals.\n\nACL Injury or Surgery - Curovate can be used by people after an ACL injury by selecting the pre-surgery option in the app, or if not planning to have surgery, by selecting the non-operative ACL option in the app. \n\nCurovate is a physical therapy app for people who have had a patellar tendon graft or a hamstring tendon graft used to repair their ACL. Many people also have had a cadaver graft, or  a graft taken from a deceased person, or a quadriceps tendon graft. All of the research states that the rehabilitation and exercises that people need to do after a cadaver or quadriceps tendon graft for an ACL repair is the same as a patellar tendon graft rehabilitation protocol.\n\nTotal Knee Replacement - this is when your entire knee joint is replaced with artificial parts. This is done for people who have osteoarthritis in their knee and they are limited by pain and inability to do their daily activities. If this is you, then Curovate can help.\n\nCurovate provides specific daily and weekly physical therapy exercises to help you recover. You can also measure the exact angle or range of motion of your new knee joint to make sure you are meeting your goals and staying on track for your recovery. The joint replacement of your knee is just the first important step to achieving pain free function of your knee. Now it is crucial that you continue daily exercises to get stronger after surgery. You can do this by starting your knee replacement rehab at home.\n\nThe exercises in the app were developed from rehabilitation guidelines and knee replacement protocols all clearly referenced in the app and 20 years of clinical experience from a physical therapist. Tracking your exercise repetitions, sets and your overall progress is also done by the app so you don’t have to track your daily recovery on paper. If you have questions about if this app can help you after surgery, please email the physical therapist and CEO of Curovate, Nirtal Shah at nirtal@curovate.com\n\nStart your 5 day trial today!\n\nSubscription terms of use:\nYou may purchase an auto-renewing subscription through an In-App Purchase.\n• Auto-renewable subscription\n• 1 month ($8.99 USD), Annual subscription ($45.99 USD)\n• Your subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and will automatically renew (at the duration selected) unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• Current subscription may not be cancelled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n\n• Privacy policy: https://curovate.com/privacypolicy.html\n\n• Subscription terms: https://curovate.com/terms.html"

      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

Zorgkostenfacturen inzien en direct betalen\n- Al jouw zorgdocumenten (zorgkostenfactuur, polis, etc.) bij de hand\n- Openstaande bedragen betalen met iDEAL \n- Betalingsregeling afsluiten voor facturen die je liever niet in één keer betaalt\n\n3. Inzicht in jouw vergoeding en zorgverlener zoeken\n- Je ziet hoeveel je dit jaar nog vergoed krijgt voor o.a. fysiotherapie en de tandarts\n- Altijd een overzicht van jouw verzekeringspakket en de meest gezochte vergoedingen\n- Vind direct een gecontracteerde zorgverlener bij jou in de buurt\n\n4.

Dan kun je de app zelf ook gewoon downloaden en gebruiken. Je hebt als medeverzekerde alleen geen postvak en ontvangt geen facturen van ons. Ben je zelf de hoofdverzekerde en heb je medeverzekerden op jouw polis? Dan kun je via jouw eigen app ook eenvoudig de zorgzaken voor hen regelen.\n\nRegistreer slechts 1 keer\nJe registreert jezelf eenmalig met jouw DigiD inloggegevens. Daarna open je de app met jouw persoonlijke pincode, Touch ID of Face ID.

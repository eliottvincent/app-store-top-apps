Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "Congenital heart defects can be difficult to visualize and explain. Heartpedia, created by Cincinnati Children's Hospital, allows you to interact with 3D models of pediatric heart anomalies and defects. Healthcare providers may use these anatomically-correct models as visual learning tools to help educate patients and families on specific defects and repairs. Heartpedia may also be helpful to patients and families who want to learn more on their own or to share the details of a defect with concerned friends and family. Cincinnati Children’s believes that supplying the right information and tools ultimately results in the highest level of care and the best outcomes. \n\nFEATURES\n\nExplore what a normal, defective and repaired heart looks like for these anomalies and defects:\n\n•Tetralogy of Fallot\n•Coarctation of the Aorta\n•Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome\n•Transposition of the Great Arteries\n•Ventricular Septal Defect\n•Patent Ductus Arteriosus\n•Atrioventricular Septal Defect\n•Atrial Septal Defect\n•Ebstein’s Anomaly\n\nDiscover each defect through the following interactions:\n\n•Toggle between normal, defect and repair views\n•View exterior and various interior heart planes / slices\n•Pan, rotate and zoom\n•Watch video animation with audio description of each defect and repair\n•See labels of key heart structures\n•Read a detailed description of the defect \n\nABOUT CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER\n\nAs one of the top three pediatric hospitals in the United States, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center is dedicated to improving child health locally, nationally and internationally.

      "label": "Join the millions of medical professionals who use MDCalc daily to support clinical decision making at the bedside. Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

We have put a lot of work into designing a navigation system that is easy to use so you will have no problem finding the information you need.  The app currently contains four sections:\n\nDrug dosages\nGuidelines & Protocols\nGeneral Information\nParenteral nutrition\n\n\nPlease note that, like the formulary itself, the app will constantly change and update.  Over the course of each version we will be adding to and editing the drug information and guidelines.  All updates will be automatically added to your app when you open it.  \n\n\nA Subscription is required to use Formulary. You will be charged to your iTunes account and will automatically renew within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, unless auto-renewal is disabled beforehand. The subscription is then automatically renewed each year unless auto-renewal is disabled. To manage your subscriptions or to disable auto-renewal, after purchase, go to your iTunes account settings.\n\nSubscription is priced at €5.99 per year:\n\nThe Formulary privacy policy which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_privacy_policy.html\nThe Formulary Terms of Use which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_terms.html\n\nThis app is intended for Healthcare professionals only and as such, before allowing access to the critical information in the Drugs Dosages section, OLCHC requires each user to register to create a record of users that can help verify that any individual user is a medical professional if needed.

      "label": "With MeTime you simply choose the area you want to treat or improve, select your preferences, treatments that may interest you, or simply leave it up to the Providers to make suggestions and recommendations.  You can take photos, select the locations and range for Providers, and what you’re willing to spend.  Once you submit your preferences and photos, Providers in your selected area will contact you through the app to give their expert recommendations and start a chat.  \n\nAREAS\n\nEach Journey in MeTime begins with your selection of areas.  These include face, neck, body, skin, hair, teeth, and intimate.  Within each area you can select specifically what region you want to improve, correct or enhance.  For example, within the face area you can choose eyes, nose, cheeks, face shape, and many more.  Within body you can choose tummy, thighs, breasts, hands, feet, for example.  You can also select skin, hair restoration or removal, teeth restoration, and treatments for intimate areas for women and men.  \n\nPREFERENCES\n\nYou can skip to get recommendations and suggestions from Providers if you prefer and simply upload some photos.  If you know what you want, you can select preferences for each area, such as tightening skin, improving face shape, removing fat, and enhancing lips or features.  Then, you can click on treatments that you are considering such as liposuction, face lifting, fillers, nose surgery, lasers and so on.  You will guide the Providers by selecting how dramatic a change, or subtle, you want your treatment to be, and whether you want something nonsurgical, minimally invasive, or surgical.  \n\nPHOTOS\n\nWith MeTime you have the opportunity to submit photos safely and securely so that Providers can give tailored treatment recommendations without the need to meet you physically.  The MeTime photo upload section guides you through taking photos of appropriate areas at different angles so your Provider can give you the best advice.  You can submit one or more photos, or skip, although photos greatly enhance the ability for Providers to provide accurate advice during the chat.\n\nMATCHING\n\nAs a MeTime user, you can select your current location or a different city to match with Providers, and a range within that location to match with more or fewer Providers!  You can also limit your matching to certain specialties and those with a certain amount of experience.  Adding price range and downtime using the app filters helps Providers give you a more tailored treatment plan.  You’ll then be matched instantly, and you’ll have the chance to remove certain Providers from the match if you choose before your information and photos are submitted.  \n\nCHAT\n\nOnce you submit your MeTime Journey, just sit back and relax and wait for Providers to send you messages to your MeTime inbox!  You can review their recommendations and start a chat with Providers to get more information, send more photos, receive pricing and offers, and make bookings.  You’ll be able to see the profiles of Providers who chat with you to learn more about their expertise and practice.  \n\nCONNECTED AND SAFE\n\nIt’s never been easier to connect with aesthetic providers, get advice and recommendations about what’s right for you, and learn about treatments and updates in aesthetics, health and wellness. You can learn about treatments and stay up to date with exciting blogs, find out what’s best for you, chat with Providers, and send photos safely and securely.  All using MeTime, the app for you!"

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

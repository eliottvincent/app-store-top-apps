Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them.

Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default. A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.

Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

The app is completely free to use, with no restrictions (there are affiliate links to products where if you decided to buy them a small commission would go to supporting the cost of the app – there would be no cost to you). Snore Doctor is in an experimental phase at the moment, and I would appreciate your help in improving it for my patients.\n\nThis app allows you to record your snoring at night and see the results in the morning.  There is a graph to show you how loud you are, and this is measured in decibels so you can compare it to real life sounds (e.g I snore as loud as a vacuum cleaner or a hand drill etc.).\nYou can also see your average snoring levels over several days or weeks so you can get a better idea of how loud you snore over a long period of time. This is therefore superior to a sleep study in terms of snoring data as they only record noise data from one or two nights at most. People snore at variable levels throughout the week, and getting an average level over a long period of time is very important to understand snoring trends.  It would also help you understand if losing weight, using a device or surgery helped your snoring levels.\nSnore Doctor will also record your snoring so you can hear it back and show it to your friends, family, or doctor later on. You also have the option of sharing your data via social media / email if you wish.\nThe app is easy to use, just place your phone next to your bed (in the same position every night to keep the data consistent), and then press record.  For accuracy the app will calibrate itself by measuring the background noise level first (some people live in noisy built up city areas which can affect your results), and then it will start recording your breathing and snoring. The snoring is then measured above the calibrated background noise level.\nEach night can be tagged so you can see later if alcohol, stress, a mandibular advancement device etc, really does affect your snoring levels over multiple nights."

It is a number associated with a particular type of food to indicate the food's effect on a person's blood glucose (blood sugar) level. The number typically ranges between 50 and 100, where 100 represents pure glucose, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.\n\nThe Glycemic Load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's blood glucose level after eating it. It can be used to apply the Glycemic Index to dieting by connecting the GI number with carbohydrates content in a given serving. It gives an estimation on how much a serving size of food is likely to increase blood-sugar levels.\n\nNet carbs are total carbs minus fiber which is indigestible thus it is considered not to raise blood sugar levels.\n\nDiabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period.\n\nHyperglycemia (also spelled hyperglycaemia or hyperglycæmia), is a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma.\n\nObservational studies demonstrate that people who maintain arterial pressures at the low end of these pressure ranges have much better long-term cardiovascular health.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.creamsoft.com/en/terms-of-use-and-privacy-policy/"

      "label": "GERD, Heartburn and Acid Reflux more than 65% of the adult population in a 12 month period. 20 to 30% have weekly symptoms. You must have experienced it too This app is a great app to have on you iPhone or iPad for reference. Keep yourself abreast with various aspects of GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) – symptoms, causes, complications, diagnosis, medications, treatments, diet, FAQs and much more.\n\nAre you concerned about GERD? No worries. Whether you are a patient, or an enthusiast seeking more information about GERD, this app has been designed to serve as an excellent source of reference.\n\nGERD is primarily associated with faulty lifestyle and diet. The best way to beat the disease is by heightening the awareness of the disease. The app is a sincere effort in this direction.\n\nWe have taken special care to present the information in simple language, coupled with lucid style/explanation.\n\nWith the app, you can carry all the information associated with GERD at your fingertips. We have focused more on educating the users about the disease, so we have made every effort to cover the important topics associated with the disease. All the topics, ranging from the definition of the disease to its symptoms, risk factors, complications, diagnosis, and medications/treatments for the disease, have been explained in detail in various sections of the app.\n\nIt is easier said than done to understand GERD, as there is a lot of confusion among patients surrounding the topic. One of the reasons for the confusion is due to the similarity between the symptoms of the disease (heartburns) with other heart diseases such as angina. You can also find an explanation on what causes a heartburn due to GERD and how it is different from other heart diseases.\n\nApp Features:\n\n 1. Contains description about GERD, its symptoms, causes, complications, diagnosis, medications/treatments, diet and some FAQs about the disease.\n\n 2. Each topic has been described in detail under different sections.\n\n 3. Easy navigation from one section to another.\n\n 4. An 'Info' page to guide the users about the contents of the app.\n\nIt is obvious that a few questions may creep in the minds of users, given the complexity of the concepts related to GERD. We have made a note of this point and added a separate section in which, the answers to the frequently asked questions have been provided briefly to benefit the users.\n\nDisclaimer: The information given in the GERD Heartburn and Acid Reflux app is only intended to educate the users. It should not be considered as a prescription or medical advice. The information provided in this app is meant to help people get informed about the disease, different medicines and diet for GERD. The app does not endorse any medication in particular, either partially or fully. It is strongly recommended to consult a qualified medical doctor or a medical practitioner before taking any action on the basis of any information provided by this app."

      "label": "Children who suffer encopresis often begin to feel that there is little more to them than the problem itself. In 'Poo Goes Home to Pooland', the problem is embodied in a troublesome character and placed externally to the child. This process aims to place some distance between the child and the blame shame of soiling. This helps to free them from their fears and may mobilise previously beleaguered resources within the child and their family.  'Externalising' stories have proved valuable in engaging children in behavioural treatment programmes wihtin a family therapy context. However, you may find them useful in combination with your chosen therapeutic style.   The style and content of 'Poo Goes Home to Pooland; was designed to suit the cognitive development stage of children up to around seven years of age. Individually illustrations and accompanying text is intended to promote understanding of toileting matters and relieve anxiety. They cover topics such as sharing unhappy feeling and how to reorganise when you need to poo.  Talking about 'Pooland' might help you to engage in getting control over their poo.\n\nDr Tamsin Black wrote and illustrated ‘Poo Goes Home to Pooland’ in her final year of Doctoral Training in Clinical Psychology at the University of Newcastle and on clinical placement (with John Sands, Consultant Clinical Psychologist) at the Linhope Unit, Ashington, part of Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust. She is now a mother of three and working as a Consultant Clinical Psychologist in East London.\n\nERIC the UK’s only childhood continence charity provides information, support and resources to improve the quality of life of children, young people and their families who suffer from the consequences of wetting and soiling difficulties.

      "label": "The COVID Tracker App can help reduce the spread of coronavirus in Ireland and help everyone stay safe.\n\nIt's easy:\n\n- download the app\n- choose what information you want to share, or not\n- that's it, you are now part of the contact tracing community, helping to keep everyone safe from coronavirus.\n\nIf you use the app you will:\n\n-be alerted if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus\n-be able to track your symptoms and get advice on what to do\n-have the choice to anonymously warn others if you test positive for coronavirus - this will help keep other people safe\n-protect yourself and others as everyone begins to return to normal life\n\nHow the COVID Tracker app works\nThe app has 3 functions:\n\ncontact tracing\nCOVID check-in\nupdates and information\n\n1. Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

This publication has been used by a wide range of medical staff, predominantly within the hospital itself.\n\nWith iPhones reaching mass penetration in Ireland, the decision was made to launch the app to the digital space, predominantly on iPhone.  \n\nAll the usual sections of the Formulary have been retained.  We have put a lot of work into designing a navigation system that is easy to use so you will have no problem finding the information you need.  The app currently contains four sections:\n\nDrug dosages\nGuidelines & Protocols\nGeneral Information\nParenteral nutrition\n\n\nPlease note that, like the formulary itself, the app will constantly change and update.  Over the course of each version we will be adding to and editing the drug information and guidelines.  All updates will be automatically added to your app when you open it.  \n\n\nA Subscription is required to use Formulary. You will be charged to your iTunes account and will automatically renew within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, unless auto-renewal is disabled beforehand. The subscription is then automatically renewed each year unless auto-renewal is disabled. To manage your subscriptions or to disable auto-renewal, after purchase, go to your iTunes account settings.\n\nSubscription is priced at €5.99 per year:\n\nThe Formulary privacy policy which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_privacy_policy.html\nThe Formulary Terms of Use which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_terms.html\n\nThis app is intended for Healthcare professionals only and as such, before allowing access to the critical information in the Drugs Dosages section, OLCHC requires each user to register to create a record of users that can help verify that any individual user is a medical professional if needed. Data gathered will be used for no other purpose other than the management of this app."

You can take photos, select the locations and range for Providers, and what you’re willing to spend.  Once you submit your preferences and photos, Providers in your selected area will contact you through the app to give their expert recommendations and start a chat.  \n\nAREAS\n\nEach Journey in MeTime begins with your selection of areas.  These include face, neck, body, skin, hair, teeth, and intimate.  Within each area you can select specifically what region you want to improve, correct or enhance.  For example, within the face area you can choose eyes, nose, cheeks, face shape, and many more.  Within body you can choose tummy, thighs, breasts, hands, feet, for example.  You can also select skin, hair restoration or removal, teeth restoration, and treatments for intimate areas for women and men.  \n\nPREFERENCES\n\nYou can skip to get recommendations and suggestions from Providers if you prefer and simply upload some photos.  If you know what you want, you can select preferences for each area, such as tightening skin, improving face shape, removing fat, and enhancing lips or features.  Then, you can click on treatments that you are considering such as liposuction, face lifting, fillers, nose surgery, lasers and so on.  You will guide the Providers by selecting how dramatic a change, or subtle, you want your treatment to be, and whether you want something nonsurgical, minimally invasive, or surgical.  \n\nPHOTOS\n\nWith MeTime you have the opportunity to submit photos safely and securely so that Providers can give tailored treatment recommendations without the need to meet you physically.  The MeTime photo upload section guides you through taking photos of appropriate areas at different angles so your Provider can give you the best advice.  You can submit one or more photos, or skip, although photos greatly enhance the ability for Providers to provide accurate advice during the chat.\n\nMATCHING\n\nAs a MeTime user, you can select your current location or a different city to match with Providers, and a range within that location to match with more or fewer Providers!  You can also limit your matching to certain specialties and those with a certain amount of experience.  Adding price range and downtime using the app filters helps Providers give you a more tailored treatment plan.  You’ll then be matched instantly, and you’ll have the chance to remove certain Providers from the match if you choose before your information and photos are submitted.  \n\nCHAT\n\nOnce you submit your MeTime Journey, just sit back and relax and wait for Providers to send you messages to your MeTime inbox!  You can review their recommendations and start a chat with Providers to get more information, send more photos, receive pricing and offers, and make bookings.  You’ll be able to see the profiles of Providers who chat with you to learn more about their expertise and practice.  \n\nCONNECTED AND SAFE\n\nIt’s never been easier to connect with aesthetic providers, get advice and recommendations about what’s right for you, and learn about treatments and updates in aesthetics, health and wellness. You can learn about treatments and stay up to date with exciting blogs, find out what’s best for you, chat with Providers, and send photos safely and securely.  All using MeTime, the app for you!"

Enhanced Rule of Nines using BMI and Rule of Eights for infants under 10 kg and adults over 80 kg using the Rule of Fives.\n\nThe Total Surface Burn Area (TBSA) is calculated from the drawn regions using the Rule of Nines, Eights, Fives or Lund and Browder. Along with the patient’s weight, height, gender, and chart-type (adult, child, infant), the Parkland Formula is used to determine an accurate amount of fluids to give the patient. Additionally, the provided Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI) can then provide an estimated mortality rate. \n\nKEY FEATURES\nCreate, View, Sort, Search, Edit, and More - Unlike other calculation software, you can view and revise past records. Organize the chart list view by select fields or find results by customized title.\n\nQuick, Efficient and Detailed Calculations - Edit quickly with simple inputs using Quick Calculate. Bypass patient measurement information to quickly draw burn regions and return to add patient details later.\n\nEncrypted & Compliant - Patient charts are stored locally with high-level encryption.\n\nEnhanced Rules - An available option in the application considers the latest medical studies to calculate more accurately based on BMI and body-type.\n\nProfessional Editing Tools - Use the basic Brush tool commonly seen in other software or take advantage of the Lasso tool to quickly draw the entire burn region in one motion!\n\nPan and Zoom! - Two-Finger-Pan, Touch-to-Pan, Pinch-to-Zoom, and more allow for precision results and faster burn region input.\n\nReverse-draw - Reverse side is drawn under the current view to allow the burn pattern to be matched from the anterior to the posterior.\n\nVector-based Graphics - Utilizing point-to-point Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) stores the burn region as a digital value for: Better precision feedback / display, future-proofing as calculations and formulas change, and more.\n\nShare Results - Charts are exportable using the native devices 'Share' feature. Subscribe or purchase individual 'Share Charts' items for full calculation details and advanced file-types such as PDF.\n\nTailored Preferences - Default opening a chart to Move mode to prevent accidental input, or default to Edit mode for faster input.\n\nCustom Basis Values - Enter your weighted basis value that best suits your knowledge and expertise or facility guidelines. Available for adult and child/infant charts separately.\n\nFAQs\nQ. How do calculations work?\nA. Anterior and Posterior body regions are divided into an average total of 35 different parts (hand, lower arm, upper arm, etc.). Each section is then combined into the respective region for display purposes (arm, leg) to give the total value for a more user-friendly view. The system then reduces and evaluates each collection of regions and determines the percentage of the clipped area that is filled-in. Each collection is then totaled and input into the Parkland Formula to determine the amount of fluids to provide.\n\nQ. How are records stored securely?\nA. Patient charts are stored locally with AES-256 using cipher block chaining (CBC) mode and a unique initialization vector (IV) which is never reused within a file, and then signed with a SHA-2 HMAC.\n\nAll data collected is encrypted and used to provide recommendations. All information displayed should be verified and only used with the assistance or advice of a trained licensed professional. Sharing charts is not secure, and is subject to the encryption mechanisms used in the transfer to the selected 3rd-party application(s).\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

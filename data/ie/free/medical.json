Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more!

This helps to free them from their fears and may mobilise previously beleaguered resources within the child and their family.  'Externalising' stories have proved valuable in engaging children in behavioural treatment programmes wihtin a family therapy context. However, you may find them useful in combination with your chosen therapeutic style.   The style and content of 'Poo Goes Home to Pooland; was designed to suit the cognitive development stage of children up to around seven years of age. Individually illustrations and accompanying text is intended to promote understanding of toileting matters and relieve anxiety. They cover topics such as sharing unhappy feeling and how to reorganise when you need to poo.  Talking about 'Pooland' might help you to engage in getting control over their poo.\n\nDr Tamsin Black wrote and illustrated ‘Poo Goes Home to Pooland’ in her final year of Doctoral Training in Clinical Psychology at the University of Newcastle and on clinical placement (with John Sands, Consultant Clinical Psychologist) at the Linhope Unit, Ashington, part of Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust.

      "label": "The incidence of skin cancer has increased steadily worldwide in recent years. Statistically, the probability of developing skin cancer once in a lifetime is about 20%. Early detection is of extreme importance. The earlier skin cancer can be detected, the better the chances of recovery. This is why our group of dermatologists and biomedical engineers have developed SkinScreener, a smart way to determine the personal risk of altered skin areas with an app, in addition to regular dermatological examinations. \n\nA clinical study at the Medical University of Graz (using more than 1500 images of real patients) has proven that SkinScreener has an impressive 95% accuracy rate in the detection of skin cancer.\n\nSkinScreener is a user-friendly app, developed and clinically proven by a team of dermatologists, physicians, and biomedical engineers. SkinScreener enables a quick assessment of the risk of skin cancer in the case of skin lesions (moles, skin spots, birthmarks).\n\nFor this purpose, a photo of the designated skin area is taken with the camera of the smartphone. The image is then run through our clinically proven neural network. The risk status for skin cancer is indicated by an easy to understand 3 color code (low, medium, high risk).\n\nSkinScreener is available as a free download, and users will receive a limited number of free scans after registration. Additional scans are offered as a paid subscription for a period of 1 or 12 months, or as a paid number of scans.\n\nBefore the scan, users must perform a camera test to ensure a working camera and good photo quality. The scan is performed according to the instructions for use. The algorithm calculates the risk assessment for skin cancer at the designated skin area:\nGreen: LOW RISK\nYellow: MEDIUM RISK or \nRed: HIGH RISK\n\nBased on the risk assessment, users are advised to consult a dermatologist for further examination to obtain an accurate medical diagnosis. Users with a \"MEDIUM RISK\" or \"HIGH RISK\" rating should see the dermatologist earlier than the recommended preventive dermatological examinations. The specialist will then verify the results by further specialist examinations.\n\nIn the LOW RISK assessment, the skin lesion should be monitored regularly and rescanned at least once a month.\n\nNevertheless, SkinScreener users should visit their dermatologist for a regular annual dermatological examination.\n\nSkinScreener is registered as a Class I medical device (European Directive 93/42/EEC) and clinically validated by a study at the Medical University of Graz.\n\nSkinScreener is intended for adult users with Fitzpatrick skin type I (ivory) to IV (light brown). SkinScreener must not be used on children.\n\nWe take the protection of your data seriously! Your data will exclusively be stored on European servers and according to the EU Data Protection Directive (GDPR). Your pictures will only be stored anonymously on our servers and will be used to improve our app and for research purposes.\n\nDisclaimer: This app does not replace a physical examination by a doctor. Always seek professional medical advice, especially before making medical decisions. SkinScreener cannot replace a dermatological examination, it does not make a diagnosis and cannot replace the visit of a medical professional.\n\nIndication: To evaluate a lesion on human skin for possible visual signs of skin cancer using a three-level classification (LOW RISK, MEDIUM RISK, or HIGH RISK).\n\nGeneral terms and conditions: https://skinscreener.at/en/terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy policy: https://skinscreener.at/en/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "\"With God all things are possible\"\n(and that includes an amazing birth!)\n- Matthew 19:26\n\nUsing Christian Hypnobirthing, thousands of women around the world have experienced easier, more relaxed births - some even completely pain-free without any medicated pain relief! This is because the scripture-based audio tracks help condition your mind and body to trust in God, and come into a relaxed, faith-filled state. Being in this state helps the body produce oxytocin (the hormone responsible for an efficient labour) and endorphins (your body's natural pain relief). \n\nThe relaxation techniques used in Christian Hypnobirthing can be applied no matter what kind of birth you're having, whether that's an unmedicated physiological birth, a cesarean, or anything in between... If you believe that God is with you throughout your pregnancy, and that birth is a positive and wonderful opportunity to connect with Him and your baby, then that will have a massive impact on your birth experience. \n\nCHRISTIAN HYPNOBIRTHING CAN:\n\n- help you feel more connected to God and your baby during pregnancy and birth\n- increase comfort naturally during birth\n- decrease stress and fear\n- provide comfort and relaxation throughout pregnancy\n\nCAN HYPNOBIRTHING BE CHRISTIAN?\n\nYes!\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions around what hypnobirthing is (some people worry that it’s a form of mind control or ‘not right with God’ etc - which could not be further from the truth).\n\nSimply put, hypnobirthing brings you into a deeply relaxed state, where you’re able to absorb positive affirmations and beliefs about birth while remaining alert and completely in control. In fact, as a Christian, you’ve probably already experienced being in this relaxed state many times, during prayer or worship activities, etc.\n\nListening to Christian Hypnobirthing helps to bring you into this calm, faith-filled state, which can help make birth a more relaxing and joyful experience.\n\nTHE APP FEATURES:\n\nOver an hour of audio tracks including:\n- Breathing and Visualisation exercises\n- Encouraging Scriptures for birth\n- Positive Affirmations\n- Prayers for strength\n- Postpartum encouragement\n\nA ‘Positive Birth’ section with links to birth videos, and more.\n\nBlog and Birth Stories\n\nA 50% discount code for our Printable Birth Affirmation Cards.\n\nDownload Christian Hypnobirthing and benefit from both the relaxing and calming effects of hypnobirthing, combined with the huge strength, love and support that come from our Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, and Holy Spirit.\n\nPlease note Christian Hypnobirthing is designed to help support you in a more comfortable birth, but it is in no way a substitute for the advice or presence of a qualified obstetrician, midwife or other medical caregiver. Please always consult your doctor before making any changes to your pregnancy, birth or lifestyle choices.\n\nwww.christianhypnobirthing.com\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/JAXVq4Ry\nPrivacy policy: https://www.websitepolicies.com/policies/view/2wZXCrdl"

Computer vision is not 100% accurate. scanoma tells you if your image looks like a regular mole or skin cancer based on similar confirmed patient images. \n- Results are only applicable to moles. (a picture of anything other than a mole will not provide reliable results.  (birthmarks, various objects, things that are not moles) \n- The free scanoma AI exam does not replace physical evaluation of skin cancer by a trained doctor. If in doubt, connect with a dermatologist on scanoma for a second opinion (consultation fee),  or have your skin issues physically checked by a local dermatologists. \n- scanoma works best with clear, unobstructed skin images. At this point scanoma does not work with tattooed skin.  \n- scanoma works best with push notifications enabled. Make sure scanoma notifications are enabled by going to settings-> scanoma -> allow notifications\n-Scanoma is not suitable for children. If you child is under the age of 13, please visit a paediatrician for a diagnosis. \n\nFor feedback and questions send us an email to: support@scanoma.com"

Kinsa helps us keep track of everyone’s medical situation!”\n“This has to be one of the best products on the market for families, especially families with little ones!” \n\nThe free Kinsa app works best with Kinsa's award-winning, pediatrician-recommended QuickCare, QuickScan, and Smart Ear thermometers, available for purchase online and in retail stores across the U.S. If you have an older Smart Stick thermometer that plugs into the headphone jack of your phone, please use the Kinsa Smart Stick app instead. \n\nWe hope your family doesn't get sick, but if they do, we'll be there to help your family feel better faster!\n\nAll information, images, and other content shared through Kinsa’s mobile or web applications is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment from an appropriately qualified and licensed physician or other healthcare provider.

It's a good way to look at the whole picture and put your interpretation skills to the test.\"\n\"This collection of ECGs designed as realtime display is an essential app for every medical practitioner.\"\n\"This app is great for anyone learning how to read an EKG\"\n\"Professional ecg app with nice monitor display\"\n\"Awesome app!!! Worth the download and perfect for studying!\"\n\nThe app is very challenging because it uses REAL patients' ECG recordings, and many of them are complicated with multiple diseases involved. The test need you to pick all interpretations, to get a 3-star rate. Wrong picks will buzz your iPhone / iPad and give you a minus score. \n\n[Note] \n1) All cases are stored in raw data (sample rate is 500 points per second), not static images, so you can look into very detailed waves in pixels \n2) You should already have basic knowledge of ECG interpretation, and you use the cases to build a solid cardiology foundation \n\n[Findings Covered] \nAtrial Flutter \nAtrial Fibrillation \nVentricular Fibrillation \nEscape Beat \nPAC (Premature Atrial Contruction) \nPAC Bigeminy \nPAC Trigeminy \nPVC (Premature Ventricular Contruction) \nPVC Bigeminy \nPVC Trigeminy \nSupraventricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Escape Rhythm \nVentricular Rhythm \nQT Prolongation \nShort QT \nHigh T \nST Elevation \nS1,S2,S3 Pattern \nHigh Voltage \nPositive T in V1 \nVentricular Hypertrophy \nLVH \nLeft / Right Atrial Enlargement \nLeft Ventricular Hypertrophy \nLeft Atrial Overload \nShort PR Interval \nWPW Syndrome \nSuspect WPW Syndrome \nAV Block I (Wenckebach / Mobitz) \n2:1 AV Block \nComplete AV Block \nArtificial Pacemaker Rhythm(A / V / D) \nRSR' Pattern \nIRBBB (Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block) \nIVCD (Intraventricular Conduction Block) \nCRBBB (Complete Right Bundle Branch Block) \nCLBBB (Complete Left Bundle Branch Block) \nICLBBB (Incomplete Left Bundle Branch Block) \nLAH (Left Anterior Hemi Block) \nLPH (Left Posterior Hemi Block) \nBBBB (Bifascicular Bundle Block) \nTBBB (Trifascicular Bundle Block) \nFlat T \nNegative T \nST-T Abnormality \nPremature repolarization Syndrome \nPoor R Progression \nAbnormal Q wave \nSubendcardial Infarction \nPossible Anterior Infarction \nAnterior Infarction \nAnteroseptal Infarction \nPossible Lateral Infarction \nLateral Infarction \nInferior Infarction \nPossible High-Post Infarction \nSinus Rhythm \nCoronary Sinus Rhythm \nAV Junctional Rhythm \nAV Dissociation \nMarked Sinus Bradycardia \nSinus Bradycardia \nSinus Tachycardia \nTachycardia \nBradycardia \nExtreme Tachycardia \nExtreme Bradycardia \nSinus Arrhythmia"

It records intervals, amplitude, breathing per minute average, the number of times you get up and your sleeping position and analyzes through an algorithm. It graphically reconstructs every second to detect apnea episodes. It could reduce these episodes through stimuli captured by the consciousness of the sleeper. ApneaSuperviser could help to reach a restful sleep, a better slower, deep sleep rhythm, re-educate how to breathe, decrease fatigue and increases quality of life.\nWhen starting the application, a series of voice instructions prompts the sleeper to take breathes (deep and normal) to measure your expiration and inhalation levels. It programs the reaction of the sleeper to respond to a stimulus. Without waking, stimuli join the sleeper by his lucid level (conscious) sleep to suggest and initiate breathing.\nGraphically, ApneaSuperviser shows you all of your breaths during the night. It can determine which is the best position to adopt when sleeping. You can record a familiar voice for better effect and the application can use it during an apnea episode.\nIt generates a table and evaluate the severity of apnea, mild, moderate or severe. It offers the ability to send data stored in CSV format (tab) to your doctor who may refer you for further study of sleep with polysomnography."

Low FODMAP Lifestyle is the easiest way to look up which foods are high FODMAP and low FODMAP.\n\nThis app is build by Lifeplano and we know what IBS and the low FODMAP diet is about, because one of our founders have followed it himself. It is a very restrictive diet and therefore harder to follow, but we have made it so much easier with Low FODMAP Lifestyle.\n\n*Functionalities*\n- Low FODMAP food list\n- Personal testing of every food\n- More than 40+ recipes\n- Basic knowledge about IBS and FODMAPs\n\n*What is IBS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome?*\nIBS is a condition where your gut have trouble digesting foods with certain carbohydrates: Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Mannitols and Polyols. Which carbohydrates you react too can be different from others, as the amount also can, which is why it is a very personal diet.\n\nIt is estimated by scientists at the Australian Monash University that 1 in 7 suffers from IBS and it is a lifestyle condition mainly present in western countries.\n\n*What is the Low FODMAP Diet?*\nMonash University are also the inventors of the Low FODMAP Diet. It is a diet that helps you find out exactly what carbohydrates and foods your gut reacts to and in what amount, so you can limit or exclude that from your diet going forward.\n\nThe IBS diet consist of three phases:\n- Phase 1: The eliminations phase - Here you eliminate FODMAPs from your diet until you are symptom free.\n- Phase 2: The reintroduction phase - Here you slowly reintroduce the different carbohydrates, and test which ones cause reactions.\n- Phase 3: The personal diet phase - You now have a personal diet, but IBS can develop over time, so you need to retest foods again to see if your tolerance changed.\n\nWith our app you can also test new foods and drinks that haven't been tested yet and see if you tolerate it. Examples could be a can of Pepsi or ketchup which are both processed groceries with unknown levels of FODMAPs.\n\nThe diet can seem very restrictive if you are new to it, and it is proved that restrictive diets are the hardest to follow. With Low FODMAP Lifestyle we have made the diet more available so it seems easier to follow and less restrictive. Follow our low FODMAP recipes, get symptom free and test new foods every week, to make your personal diet and low FODMAP food list.\n\n______________________________\nTerms of use: https://bornly.com/terms-of-service/\n\nMedical disclaimer\nWE ARE NOT DOCTORS AND DO NOT GIVE MEDICAL ADVICE.

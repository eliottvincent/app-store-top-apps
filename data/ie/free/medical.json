      "label": "The COVID Tracker App can help reduce the spread of coronavirus in Ireland and help everyone stay safe.\n\nIt's easy:\n\n- download the app\n- choose what information you want to share, or not\n- that's it, you are now part of the contact tracing community, helping to keep everyone safe from coronavirus.\n\nIf you use the app you will:\n\n-be alerted if you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus\n-be able to track your symptoms and get advice on what to do\n-have the choice to anonymously warn others if you test positive for coronavirus - this will help keep other people safe\n-protect yourself and others as everyone begins to return to normal life\n\nHow the COVID Tracker app works\nThe app has 3 functions:\n\ncontact tracing\nCOVID check-in\nupdates and information\n\n1. Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them. This includes the HSE."

Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

Bond with your baby instead of trying to remember which breast side to feed from, when your little one pooped or how long it has been since the last nap.\r\n\r\nWe talked with new moms to understand their needs and wishes; that’s how we came up with the SuperMama app. It keeps all newborn’s data readily at hand and lets you be more organized. Besides standard events, you can log info about medicines, baths, allergies and make custom notes. SuperMama app can be a game changer for new parents. It helps you plan your day and gives you more time for yourself, if you’re a mompreneur, for example.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can track with SuperMama:\r\n* Breastfeeding:  log nursing time, set reminders and remember which side you last breastfed on (this is important to avoid plugged milk and mastitis);\r\n* Breast pumping:  track the volume to be sure that there is enough milk pumped;\r\n* Diaper changes:  take care of your baby’s delicate skin and keep track of his/her bowel movements;\r\n* Bottle feeding:  log the volume of formula, pumped milk, water or juice;\r\n* Sleep:  track duration, notice patterns and evaluate the quality of your little angel’s sleeps;\r\n* Growth:  record baby’s weight, height and head circumference, update these numbers whenever you want and watch the progress with growth charts;\r\n* Custom events:  choose from existing (meds, tummy time, complementary foods) or create your own. \r\n\r\nAll data is presented in a slick and easily accessible way. There are also easy-to-read graphs which help to see important trends of baby’s development. We’ve created a tool that benefits mom, baby and dad (yes, he can track child’s activity too!), making those first months of parenting a stress-free experience. Have everything under control with SuperMama!\r\n \r\nShare your views and comments via support@supermama.io and we’ll tweak the app just for you! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nTerms of Service: https://supermama.io/terms\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://supermama.io/privacy"

With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name.

      "label": "The incidence of skin cancer has increased steadily worldwide in recent years. Statistically, the probability of developing skin cancer once in a lifetime is about 20%. Early detection is of extreme importance. The earlier skin cancer can be detected, the better the chances of recovery. This is why our group of dermatologists and biomedical engineers have developed SkinScreener, a smart way to determine the personal risk of altered skin areas with an app, in addition to regular dermatological examinations. \n\nA clinical study at the Medical University of Graz (using more than 1500 images of real patients) has proven that SkinScreener has an impressive 95% accuracy rate in the detection of skin cancer.\n\nSkinScreener is a user-friendly app, developed and clinically proven by a team of dermatologists, physicians, and biomedical engineers. SkinScreener enables a quick assessment of the risk of skin cancer in the case of skin lesions (moles, skin spots, birthmarks).\n\nFor this purpose, a photo of the designated skin area is taken with the camera of the smartphone. The image is then run through our clinically proven neural network. The risk status for skin cancer is indicated by an easy to understand 3 color code (low, medium, high risk).\n\nSkinScreener is available as a free download, and users will receive a limited number of free scans after registration. Additional scans are offered as a paid subscription for a period of 1 or 12 months, or as a paid number of scans.\n\nBefore the scan, users must perform a camera test to ensure a working camera and good photo quality. The scan is performed according to the instructions for use. The algorithm calculates the risk assessment for skin cancer at the designated skin area:\nGreen: LOW RISK\nYellow: MEDIUM RISK or \nRed: HIGH RISK\n\nBased on the risk assessment, users are advised to consult a dermatologist for further examination to obtain an accurate medical diagnosis. Users with a \"MEDIUM RISK\" or \"HIGH RISK\" rating should see the dermatologist earlier than the recommended preventive dermatological examinations. The specialist will then verify the results by further specialist examinations.\n\nIn the LOW RISK assessment, the skin lesion should be monitored regularly and rescanned at least once a month.\n\nNevertheless, SkinScreener users should visit their dermatologist for a regular annual dermatological examination.\n\nSkinScreener is registered as a Class I medical device (European Directive 93/42/EEC) and clinically validated by a study at the Medical University of Graz.\n\nSkinScreener is intended for adult users with Fitzpatrick skin type I (ivory) to IV (light brown). SkinScreener must not be used on children.\n\nWe take the protection of your data seriously! Your data will exclusively be stored on European servers and according to the EU Data Protection Directive (GDPR). Your pictures will only be stored anonymously on our servers and will be used to improve our app and for research purposes.\n\nDisclaimer: This app does not replace a physical examination by a doctor. Always seek professional medical advice, especially before making medical decisions. SkinScreener cannot replace a dermatological examination, it does not make a diagnosis and cannot replace the visit of a medical professional.\n\nIndication: To evaluate a lesion on human skin for possible visual signs of skin cancer using a three-level classification (LOW RISK, MEDIUM RISK, or HIGH RISK).\n\nGeneral terms and conditions: https://skinscreener.at/en/terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy policy: https://skinscreener.at/en/privacy-policy/"

We have put a lot of work into designing a navigation system that is easy to use so you will have no problem finding the information you need.  The app currently contains four sections:\n\nDrug dosages\nGuidelines & Protocols\nGeneral Information\nParenteral nutrition\n\n\nPlease note that, like the formulary itself, the app will constantly change and update.  Over the course of each version we will be adding to and editing the drug information and guidelines.

You will be charged to your iTunes account and will automatically renew within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, unless auto-renewal is disabled beforehand. The subscription is then automatically renewed each year unless auto-renewal is disabled.

Discuss with your healthcare professional how you should use the information displayed on the Dexcom G6 to help manage your diabetes.  \n\n*For a list of compatible smart devices, please visit dexcom.com/compatibility. \n\n†If your glucose alerts and readings from the Dexcom G6 do not match symptoms or expectations, use a blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions.\n\nOnly use this app if you have the Dexcom G6 CGM System.  \n\nDexcom G6 provides real-time glucose readings as frequently as every five minutes. Dexcom G6 is approved for children age 2 and older.\n\nThe Dexcom G6 System provides personalized trend alerts right on your smart device and lets you see when your glucose levels are going too low, or too high, so you can better manage your diabetes. The Alert Schedule feature lets you schedule and customize a second set of alerts.  Custom alert sounds are available, including a Vibrate-Only option on the phone for glucose alerts. The only exception is the Urgent Low Alarm, which you can’t turn off.\n\n\nThe Always Sound setting allows you to receive certain Dexcom CGM Alerts even if your phone sound is off, set to vibrate, or in Do Not Disturb mode. This will allow you to silence calls or texts but still receive audible CGM Urgent Low Alarm and alerts: Low and High Glucose alert, Urgent Low Soon, and Rise and Fall Rate.  Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default. A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.  For safety, the Urgent Low alarm and these alerts can’t be silenced: Transmitter Failed, Sensor Failed, and App Stopped. \n\nIn addition to the accurate performance provided by the Dexcom Sensor, you’ll receive other valuable features:\n\n•\tShare your glucose data with your followers who can monitor your glucose data and trends on their compatible smart device with the Dexcom Follow app. Share and Follow functions require an internet connection\n•\tHealth app access so you can share retrospective glucose data with third party apps\n•\tToday View widget, which allows you to view your glucose data on the lock screen of your smart device\n•\tAsk Siri* to read your current glucose value, using a custom phrase\n•\tA Dexcom CLARITY link on the landscape trend graph lets you easily transition to the CLARITY App to view more information on your glucose trends\n\n*Siri may not be available in all regions. Check Apple’s website to see if Siri is available in your country.\n\n\nApple Watch\n\nView your glucose information, trend graph, and alerts and alarms right from your wrist with the Dexcom G6 Apple Watch app. Watches require compatible smart device to use app.\n\n•\tDexcom G6 watch face complications allow you to view your glucose number and arrow from your watch face"

Scanoma checks your moles, tells you if your image resembles confirmed skin cancer images, and connects you with trained dermatologists for a professional second opinion.\n\nWith the power of computer vision and the expertise of licensed medical practitioners, scanoma helps your learn about skin issues and get feedback on worrisome skin problems. Simply snap a picture of your mole and then send it to a scanoma doctor for a checkup. \n\nWith scanoma, get a free diagnosis with our AI algorithm trained from thousands of images and get a second opinion from a trained dermatologist from the privacy of your home and using your iPhone. Detect skin cancer risks today.\n\nTake care of your skin and make sure you get it checked often with scanoma. \n\nSupport:\nsupport@scanoma.com\n\nDISCLAIMERS \n-------\n- Scanoma does not replace a human doctor. Computer vision is not 100% accurate. scanoma tells you if your image looks like a regular mole or skin cancer based on similar confirmed patient images. \n- Results are only applicable to moles. (a picture of anything other than a mole will not provide reliable results.  (birthmarks, various objects, things that are not moles) \n- The free scanoma AI exam does not replace physical evaluation of skin cancer by a trained doctor. If in doubt, connect with a dermatologist on scanoma for a second opinion (consultation fee),  or have your skin issues physically checked by a local dermatologists. \n- scanoma works best with clear, unobstructed skin images. At this point scanoma does not work with tattooed skin.  \n- scanoma works best with push notifications enabled. Make sure scanoma notifications are enabled by going to settings-> scanoma -> allow notifications\n-Scanoma is not suitable for children. If you child is under the age of 13, please visit a paediatrician for a diagnosis. \n\nFor feedback and questions send us an email to: support@scanoma.com"

      "label": "\"Most credible OCD App\" - One Mind PsyberGuide\nGG OCD is a one-stop-shop for simple, research backed mental health exercises. \nJoin the thousands already using the app, reducing anxiety and experiencing better well being by self-managing their condition.\n\nCHANGING OBSESSIVE THINKING IS SIMPLE\nDiscard unsupportive thoughts. Embrace positive ones. Learn to identify your inner monologue and respond quickly. Train daily for 14 days, 3 minutes each day, and improve your wellness.\n\nTHE SCIENCE BACKED APP\nNew findings support the effectiveness of the core mechanism used in GG OCD.\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, obsessive, OCD and maladaptive thinking.\n\nHOW GG OCD WORKS\nThe app is designed to:\n1. Increase your awareness of unhelpful thinking habits\n2. Train you to identify and challenge unhelpful thoughts\n3. Increase your access to helpful and positive thoughts\n4. Increase the automaticity of the above processes\n5. Reduce anxiety and depression\n6. Provide daily mood and self-esteem boost\n\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool\n2. It helps build and maintain healthy thinking habits\n3. It is shown to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries and obsessions\n\nSTATEMENTS (OR THOUGHTS)\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\nThe longer we exercise and make it a habit, the more automatic this process becomes.\n\nLEVELS AND TOPICS\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 40 levels. Each level has a pool of self talk statements (or thoughts).\n\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, sin, harm, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty in the world, fear of abandonment, fear of contamination and more.\n\nYou can also test yourself to see how well you progress with our self assessment tool.\n\n3 minutes a day? Are you kidding?\nWhen we started working on the app, we knew that if we want to have a positive impact on people's mental health, we'd better make it easy for them to improve. We designed the 3 minute daily exercise program, and began studying the effect. Fortunately, the results were good. \n\nRemember: positive change doesn't happen during training. It happens when you utilize supportive thinking in real life.\n\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious obsessive cycle.\n---\nIN-APP PURCHASE INFORMATION\n\nThe app includes 15 free levels for training on some of the basic topics. The rest of the levels (over 30) can be accessed with a purchase. There are 2 purchase options:\n\n1. AUTO RENEWABLE SUBSCRIPTION\nFor $11.99 a month, you can train as long as you find the app useful.\nFor $59.99 ($5 per month) you can build and maintain a healthy habit for a whole year\n\n2. PERMANENT SUBSCRIPTION\nPay once to unlock all content forever (including upcoming expansions and additional journeys).\n\nPrivacy policy: \nhttp://ggtude.com/privacy-policy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://ggtude.com/terms-of-use\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information on this app is not intended to be a substitution for diagnosis, treatment, or informed professional advice. You should not take any action or avoid taking any action without consulting with a qualified mental health professional."

      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

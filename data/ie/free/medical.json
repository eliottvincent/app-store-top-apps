Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them.

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

It helps you plan your day and gives you more time for yourself, if you’re a mompreneur, for example.\r\n\r\nHere is what you can track with SuperMama:\r\n* Breastfeeding:  log nursing time, set reminders and remember which side you last breastfed on (this is important to avoid plugged milk and mastitis);\r\n* Breast pumping:  track the volume to be sure that there is enough milk pumped;\r\n* Diaper changes:  take care of your baby’s delicate skin and keep track of his/her bowel movements;\r\n* Bottle feeding:  log the volume of formula, pumped milk, water or juice;\r\n* Sleep:  track duration, notice patterns and evaluate the quality of your little angel’s sleeps;\r\n* Growth:  record baby’s weight, height and head circumference, update these numbers whenever you want and watch the progress with growth charts;\r\n* Custom events:  choose from existing (meds, tummy time, complementary foods) or create your own. \r\n\r\nAll data is presented in a slick and easily accessible way. There are also easy-to-read graphs which help to see important trends of baby’s development. We’ve created a tool that benefits mom, baby and dad (yes, he can track child’s activity too!), making those first months of parenting a stress-free experience. Have everything under control with SuperMama!\r\n \r\nShare your views and comments via support@supermama.io and we’ll tweak the app just for you! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nTerms of Service: https://supermama.io/terms\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://supermama.io/privacy"

Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves.

      "label": "Sleepio is an online sleep improvement program proven to help you clear your mind, get better sleep, and have better days.\n\nSleepio isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. It incorporates your unique needs to create a personalized six-week program that you complete at your own pace. Each session builds on the last, guiding you step-by-step through methods proven to help you quiet your racing mind, reshape your behaviors, and get better sleep — all in about 20 minutes per week.\n\nThe program uses cognitive behavioral techniques that are backed by decades of clinical research, and has undergone more testing than some of the most common sleep medications. In 12 randomized controlled trials with over 13,000 people, Sleepio was proven to help participants fall asleep 54% faster, spend 62% less time awake at night, and have 45% better functioning the next day. You’ll have access to all of this clinical evidence from directly within the app.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n- A personalized program of clinically proven cognitive and behavioral techniques, designed to get your sleep schedule, thoughts, and lifestyle into shape over six tailored sessions.\n\n- A comprehensive onboarding approach with an in-depth questionnaire that shapes your tailored program experience.\n\n- A Sleep Diary to track your progress and monitor your sleep efficiency as you work towards your sleep goals.\n\n- Instant, bite-sized support through the “Help Me Now” feature to get back on track after a long night or rough morning.\n\n“The most effective, long-term solution for poor sleep is a cognitive and behavioral approach, which addresses the mental and behavioral parts of the individual's sleep pattern,” shared Professor Espie. “These approaches help the person to think and behave differently in relation to their sleep, which encourages good sleep to return. Sleepio is a clinically proven digital sleep improvement program that uses cognitive and behavioral techniques to help users with persistent sleep problems.”\n\nDisclaimer: In the US, Sleepio has not been cleared by the FDA for use in diagnosis or treatment of a disease or condition, such as insomnia disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or major depressive disorder."

      "label": "This application is intended for the users of the following contraceptive pill brands:-\n\nCilique® 250/35 microgram tablets\nAzalia® 75 microgram film-coated tablets\nElvina® 0.03mg/3mg film-coated tablets\nElvinette® 0.02mg/3mg film-coated tablets\nOvreena® 30 micrograms/150 micrograms coated tablets\t\nViolite™ 100/20 micrograms film-coated tablets\n\n\nOnce the app is installed and launched on your phone, you can use the settings to:\n\nChoose your specific brand \nChoose your pill start date\nEnter your preferred daily reminder time\nCustomize your reminder message if you want it to be discreet\nSet a pin to secure the app and keep it private\nYou have an option to click on today’s pill on the virtual blister strip to confirm you’ve taken the pill for the day. Selecting it a second time marks the pill with an X indicating that the pill was missed for that day. Selecting today’s pill a third time will return the pill back to the original “not taken” setting in case you had not taken it. To help avoid any mistakes you will only be able to change your pill status for your current day and past days. The pills for the next day onwards will be disabled.\n\nVirtual blister strips begin with the word “Start” and contain arrows to guide you to the next day.\n\nA reminder is displayed to count down till your next pill. If you’ve missed taking the pill at the set time then the timer changes to indicate the time the pill is overdue by.\n\nBelow that is an approximate count of how many days remain till the start of your menstrual cycle. This is not shown if you have selected Azalia®. Some women may not start bleeding on the first day but within the 7 day break from the pill. If you experience bleeding outside of the 7 days while taking the pill then you may want to consult your GP. For Azalia® when a strip is empty, you must start with a new pack the next day – without interruption and without waiting for bleeding.\n\nWhen you go on holiday to a destination in a different time zone it is important to continue to take your pills at 24 hour intervals. This app will keep that 24 hour timing as long as your phone remains set to Irish time, which may be different to the local time at your holiday destination. For example, if the app is set to remind you daily at 10am Irish Summer Time (i.e. 09:00 GMT) and you travel to Melbourne then you will be reminded to take your next pill at 19:00 local Melbourne time. If you change your app reminder settings to the local time at your destination, then you will need to calculate the difference in hours to make sure your pills are taken at the correct time. It is your responsibility to make sure your pills are being taken correctly.\n\nYou will also be notified with a pop-up message if you’ve not visited the app for more than one day. You can then choose to mark all these previous days with missed or taken pills. These can be adjusted afterwards manually by selecting the pills taken to correct the display and your history records.\n\nReporting of side effects\n\nIf you experience any side effects, please talk to you doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in the patient information leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the HPRA Pharmacovigilance Section at medsafety@hpra.ie, by telephone on +353 (0)1-676 4971, or by fax on +353 (0)1-676 2517. By reporting side effects, you provide more information on the safety of this medicine. If you have a medical query about a Consilient Health medicine, please contact Consilient Health at drugsafety@consilienthealth.com or by telephone on +353 (0)1 2057766.\n\nIE/OCS/1116/0027b Date of Prep September 2020."

Low FODMAP Lifestyle is the easiest way to look up which foods are high FODMAP and low FODMAP.\n\nThis app is build by Lifeplano and we know what IBS and the low FODMAP diet is about, because one of our founders have followed it himself. It is a very restrictive diet and therefore harder to follow, but we have made it so much easier with Low FODMAP Lifestyle.\n\n*Functionalities*\n- Low FODMAP food list\n- Personal testing of every food\n- More than 40+ recipes\n- Basic knowledge about IBS and FODMAPs\n\n*What is IBS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome?*\nIBS is a condition where your gut have trouble digesting foods with certain carbohydrates: Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Mannitols and Polyols. Which carbohydrates you react too can be different from others, as the amount also can, which is why it is a very personal diet.\n\nIt is estimated by scientists at the Australian Monash University that 1 in 7 suffers from IBS and it is a lifestyle condition mainly present in western countries.\n\n*What is the Low FODMAP Diet?*\nMonash University are also the inventors of the Low FODMAP Diet. It is a diet that helps you find out exactly what carbohydrates and foods your gut reacts to and in what amount, so you can limit or exclude that from your diet going forward.\n\nThe IBS diet consist of three phases:\n- Phase 1: The eliminations phase - Here you eliminate FODMAPs from your diet until you are symptom free.\n- Phase 2: The reintroduction phase - Here you slowly reintroduce the different carbohydrates, and test which ones cause reactions.\n- Phase 3: The personal diet phase - You now have a personal diet, but IBS can develop over time, so you need to retest foods again to see if your tolerance changed.\n\nWith our app you can also test new foods and drinks that haven't been tested yet and see if you tolerate it. Examples could be a can of Pepsi or ketchup which are both processed groceries with unknown levels of FODMAPs.\n\nThe diet can seem very restrictive if you are new to it, and it is proved that restrictive diets are the hardest to follow. With Low FODMAP Lifestyle we have made the diet more available so it seems easier to follow and less restrictive. Follow our low FODMAP recipes, get symptom free and test new foods every week, to make your personal diet and low FODMAP food list.\n\n______________________________\nTerms of use: https://bornly.com/terms-of-service/\n\nMedical disclaimer\nWE ARE NOT DOCTORS AND DO NOT GIVE MEDICAL ADVICE.

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "If you have migraine or get frequent headaches, you may benefit from keeping a headache diary.\nKeeping detailed records of headache episodes can help provide additional insight about triggers and how to avoid them.\n\nThis app is designed to help you understand and manage your headachesby recording information about them and any treatments used (medicine and non-medicine options).\nYour doctor will want to know the overall pattern of your headaches, how they affect you, the treatments used and what the triggers may be. Doctors and people who experience frequent and persistent headaches have found that keeping a diary for one month can help you and your doctor get more from your consultation. \n\nUse our headache diary to:\n- Track the frequency of your headaches, the treatments used and how effective they were for you\n- Understand your headache experience / patterns including symptoms and triggers\n- Be better prepared to discuss your headache with your health professional.\n\nIt is important to write down information about your headaches. Every time you have a headache, make notes in your diary. This information will help you and your healthcare provider learn about your headaches. This will also help you and your health provider make a plan for treating your headache. \n\nIt is also important to make an appointment with your doctor for the specific purpose of addressing your headache history rather than discussing headaches as part of a physician visit for other reasons. We also recommend keeping a headache diary to track the characteristics of your headaches. Patterns identified from your diary may help your doctor determine which type of headache you have and the most beneficial treatments."

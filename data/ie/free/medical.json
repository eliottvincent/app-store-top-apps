Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default.

Diante disso, o Conecte SUS, a partir da implementação da Rede Nacional de Dados em Saúde (RNDS), foi redirecionado para receber e compartilhar informações que auxiliem no controle da situação de emergência da saúde pública, com destaque ao processo de vacinação Covid-19 no Brasil.\nFuncionalidades:\nAcesse os resultados de exames realizados por qualquer laboratório no território nacional integrado à RNDS para a detecção da Covid-19;\nVeja seu histórico de vacinação na Carteira de Vacinação Digital;\n*No momento, o Conecte SUS apenas apresenta os dados relacionados à vacinação contra a Covid-19, especificando a data da aplicação, o nome da vacina, o lote, o estabelecimento de saúde e o código do vacinador. Gradativamente serão disponibilizadas as demais vacinas ministradas pelo SUS.\nEmita o Certificado Nacional de Vacinação Covid-19 na palma da mão. \nApós as duas doses da vacina (ou a dose única) serem registradas pelos estados ou municípios na RNDS¹, é possível emitir o certificado em pdf nos idiomas português, inglês e espanhol. Esse documento é válido em todo território nacional e pode ser autenticado gratuitamente, utilizando o leitor ValidaQRCode no próprio aplicativo ou digitando o código do documento em:\n https://validacertidao.saude.gov.br/;\n*No certificado é especificado os dados cadastrais da pessoa vacinada (nome, data de nascimento, sexo, CPF), data e horário de emissão, além de informações sobre as doses administradas, como a data de aplicação, nome da vacina, lote e estabelecimento de saúde. \nAcesse o histórico de internação hospitalar no SUS;\n*Dados a partir de abril de 2018.\n·      Veja os medicamentos dispensados pela Farmácia Popular;\nLocalize rapidamente os estabelecimentos mais próximos como os serviços de Saúde Bucal e Doenças Raras;\nConsulte dicas nutricionais e de atividades físicas e verifique o Índice de Massa Corporal (IMC) na funcionalidade “Peso Saudável”;\n \nQuer saber mais?\nAcesso o Conecte SUS na web em: https://conectesus-paciente.saude.gov.br/\nAcesse os portais:\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/conecte-sus\nhttps://www.gov.br/pt-br/servicos/certificado-nacional-de-vacinacao-covid-19\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/saude-digital\nhttps://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br/assuntos/rnds\n¹ Os registros são de responsabilidade dos gestores estaduais e municipais de saúde, que fazem a coleta e envio das informações para a base de dados do Ministério da Saúde. Eles são feitos pelas equipes responsáveis do centro de vacinação ou da unidade de saúde onde a dose foi aplicada. Os dados são inseridos nos sistemas de informação próprios ou integrados à RNDS, no Sistema de Informações do Programa Nacional de Imunizações (SI-PNI) ou Sistema e-SUS Atenção Primária à Saúde (s-SUS APS).

      "label": "Sleepio is an online sleep improvement program proven to help you clear your mind, get better sleep, and have better days.\n\nSleepio isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. It incorporates your unique needs to create a personalized six-week program that you complete at your own pace. Each session builds on the last, guiding you step-by-step through methods proven to help you quiet your racing mind, reshape your behaviors, and get better sleep — all in about 20 minutes per week.\n\nThe program uses cognitive behavioral techniques that are backed by decades of clinical research, and has undergone more testing than some of the most common sleep medications. In 12 randomized controlled trials with over 13,000 people, Sleepio was proven to help participants fall asleep 54% faster, spend 62% less time awake at night, and have 45% better functioning the next day. You’ll have access to all of this clinical evidence from directly within the app.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n- A personalized program of clinically proven cognitive and behavioral techniques, designed to get your sleep schedule, thoughts, and lifestyle into shape over six tailored sessions.\n\n- A comprehensive onboarding approach with an in-depth questionnaire that shapes your tailored program experience.\n\n- A Sleep Diary to track your progress and monitor your sleep efficiency as you work towards your sleep goals.\n\n- Instant, bite-sized support through the “Help Me Now” feature to get back on track after a long night or rough morning.\n\n“The most effective, long-term solution for poor sleep is a cognitive and behavioral approach, which addresses the mental and behavioral parts of the individual's sleep pattern,” shared Professor Espie. “These approaches help the person to think and behave differently in relation to their sleep, which encourages good sleep to return. Sleepio is a clinically proven digital sleep improvement program that uses cognitive and behavioral techniques to help users with persistent sleep problems.”\n\nDisclaimer: In the US, Sleepio has not been cleared by the FDA for use in diagnosis or treatment of a disease or condition, such as insomnia disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or major depressive disorder."

In addition, you can add contextual information to each entry by either associating it with a pre-defined event (such as a doctor’s appointment) or with individual notes.\n\nWith the built-in reminder, you can set Asthma Tracker to remind you to take your daily base medication, to measure your peak flow and to record your symptoms. At the end of each month, it will also prompt you to complete the widely-known Asthma Control Test™ whose intent is to give you a rough idea as to how well controlled your asthma is.\n\nThe aggregated information in Asthma Tracker's chronological overview leverages the Health app to let you quickly asses how your asthma is progressing. Asthma Tracker stores and displays peak flow values stored in the Health app as well as puffs and symptoms alongside your daily step count. This way you can easily see how your daily activity influences your asthma and related symptoms.\n\nSelect individual days to get a more detailed view of each entry (peak flow, puffs or symptoms) on that particular day as well as the recorded step counts on that day.\n\nShare your recorded asthma entries with your doctor during an appointment or take an in-depth look at it yourself on your desktop or other device with a bigger screen using the built-in integration with datalinker.io, our fully end-to-end encrypted solution for secure data transmission. Just visit web.datalinker.io, scan the QR code with Asthma Tracker and your entries are encrypted on your iPhone and copied securely to datalinker for temporal storage. From there you can show it to your doctor, print or save it to PDF.\n\nDo you have feedback for us or do you need help? Visit us at www.asthma-app.com and use the feedback form on our website."

      "label": "Have you had an ACL injury or surgery, a Knee Replacement or a Hip Replacement? This App, developed by a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience, will help you reduce pain, motivate you to do your daily exercises, and keep you engaged with your recovery. \n\nCurovate provides daily video guided physical therapy exercises based on the best knee and hip surgery rehabilitation protocols and guidelines. The exercises within Curovate are based on the best evidence, as well as the clinical experience of a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience.\n\nCurovate can measure your knee or hip joint movements (i.e, range of motion), at home with no special equipment. Curovate requires nothing more than your phone to give you an accurate range of motion measurement in a few seconds - watch the video to see how simple it is! The app also provides progress tracking for every repetition and set of exercise that you complete, shows you your achievements daily, weekly and monthly, and rewards you with badges for your hard work. \n\nThe ultimate goal of knee and hip surgery is to return to the sports and physical activity you love and to get back to your normal life and Curovate can help you achieve these goals.\n\nACL Injury or Surgery - Curovate can be used by people after an ACL injury by selecting the pre-surgery option in the app, or if not planning to have surgery, by selecting the non-operative ACL option in the app. \n\nCurovate is a physical therapy app for people who have had a patellar tendon graft or a hamstring tendon graft used to repair their ACL. Many people also have had a cadaver graft, or  a graft taken from a deceased person, or a quadriceps tendon graft. All of the research states that the rehabilitation and exercises that people need to do after a cadaver or quadriceps tendon graft for an ACL repair is the same as a patellar tendon graft rehabilitation protocol.\n\nTotal Knee Replacement - this is when your entire knee joint is replaced with artificial parts. This is done for people who have osteoarthritis in their knee and they are limited by pain and inability to do their daily activities. If this is you, then Curovate can help.\n\nCurovate provides specific daily and weekly physical therapy exercises to help you recover. You can also measure the exact angle or range of motion of your new knee joint to make sure you are meeting your goals and staying on track for your recovery. The joint replacement of your knee is just the first important step to achieving pain free function of your knee. Now it is crucial that you continue daily exercises to get stronger after surgery. You can do this by starting your knee replacement rehab at home.\n\nThe exercises in the app were developed from rehabilitation guidelines and knee replacement protocols all clearly referenced in the app and 20 years of clinical experience from a physical therapist. Tracking your exercise repetitions, sets and your overall progress is also done by the app so you don’t have to track your daily recovery on paper. If you have questions about if this app can help you after surgery, please email the physical therapist and CEO of Curovate, Nirtal Shah at nirtal@curovate.com\n\nStart your 5 day trial today!\n\nSubscription terms of use:\nYou may purchase an auto-renewing subscription through an In-App Purchase.\n• Auto-renewable subscription\n• 1 month ($8.99 USD), Annual subscription ($45.99 USD)\n• Your subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and will automatically renew (at the duration selected) unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• Current subscription may not be cancelled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n\n• Privacy policy: https://curovate.com/privacypolicy.html\n\n• Subscription terms: https://curovate.com/terms.html"

      "label": "Worried about a mole? A skin blemish that's changing color or appearing to grow in size?

Simply snap a picture of your mole and then send it to a scanoma doctor for a checkup. \n\nWith scanoma, get a free diagnosis with our AI algorithm trained from thousands of images and get a second opinion from a trained dermatologist from the privacy of your home and using your iPhone. Detect skin cancer risks today.\n\nTake care of your skin and make sure you get it checked often with scanoma. \n\nSupport:\nsupport@scanoma.com\n\nDISCLAIMERS \n-------\n- Scanoma does not replace a human doctor. Computer vision is not 100% accurate. scanoma tells you if your image looks like a regular mole or skin cancer based on similar confirmed patient images. \n- Results are only applicable to moles. (a picture of anything other than a mole will not provide reliable results.  (birthmarks, various objects, things that are not moles) \n- The free scanoma AI exam does not replace physical evaluation of skin cancer by a trained doctor. If in doubt, connect with a dermatologist on scanoma for a second opinion (consultation fee),  or have your skin issues physically checked by a local dermatologists. \n- scanoma works best with clear, unobstructed skin images. At this point scanoma does not work with tattooed skin.  \n- scanoma works best with push notifications enabled. Make sure scanoma notifications are enabled by going to settings-> scanoma -> allow notifications\n-Scanoma is not suitable for children. If you child is under the age of 13, please visit a paediatrician for a diagnosis. \n\nFor feedback and questions send us an email to: support@scanoma.com"

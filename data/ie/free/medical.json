Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them.

Scanoma checks your moles, tells you if your image resembles confirmed skin cancer images, and connects you with trained dermatologists for a professional second opinion.\n\nWith the power of computer vision and the expertise of licensed medical practitioners, scanoma helps your learn about skin issues and get feedback on worrisome skin problems. Simply snap a picture of your mole and then send it to a scanoma doctor for a checkup. \n\nWith scanoma, get a free diagnosis with our AI algorithm trained from thousands of images and get a second opinion from a trained dermatologist from the privacy of your home and using your iPhone. Detect skin cancer risks today.\n\nTake care of your skin and make sure you get it checked often with scanoma. \n\nSupport:\nsupport@scanoma.com\n\nDISCLAIMERS \n-------\n- Scanoma does not replace a human doctor. Computer vision is not 100% accurate. scanoma tells you if your image looks like a regular mole or skin cancer based on similar confirmed patient images. \n- Results are only applicable to moles. (a picture of anything other than a mole will not provide reliable results.  (birthmarks, various objects, things that are not moles) \n- The free scanoma AI exam does not replace physical evaluation of skin cancer by a trained doctor. If in doubt, connect with a dermatologist on scanoma for a second opinion (consultation fee),  or have your skin issues physically checked by a local dermatologists. \n- scanoma works best with clear, unobstructed skin images. At this point scanoma does not work with tattooed skin.  \n- scanoma works best with push notifications enabled. Make sure scanoma notifications are enabled by going to settings-> scanoma -> allow notifications\n-Scanoma is not suitable for children. If you child is under the age of 13, please visit a paediatrician for a diagnosis. \n\nFor feedback and questions send us an email to: support@scanoma.com"

For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "Sleepio is an online sleep improvement program proven to help you clear your mind, get better sleep, and have better days.\n\nSleepio isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. It incorporates your unique needs to create a personalized six-week program that you complete at your own pace. Each session builds on the last, guiding you step-by-step through methods proven to help you quiet your racing mind, reshape your behaviors, and get better sleep — all in about 20 minutes per week.\n\nThe program uses cognitive behavioral techniques that are backed by decades of clinical research, and has undergone more testing than some of the most common sleep medications. In 12 randomized controlled trials with over 13,000 people, Sleepio was proven to help participants fall asleep 54% faster, spend 62% less time awake at night, and have 45% better functioning the next day. You’ll have access to all of this clinical evidence from directly within the app.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n- A personalized program of clinically proven cognitive and behavioral techniques, designed to get your sleep schedule, thoughts, and lifestyle into shape over six tailored sessions.\n\n- A comprehensive onboarding approach with an in-depth questionnaire that shapes your tailored program experience.\n\n- A Sleep Diary to track your progress and monitor your sleep efficiency as you work towards your sleep goals.\n\n- Instant, bite-sized support through the “Help Me Now” feature to get back on track after a long night or rough morning.\n\n“The most effective, long-term solution for poor sleep is a cognitive and behavioral approach, which addresses the mental and behavioral parts of the individual's sleep pattern,” shared Professor Espie. “These approaches help the person to think and behave differently in relation to their sleep, which encourages good sleep to return. Sleepio is a clinically proven digital sleep improvement program that uses cognitive and behavioral techniques to help users with persistent sleep problems.”\n\nDisclaimer: In the US, Sleepio has not been cleared by the FDA for use in diagnosis or treatment of a disease or condition, such as insomnia disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or major depressive disorder."

You can take photos, select the locations and range for Providers, and what you’re willing to spend.  Once you submit your preferences and photos, Providers in your selected area will contact you through the app to give their expert recommendations and start a chat.  \n\nAREAS\n\nEach Journey in MeTime begins with your selection of areas.  These include face, neck, body, skin, hair, teeth, and intimate.  Within each area you can select specifically what region you want to improve, correct or enhance.  For example, within the face area you can choose eyes, nose, cheeks, face shape, and many more.  Within body you can choose tummy, thighs, breasts, hands, feet, for example.  You can also select skin, hair restoration or removal, teeth restoration, and treatments for intimate areas for women and men.  \n\nPREFERENCES\n\nYou can skip to get recommendations and suggestions from Providers if you prefer and simply upload some photos.  If you know what you want, you can select preferences for each area, such as tightening skin, improving face shape, removing fat, and enhancing lips or features.  Then, you can click on treatments that you are considering such as liposuction, face lifting, fillers, nose surgery, lasers and so on.  You will guide the Providers by selecting how dramatic a change, or subtle, you want your treatment to be, and whether you want something nonsurgical, minimally invasive, or surgical.  \n\nPHOTOS\n\nWith MeTime you have the opportunity to submit photos safely and securely so that Providers can give tailored treatment recommendations without the need to meet you physically.  The MeTime photo upload section guides you through taking photos of appropriate areas at different angles so your Provider can give you the best advice.  You can submit one or more photos, or skip, although photos greatly enhance the ability for Providers to provide accurate advice during the chat.\n\nMATCHING\n\nAs a MeTime user, you can select your current location or a different city to match with Providers, and a range within that location to match with more or fewer Providers!  You can also limit your matching to certain specialties and those with a certain amount of experience.  Adding price range and downtime using the app filters helps Providers give you a more tailored treatment plan.  You’ll then be matched instantly, and you’ll have the chance to remove certain Providers from the match if you choose before your information and photos are submitted.  \n\nCHAT\n\nOnce you submit your MeTime Journey, just sit back and relax and wait for Providers to send you messages to your MeTime inbox!  You can review their recommendations and start a chat with Providers to get more information, send more photos, receive pricing and offers, and make bookings.  You’ll be able to see the profiles of Providers who chat with you to learn more about their expertise and practice.  \n\nCONNECTED AND SAFE\n\nIt’s never been easier to connect with aesthetic providers, get advice and recommendations about what’s right for you, and learn about treatments and updates in aesthetics, health and wellness. You can learn about treatments and stay up to date with exciting blogs, find out what’s best for you, chat with Providers, and send photos safely and securely.  All using MeTime, the app for you!"

This publication has been used by a wide range of medical staff, predominantly within the hospital itself.\n\nWith iPhones reaching mass penetration in Ireland, the decision was made to launch the app to the digital space, predominantly on iPhone.  \n\nAll the usual sections of the Formulary have been retained.  We have put a lot of work into designing a navigation system that is easy to use so you will have no problem finding the information you need.  The app currently contains four sections:\n\nDrug dosages\nGuidelines & Protocols\nGeneral Information\nParenteral nutrition\n\n\nPlease note that, like the formulary itself, the app will constantly change and update.  Over the course of each version we will be adding to and editing the drug information and guidelines.  All updates will be automatically added to your app when you open it.  \n\n\nA Subscription is required to use Formulary. You will be charged to your iTunes account and will automatically renew within 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period, unless auto-renewal is disabled beforehand. The subscription is then automatically renewed each year unless auto-renewal is disabled. To manage your subscriptions or to disable auto-renewal, after purchase, go to your iTunes account settings.\n\nSubscription is priced at €5.99 per year:\n\nThe Formulary privacy policy which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_privacy_policy.html\nThe Formulary Terms of Use which may be viewed at http://mobanode.mobi/formulary_terms.html\n\nThis app is intended for Healthcare professionals only and as such, before allowing access to the critical information in the Drugs Dosages section, OLCHC requires each user to register to create a record of users that can help verify that any individual user is a medical professional if needed. Data gathered will be used for no other purpose other than the management of this app."

Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

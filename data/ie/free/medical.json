Contact tracing\n\nContact tracing identifies people who were in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. For example, family members, friends, colleagues or fellow travellers.\n\nThe app will help contact tracing by:\n\nreducing the time it takes to alert you if you're a close contact\nnotifying close contacts that might have been forgotten\nenabling us to contact people who are unknown to each other\nThe app uses Bluetooth technology and anonymous IDs to log:\n\n-any phone you are in contact with that also has the app installed\n-the distances between your phone and other phones that use the app\n-the length of time your phone is near other phones that use the app \n\nEvery 2 hours the app on your phone downloads a list of anonymous IDs. These have been shared with the HSE by people using the app who have tested positive for coronavirus. \n\nIf you have been closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with any of these phones you will receive a notification that you are a close contact.\n\nClose contact alerts\nIf the app finds that you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will get an alert.\n\nYou'll be advised to:\n\n-restrict your movements\n-get tested for coronavirus\n\nYou won't know who the contact is or where the contact happened.\n\nIf you test positive\nIf you test positive for coronavirus, you can choose to use the app to anonymously alert other app users you have been in close contact with.\n\nAlerting your close contacts\nOur contact tracing team will phone you if you test positive. They will ask you if you have the app.\n\nIf you have the app, they will ask you to share your set of anonymous IDs through the app. It's your choice if you want to do this.\n\nThe contact tracing team will send you a unique upload code by text message. This code unlocks the upload functionality on the app.\n\nYou can then upload your anonymous IDs for the last 14 days.\n\nOnly the HSE can issue upload codes. People who do not have the virus will not be able to use this function.\n\n2. COVID check-in\n\nYou can use this to:\n\n-track how you feel each day\n-find out if you have symptoms of coronavirus\n-get advice on what to do\n\nAny information you share on the app is anonymous. \n\nOptional information sharing\nWhen you first use the app you'll have the option to share:\n\n- your county or town\n- the age group you are in\n- your sex\n\nThis information can help us to map and predict the spread of the virus. We will not ask for precise details about your age or where you live.\n\n3. Updates and information\n\nYou can use the app to get the latest facts and figures about coronavirus in Ireland. You can also get advice to help you to care for yourself if you are sick.\n\nPrivacy\nYour data is collected anonymously and stored on your phone. Your name, location or movements are not tracked.\n\nYou will be asked to allow the app to collect:\n\n- your anonymous data\n- anonymous data sent by other app users' devices\n\nYou can choose:\n\n- what data you want to share\n- to change your privacy settings at any time\n- to use the app without sharing any data at all\n\nNo one will ever know your personal details unless you choose to share them.

We may need a rash identifier, a mole checker, a skin analyzer, or an acne scanner, depending on the problem. The AI-Dermatologist app combines all these functions. We have designed this modern skin analyzer so that by using it on a regular basis, if you suspect a problem, you can contact your healthcare providers in time and avoid complications.\n\nBased on today's most advanced Artificial intelligence technologies and professional knowledge and expertise in dermatology, our application enables you to check all your skin problems for risk assessment: spots, birthmarks, acne, moles or papillomas. In 1 minute AI-Dermatologist gives a result on the next step to be taken. Likewise, AI-Dermatologist gives you the opportunity to store photos to keep track of changes over time and monitor your skin health in the long run. By creating AI-Dermatologist, we supported the idea of making skin screening and monitoring accessible to everyone.\n\nWith AI-Dermatologist you can:\n- Snapshot your skin spots, birth-marks, mole or another skin diseases such as: angioma, warts, papillomas, mollusks and etc.\n- Take / upload photos and track results for changes\n- Get a reminder when it is time to take a new photo, take pills or build a skin care routine \n- Сreate your own scheme for the medicines or cosmetics’ use according to your schedule \n- Track dynamics of baseline and follow-up results\n- Easily log the tracked your skin conditions locations on your body\n\nPlease note that AI-Dermatologist is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace or cancel a visit to your doctor. This application aims to help you be more aware of your skin condition via self-exams, but it is not an online dermatology platform. If you ever feel uncomfortable or see that your skin spot is changing, irritated, itchy or bleeding, we strongly recommend that you contact a medical specialist without hesitation to avoid the risk of melanoma or other skin diseases.\n\nBy signing up for this subscription, you agree to our\nTerms of use http://ai-derm.com/terms/terms_of_use.html\nPrivacy Policy http://ai-derm.com/privacy/privacy.html"

Discuss with your healthcare professional how you should use the information displayed on the Dexcom G6 to help manage your diabetes.  \n\n*For a list of compatible smart devices, please visit dexcom.com/compatibility. \n\n†If your glucose alerts and readings from the Dexcom G6 do not match symptoms or expectations, use a blood glucose meter to make diabetes treatment decisions.\n\nOnly use this app if you have the Dexcom G6 CGM System.  \n\nDexcom G6 provides real-time glucose readings as frequently as every five minutes. Dexcom G6 is approved for children age 2 and older.\n\nThe Dexcom G6 System provides personalized trend alerts right on your smart device and lets you see when your glucose levels are going too low, or too high, so you can better manage your diabetes. The Alert Schedule feature lets you schedule and customize a second set of alerts.  Custom alert sounds are available, including a Vibrate-Only option on the phone for glucose alerts. The only exception is the Urgent Low Alarm, which you can’t turn off.\n\n\nThe Always Sound setting allows you to receive certain Dexcom CGM Alerts even if your phone sound is off, set to vibrate, or in Do Not Disturb mode. This will allow you to silence calls or texts but still receive audible CGM Urgent Low Alarm and alerts: Low and High Glucose alert, Urgent Low Soon, and Rise and Fall Rate.  Please note that when your phone is set to Silent or Do Not Disturb, you will not receive any audible alerts for Signal Loss.  Always Sound is on by default. A Home screen icon shows you if your Alerts will sound or not.  For safety, the Urgent Low alarm and these alerts can’t be silenced: Transmitter Failed, Sensor Failed, and App Stopped. \n\nIn addition to the accurate performance provided by the Dexcom Sensor, you’ll receive other valuable features:\n\n•\tShare your glucose data with your followers who can monitor your glucose data and trends on their compatible smart device with the Dexcom Follow app. Share and Follow functions require an internet connection\n•\tHealth app access so you can share retrospective glucose data with third party apps\n•\tToday View widget, which allows you to view your glucose data on the lock screen of your smart device\n•\tAsk Siri* to read your current glucose value, using a custom phrase\n•\tA Dexcom CLARITY link on the landscape trend graph lets you easily transition to the CLARITY App to view more information on your glucose trends\n\n*Siri may not be available in all regions.

Essentially a voice analyser for transgender, LSVT, singers, and voice therapy patients to help improve the quality of their voice.\n\n-View a graph of your voice pitch/associated gender in a real-time!\n-Phonetically balanced sentences for you to read\n-Listen to tones of specific pitches for you to mimic\n-Record & playback without saving files to your device\n-Real-time volume analysis\n-Transgender & non-binary friendly\n\nPlease note; this app does NOT change the pitch of your voice, it only provides visual feedback specifically tailed for use as part of voice therapy!!!\n\nThe voice pitch analysis works best with an external microphone! It will work without an external microphone but please be-aware that results may vary as the voice pitch analysis requires a relatively quiet environment and some phone microphones can pickup a lot of background noise.  \n\nThis tool is designed to act as a voice recorder/playback/analyser tool but with useful information such as voice pitch, tones, & volume with resonance and phonetics to be added at a later date. It is mostly intended for use as part of voice therapy, and users should be aiming to use the tool for about 5 minutes a day over several months.  It does not provide lessons or guidance, it is intended to be used as a tool to assist with voice therapy and not as a replacement for voice therapy.\n\n=Privacy=\nNo voice recordings are saved or leave the device.\n\n=Free=\nThis app is available in two flavors; a free advert supported version, and a paid advert-free version.  You can remove the adverts via an in-app purchase in the settings screen.\n\n=Bugs=\nHelp us to improve this app, if it doesn't work, or you have any ideas to help us improve please drop us an email so that we can improve things in the next release!"

Also, all Bluetooth data stored on your phone is automatically deleted after 25 days.\n\nTraceTogether helps us ensure that we don’t spread the virus to our loved ones unknowingly. It also helps us support the work of contact tracers and healthcare workers by combating the spread of COVID-19 together.\n\nApp functionality will cease once the outbreak ends.\n\nTraceTogether is designed for use by people in Singapore. To register, you will need a valid NRIC, FIN, or a valid document of your current stay in Singapore."

      "label": "The incidence of skin cancer has increased steadily worldwide in recent years. Statistically, the probability of developing skin cancer once in a lifetime is about 20%. Early detection is of extreme importance. The earlier skin cancer can be detected, the better the chances of recovery. This is why our group of dermatologists and biomedical engineers have developed SkinScreener, a smart way to determine the personal risk of altered skin areas with an app, in addition to regular dermatological examinations. \n\nA clinical study at the Medical University of Graz (using more than 1500 images of real patients) has proven that SkinScreener has an impressive 95% accuracy rate in the detection of skin cancer.\n\nSkinScreener is a user-friendly app, developed and clinically proven by a team of dermatologists, physicians, and biomedical engineers. SkinScreener enables a quick assessment of the risk of skin cancer in the case of skin lesions (moles, skin spots, birthmarks).\n\nFor this purpose, a photo of the designated skin area is taken with the camera of the smartphone. The image is then run through our clinically proven neural network. The risk status for skin cancer is indicated by an easy to understand 3 color code (low, medium, high risk).\n\nSkinScreener is available as a free download, and users will receive a limited number of free scans after registration. Additional scans are offered as a paid subscription for a period of 1 or 12 months, or as a paid number of scans.\n\nBefore the scan, users must perform a camera test to ensure a working camera and good photo quality. The scan is performed according to the instructions for use. The algorithm calculates the risk assessment for skin cancer at the designated skin area:\nGreen: LOW RISK\nYellow: MEDIUM RISK or \nRed: HIGH RISK\n\nBased on the risk assessment, users are advised to consult a dermatologist for further examination to obtain an accurate medical diagnosis. Users with a \"MEDIUM RISK\" or \"HIGH RISK\" rating should see the dermatologist earlier than the recommended preventive dermatological examinations. The specialist will then verify the results by further specialist examinations.\n\nIn the LOW RISK assessment, the skin lesion should be monitored regularly and rescanned at least once a month.\n\nNevertheless, SkinScreener users should visit their dermatologist for a regular annual dermatological examination.\n\nSkinScreener is registered as a Class I medical device (European Directive 93/42/EEC) and clinically validated by a study at the Medical University of Graz.\n\nSkinScreener is intended for adult users with Fitzpatrick skin type I (ivory) to IV (light brown). SkinScreener must not be used on children.\n\nWe take the protection of your data seriously! Your data will exclusively be stored on European servers and according to the EU Data Protection Directive (GDPR). Your pictures will only be stored anonymously on our servers and will be used to improve our app and for research purposes.\n\nDisclaimer: This app does not replace a physical examination by a doctor. Always seek professional medical advice, especially before making medical decisions. SkinScreener cannot replace a dermatological examination, it does not make a diagnosis and cannot replace the visit of a medical professional.\n\nIndication: To evaluate a lesion on human skin for possible visual signs of skin cancer using a three-level classification (LOW RISK, MEDIUM RISK, or HIGH RISK).\n\nGeneral terms and conditions: https://skinscreener.at/en/terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy policy: https://skinscreener.at/en/privacy-policy/"

Ask your healthcare provider to hear more about Miiskin PRO.\n\n* PHOTOS AND TELEHEALTH with anyone you like. Ask your doctor and healthcare provider about your usage of the app and if they can receive photos for telehealth consultations or triage. Always follow your doctor’s instructions.\n\n* CLOSE-UP PHOTOGRAPHY used for tracking changes in single moles and other local areas on the skin. Miiskin has carefully calibrated the camera for the best possible close-up photography. Log the location on a body chart / map.\n\n* IN-APP COMPARISON allows you to get a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW of your photos so you can more easily compare them for changes over time.\n\n* AUTOMATIC SKIN IMAGING using computer vision and augmented reality technology makes the app capable of taking FULL-BODY IMAGES of you. All you need to do is to place the phone upright on a table with the camera facing the room and it does the rest. Currently available for iPhone XR, XS, 11, 11Pro and SE 2020.\n\n* MOLE SIZING helps you measure your moles and lesions over time. Simply add a coin into your close-up photos.\n\n* FACE TRACKING lets you take selfies from multiple-angles in seconds to track e.g. acne or skincare results\n\n* WEB COMPARE allows you to access your Miiskin App photos in the browser on any tablet or computer with a SIDE-BY-SIDE VIEW. Very useful for you to compare your full-body images for any changes on a larger screen.\n\n* SECURITY AND PRIVACY is a big priority for us. Miiskin separates your photos from your normal camera roll and encrypts them so no other apps can access them. You can protect them even more with a PIN-code or your Face/Touch ID and BLUR OUT areas of your full-body photos that you wish to stay private even if you share your photos.\n\nMIISKIN DOES NOT PROVIDE A DIAGNOSIS\nThe app does not diagnose your moles or evaluate the risk of melanoma, skin cancer or any other conditions. The app assists you with tracking skin and moles over time with a photo diary. We do not think that with today’s technology, and the present quality of smartphone images, that it is possible to provide AI diagnoses of melanoma or skin cancer risk. Therefore, we opt not to attempt to do that.\n\nIf you find a mole or mark that looks concerning you should always consult a certified doctor.\n\nTHE VISION OF MIISKIN\nMiiskin’s vision is to help you keep track of skin changes and skin conditions in the most user-friendly way possible.\n\nMIISKIN PREMIUM\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "Snore Doctor is a brand new app by Dr Vik Veer, who is a world renowned Snoring & Sleep Apnoea surgeon. The app is completely free to use, with no restrictions (there are affiliate links to products where if you decided to buy them a small commission would go to supporting the cost of the app – there would be no cost to you). Snore Doctor is in an experimental phase at the moment, and I would appreciate your help in improving it for my patients.\n\nThis app allows you to record your snoring at night and see the results in the morning.  There is a graph to show you how loud you are, and this is measured in decibels so you can compare it to real life sounds (e.g I snore as loud as a vacuum cleaner or a hand drill etc.).\nYou can also see your average snoring levels over several days or weeks so you can get a better idea of how loud you snore over a long period of time. This is therefore superior to a sleep study in terms of snoring data as they only record noise data from one or two nights at most. People snore at variable levels throughout the week, and getting an average level over a long period of time is very important to understand snoring trends.  It would also help you understand if losing weight, using a device or surgery helped your snoring levels.\nSnore Doctor will also record your snoring so you can hear it back and show it to your friends, family, or doctor later on. You also have the option of sharing your data via social media / email if you wish.\nThe app is easy to use, just place your phone next to your bed (in the same position every night to keep the data consistent), and then press record.  For accuracy the app will calibrate itself by measuring the background noise level first (some people live in noisy built up city areas which can affect your results), and then it will start recording your breathing and snoring. The snoring is then measured above the calibrated background noise level.\nEach night can be tagged so you can see later if alcohol, stress, a mandibular advancement device etc, really does affect your snoring levels over multiple nights."

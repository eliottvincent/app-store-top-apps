Whether you ride the train, subway, bus, light rail, ferry or metro, use dockless scooters, bikes, ride-sharing like Uber or Lyft, getting the best urban mobility information is critical. Enter Moovit! Moovit provides riders with a one-stop-shop journey experience to help them get from point A to B in the easiest and most efficient way.

Purchase bus & train tickets and validate your digital pass with a tap (select cities). \n\n► Real time alerts. Know about issues ahead of time by receiving service alerts such as emergency or unexpected disruptions, delays, traffic jams, new construction, and more so that you can plan ahead if your bus time or train time changed.\n\n► Live Directions.

Plus, get real-time updates if/when there are changes to your favorite lines in case your bus time or train time is impacted!\n\n► Bike routes.

Moovit will help you plan a trip that meets your transit-needs. Bike docking stations are updated in real-time. Bike trip plans are only available in supported metro areas.\n\n► Maps view.

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

Adding a space you think others would find helpful is easy.

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

      "label": "Dublin Cycling Buddy (DCB) helps make your cycle rides around Dublin safer and more enjoyable!  Built using a new community-powered cycling navigation engine, the app will find safe, bike-friendly routes for your commuting and recreational rides. The app's voice turn-by-turn navigation will then guide you along the routes, alerting you about possible dangers along the route. It utilises large data sets, including GPS trajectories and crowdsourced issue reports, with a data engine that analyses the collected data to produce these optimised routes.\n\nThe solution will give cyclists peace of mind when planning their commutes, knowing full well that they are getting the best selection of cycling-optimized routes available. This will help both inexperienced cyclists to choose the safest routes possible while allowing the more experienced cyclists to choose an optimized route with a travel-time and bike-friendliness trade-off that best suits their preferences.\n\nAdditionally, the collection of data from cycling routes will help the city council’s planning department determine which ‘non official’ routes that cyclists are organically taking, in order to improve cycling infrastructure in these key locations.\n\nAfter an extensive Beta phase, this full release has taken into account lots of the feedback as reported by you.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using it as much as we had preparing it. And we always welcome more comments. Happy cycling!\n\nAs one of the data sources, Dublin Cycling Buddy uses OpenStreetMap maps, a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world based on the Open Database License.\n\nRoutes have information purposes only. Due to road works, current traffic, weather, and other events the real conditions on the route can differ from those suggested by the application. Use your judgment, be careful and follow road signs and other warnings. It is completely your responsibility that you follow traffic rules and ride safe."

On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

You can then tap to view street view, share or get directions (via Apple Maps or iMaps+).\n\nAlternatively, drag the yellow peg man from the top left hand corner of the map and release over a road or path to access street view.\n\nStreet view supports zooming in and out, and showing a mini-map overlay. There is also a full screen mode for a more immersive experience.\n\nIf you need a more complete Google Maps experience, look for \"iMaps+ for Google Maps\" on the App Store. iMaps+ provides all the great functionality from iStreets with the addition of directions, traffic, contacts integration and more.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nSubscriptions: iStreets operates as a subscription service. Recurring purchase is required for full functionality. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed, and auto-renewal may be turned off, from iStreets settings or the Apple Settings app. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited if you change your subscription term.\n\nDirections, street view and live traffic details are only available in certain geographical regions.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nTerms of Service: http://apptility.co.uk/imaps_tos.html\n\nApptility Limited is not related to, or affiliated with, Google, Inc.

There are differences between the app predictions and the official Hydro office tide tables, as these are based on large numbers of constants that are not made publicly available.  The Hydro offices consider the harmonic methods used in this product appropriate for navigation.\n\nAlways consult tidal curves and take into account local weather (pressure and wind) and swell conditions, which can have a very significant effect on sea water levels."

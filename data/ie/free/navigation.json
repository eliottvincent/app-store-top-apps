      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here. Honestly, these guys should be in charge of actual public transportation itself.\"\n\nCITIES\nTransit works in 200+ cities across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand (see USA list below).\n\nUSA\nAlbuquerque \nAnn Arbor\nAspen\nAtlanta*\nAustin*\nBaltimore (MTA*, RTA, Charm City Circulator*)\nBoston (MBTA*, Massport, MetroWest RTA, Brockton Area Transit (BAT), Lowell RTA, Plymouth & Brockton S.

      "label": "Aplikacja mBDL (mobilny Bank Danych o Lasach) umożliwia bezpośredni dostęp do map lasów na telefonach i tabletach. Podstawową zawartością aplikacji są leśne mapy tematyczne BDL, takie jak: mapa podstawowa, drzewostanowa, form własności, siedlisk leśnych, zbiorowisk roślinnych oraz mapa łowiecka. Poza mapami branżowymi, użytkownik ma możliwość wyświetlenia predefiniowanych podkładów rastrowych, np. mapy topograficznej lub ortofotomapy lotniczej/satelitarnej, a także map z zewnętrznych serwisów WMS. Adresy najpopularniejszych serwisów, np. dane o charakterze katastralnym, ortofotomapa czy serwis GDOŚ, są zapisane w aplikacji na stałe, co ułatwia ich wykorzystanie. Inne, dowolne serwisy WMS można podłączyć wpisując konkretny adres URL, który jest następnie zapamiętywany w aplikacji.\nPo wcześniejszym pobraniu odpowiednich danych, aplikacja działa również w sytuacji braku łączności z siecią Internet. Mechanizm pobierania danych do pracy offline umożliwia korzystanie z map nadleśnictw oraz parków narodowychRazem z mapami, które zapisywane są w postaci rastrowej, dla lasów PGL LP pobierane są dane wektorowe z atrybutami opisowymi.\nZ poziomu aplikacji mBDL użytkownik ma dostęp w trybie online do pełnego opisu taksacyjnego dla lasów wszystkich form własności. Opis taki zawiera m.in. gatunki drzew i krzewów występujące w danym miejscu, ich szczegółowy opis, adres leśny, wskazania gospodarcze i wiele innych informacji. \nAplikacja wyposażona jest dodatkowo w szereg przydatnych w terenie funkcjonalności: zapis punktu z lokalizacji GPS lub ze wskazania na mapie, zapis trasy oraz prostą nawigację do wskazanego punktu. Zapisane punkty i trasy można wyeksportować w postaci pliku KML, wysłać w świat w dowolny sposób lub zaimportować na innym urządzeniu, na którym też jest zainstalowana aplikacja mBDL.\nW mBDL można wyszukać wydzielenia leśne na podstawie tzw. adresu leśnego. Narzędzie to działa podobnie jak wyszukiwanie w portalu internetowym. \nW menu Pomoc dostępna jest również instrukcja opisująca podstawowe funkcjonalności, z którą warto się zapoznać na początku użytkowania aplikacji. \nDeklaracja dostępności: https://www.bdl.lasy.gov.pl/portal/deklaracja-mbdl."

      "label": "Dublin Cycling Buddy (DCB) helps make your cycle rides around Dublin safer and more enjoyable!  Built using a new community-powered cycling navigation engine, the app will find safe, bike-friendly routes for your commuting and recreational rides. The app's voice turn-by-turn navigation will then guide you along the routes, alerting you about possible dangers along the route. It utilises large data sets, including GPS trajectories and crowdsourced issue reports, with a data engine that analyses the collected data to produce these optimised routes.\n\nThe solution will give cyclists peace of mind when planning their commutes, knowing full well that they are getting the best selection of cycling-optimized routes available. This will help both inexperienced cyclists to choose the safest routes possible while allowing the more experienced cyclists to choose an optimized route with a travel-time and bike-friendliness trade-off that best suits their preferences.\n\nAdditionally, the collection of data from cycling routes will help the city council’s planning department determine which ‘non official’ routes that cyclists are organically taking, in order to improve cycling infrastructure in these key locations.\n\nAfter an extensive Beta phase, this full release has taken into account lots of the feedback as reported by you.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using it as much as we had preparing it. And we always welcome more comments. Happy cycling!\n\nAs one of the data sources, Dublin Cycling Buddy uses OpenStreetMap maps, a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world based on the Open Database License.\n\nRoutes have information purposes only. Due to road works, current traffic, weather, and other events the real conditions on the route can differ from those suggested by the application. Use your judgment, be careful and follow road signs and other warnings. It is completely your responsibility that you follow traffic rules and ride safe."

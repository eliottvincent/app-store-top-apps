When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the same cost as your original purchase.\n\n\nTIPS FOR MAPPING ROUTES\n• For longer routes, try zooming in and mapping your route in multiple segments.\n• Tap and hold the map to quickly route between waypoints and POIs.\n• Did Footpath snap to the wrong roads? Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

GET ACCURATE DIRECTIONS\nEnter an address or Eircode and ​use any navigation app on your phone (e.g. Google Maps, Apple Maps, TomTom, etc.) to get accurate directions direct to the front door.\n\n2. DELIVERY DRIVER FEATURES\nSave your deliveries in the app! You can store contact phone numbers and other useful information. The app optimises your route by automatically arranging your deliveries in the most efficient order. You can record your successful delivery (or if you were unable to deliver) saving the time of day and distance from the delivery location for verification.\n\n3. HAVE AN ADDRESS THAT SAT-NAV'S SEND TO THE WRONG STREET/ENTRANCE?\nAn Eircode provides the precise coordinate for an address, but sometimes navigation apps can choose the wrong street or wrong entrance to navigate to the building. That little error can send ​you up to hundreds of metres away from the right location. Let us know by sending us the Eircode and we'll ensure the correct access location is always used​ for directions to that Eircode via our app. Problem solved instantly, no waiting months for the underlying map data to be updated in every navigation app.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy downloading and using this application you confirm that you accept our  Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are available from our website. \n\nFor complete terms and conditions, please visit https://www.autoaddress.ie/terms-of-use\nFor privacy policy, please visit https://www.autoaddress.ie/privacy-statement"

We hope our work helps to inspire you and others to take better care of our planet and to stop using so much single use plastic.\n\n\nRefill Ireland started in 2017 as an environmental project aiming to make towns and cities tap water Refill friendly for everyone while on the go (like the good old days!).\n\nWe locate and encourage the creation of locations where filling your reusable water bottle for FREE from an increasing number of Refill stations becomes an easy to do everyday habit, helping hydration and ultimately protecting our environment from bottle waste.

      "label": "The Nearest Defib App allows users to pinpoint the location of publically accessible Automated External Defibrillators (AED) closest to their current location based on a users smartphone GPS feature.\n\nThe Cause of Sudden Cardiac Arrest\n\nSudden Cardiac Arrest is often misunderstood as a heart attack. A heart attack is a plumbing problem where the heart is blocked, causing heart muscle to die.\nheart\n\nSudden Cardiac Arrest occurs when the heart's electrical system malfunctions; causing rhythms that is rapid (ventricular tachycardia) or chaotic (ventricular fibrillation) or both. This irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia) causes the heart to suddenly stop beating in any coordinated manner. The heart muscle quivers or fibrillates rather than pump blood. \n\nVital organs are immediately deprived of oxygen, causing the victim to collapse. Brain death and irreversible damage begin in four to six minutes after someone experiences cardiac arrest.\n\nWhile heart attack victims typically experience symptoms prior to an emergency, around 50% of sudden cardiac deaths occur without prior signs or symptoms. Commonly the signs of a Sudden Cardiac Arrest are only apparent at the moment of a full on emergency. Those signs include:\n\n    Sudden collapse\n    Loss of consciousness\n    No breathing\n    Loss of pulse\n    No sign of life\n\nUnfortunately even with a 10-12 minute ambulance response time, the best chance for survival lies in a bystander’s recognition of the signs, the availability of an AED nearby. Acting quickly the use of an AED by responders at the scene could terminate the chaotic ventricular rhythms and allow the heart to restore itself to a normal pulse.\n\nBecause more than 80% of Sudden Cardiac Arrests happen in homes or public places, outside of a hospital setting, victims are caught out of reach of a rapid defibrillation that is unless you have an AED.\n\nThe Chain of Survival\n    Early Access: Recognise an emergency and call 000 immediately.\n    Early CPR: Begin Cardiopulmonary Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) immediately\n    Early Defibrillation: Use the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) ASAP\n    Early Advanced Care: Transfer to the paramedics Care.\n\nThe Chain of Survival is only as strong as its’ weakest link and unfortunately, Early Defibrillation is not the strongest link.\n\nWhile CPR can extend the window of opportunity for responders to arrive and defibrillate the heart, the true solution is in deployment of AEDs and empowering bystanders to be the hero. A recent AED program deployed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground has resulted in an 80% survival rate.  Reducing the time to defibrillation through widespread access of AEDs is the only way to reduce our dismal survival rate."

It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

      "label": "Dublin Cycling Buddy (DCB) helps make your cycle rides around Dublin safer and more enjoyable!  Built using a new community-powered cycling navigation engine, the app will find safe, bike-friendly routes for your commuting and recreational rides. The app's voice turn-by-turn navigation will then guide you along the routes, alerting you about possible dangers along the route. It utilises large data sets, including GPS trajectories and crowdsourced issue reports, with a data engine that analyses the collected data to produce these optimised routes.\n\nThe solution will give cyclists peace of mind when planning their commutes, knowing full well that they are getting the best selection of cycling-optimized routes available. This will help both inexperienced cyclists to choose the safest routes possible while allowing the more experienced cyclists to choose an optimized route with a travel-time and bike-friendliness trade-off that best suits their preferences.\n\nAdditionally, the collection of data from cycling routes will help the city council’s planning department determine which ‘non official’ routes that cyclists are organically taking, in order to improve cycling infrastructure in these key locations.\n\nAfter an extensive Beta phase, this full release has taken into account lots of the feedback as reported by you.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using it as much as we had preparing it. And we always welcome more comments. Happy cycling!\n\nAs one of the data sources, Dublin Cycling Buddy uses OpenStreetMap maps, a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world based on the Open Database License.\n\nRoutes have information purposes only. Due to road works, current traffic, weather, and other events the real conditions on the route can differ from those suggested by the application. Use your judgment, be careful and follow road signs and other warnings. It is completely your responsibility that you follow traffic rules and ride safe."

This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

Emergency services use a range of other information channels including SKY TV, ABC local radio, some commercial and designated community radio stations, VicEmergency Hotline  on 1800 226 226, VicEmergency website on www.emergency.vic.gov.au and VicEmergency Twitter and Facebook.\n\nAre you getting a message asking you to turn on notifications? You need to ensure that push notifications are enabled specifically for the VicEmergency app, as follows:\n\nFor iOS10, iOS9, iOS8 and iOS6:\n1. Click on the Settings icon and then select Notifications. \n2. Scroll down, click the VicEmergency icon\n3. Ensure 'Allow Notifications\" or \"Notification Centre\" (iOS6) at top of the screen is set to On. \n4. We recommend that you set Alert Style as 'Banners' or Alerts' and ensure that Sounds and \"Show on Lock Screen\" or \"View in Lock Screen\" (iOS6) are set to On. \n\nFor iOS7: \n1. Open the device's Settings icon and then select 'Notification Center'.\n2. Under 'Access on Lock Screen', check that 'Notifications View' is On (showing as green).\n3. Scroll further down and ensure that VicEmergency is in the list under INCLUDE. Click it to open it.\n4. At the top, set Alert Style as 'Banners' or Alerts'\n5. Then ensure that everything in this section is turned On - ‘Badge App Icon’, ‘Sounds’, 'Show in Notification Center', 'Show on Lock Screen’, etc (all should be showing as green)."

      "label": "Castro is a beautiful, full-featured podcast player that makes it easy to track and manage lots of podcasts at the same time. Only listen to the episodes you want and easily skip the rest, queue up hours of podcasts at a time and enjoy a seamless listening experience with carplay compatibility, chapter support, trim silence and much, much more!\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n1. New episodes land in the NEW tab. Read their descriptions, add episodes you like to your QUEUE, and clear the rest. \n\n2. Press play to listen to episodes from your QUEUE in order. Queued episodes are downloaded automatically.\n\n3. Re-order your QUEUE to plan your next few hours of listening at any time. Browse your LIBRARY to review the back catalogue, quickly access starred shows, and see your listening history.\n\nSubscribing to a podcast is no longer a commitment to listen to every episode. You don’t have to manage a huge list of subscriptions or choose a few shows and miss the rest.\n\n\nWHY OUR USERS LOVE CASTRO\n\n• Drag and drop podcasts to plan your listening with Castro’s unique queue\n• An elegant dark mode and thoughtfully designed sleep timer offer the best in night time podcast listening.\n• CarPlay support makes it easy to pick up where you left off while driving.\n• Apple Watch app to control playback and select another episode from your queue.\n• Episode notifications include a summary of the episode to help you decide if it interests you. Play, queue or clear the episode directly from the notification without opening the app.\n\n\nCASTRO PLUS\n\nCastro Plus is an optional paid subscription available for $18.99/year (includes a one-week trial). Plus unlocks a range of advanced features:\n\n• Trim Silence — With this option on, the app will analyze audio as it plays to detect silent parts and accelerate those parts. Get through more episodes faster.\n• Enhance Voices improves the listening experience for many podcasts and makes it easier to hear in loud environments. Under the hood, Enhance Voices applies a dynamic compressor to increase volume just where it’s needed.\n• Sideloading: Import audio files directly, just by dropping them in iCloud Drive\n• Mono-Mix — Mixes a stereo podcast to mono, which makes it easier to hear podcasts that pan some guests on left/right channels. \n• Chapter Support: Artwork, Skipping & Pre-selection. \n• Custom settings per-podcast: Episode Limit, Trim Silence, Enhance Voices, Mono Mix, Skip Intros, Playback Speed.\n\n\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING\n\n“Castro 3 is an incredible app.”\n— The Sweet Setup\n\n“Castro 3 is everything Castro already was, but better.”\n— MacStories\n\nCastro 3 Is a Great Modern Podcast App”\n— Beautiful Pixels\n\n“Unlike other podcatchers, Castro's primary virtue is its simplicity and ease of use. The app combines sleek visual design with crystal clear audio.” \n— Tom’s Guide\n\n\nCASTRO PLUS SUBSCRIPTION TERMS\n\nCastro Plus costs $18.99 per year. Prices are in US dollars and may vary in countries other than the US.\n\nCastro Plus is charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. It will renew on the day before the current subscription period ends. You can cancel auto-renewal any time from the Castro settings screen.\n\nYou can switch between the two subscription periods after you pick one, but your trial period will end immediately if you do, so it's best to wait till your free week is over before changing.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nPrivacy Policy & Terms of Use: https://castro.fm/privacy-policy"

Застосунок не потребує реєстрації, не збирає персональні дані або дані про геолокацію.\n\nУ застосунку доступні всі області України, а також додано можливість отримувати тривоги лише за обраним районом чи територіальною громадою.\n\nЯк працює застосунок: \n\n1. Оператор обласної державної адміністрації отримує сигнал про повітряну тривогу.\n2. Оператор негайно передає інформацію на пульт.\n3. Застосунок надсилає тривожне сповіщення користувачам, які обрали відповідну область.\n4. Щойно оператор надсилає сигнал про відбій тривоги, користувачі застосунку отримують відповідне сповіщення.\n\nЦе єдиний застосунок, що підтримує критичні сповіщення. Це означає, що звук тривоги буде завжди надходити з максимальним рівнем гучності смартфону. Для цього надайте усі відповідні дозволи застосунку після встановлення. Важливо! Критичні сповіщення можна вимкнути в будь-який момент в налаштуваннях застосунку.\n\nБережіть себе та рідних. \n\n** Застосунок створено за підтримки Міністерства цифрової трансформації України.

      "label": "Noa brings you the world’s best journalism, curated by editors and read aloud by professional voice actors. We aim to provide multiple perspectives on trending news topics, through a highly involved curation process where Noa’s editors hand-pick the very best articles from the world's best publishers.\n\nIn a world with polarised opinions and ideology-driven media coverage, are you seeking multiple viewpoints? Start listening to Noa to save you time in exploring varying perspectives and to help you stay informed on the topics everyone is talking about.\n\nIt integrates easily into your daily or weekly routine. Listen while exercising, driving, cooking, or walking.\n\nTOP PUBLISHERS. ONE APP\nOur partnering publishers include\n\n• The Economist\n• Harvard Business Review\n• The Washington Post\n• The Telegraph\n• Bloomberg\n• The New York Times\n• Fast Company\n• Insider\n• MIT Technology Review\n• Foreign Affairs\n• The Independent\n• The Conversation\n• And more.\n\nOUR EDITORIAL PRINCIPLES\t\n1.

Thought-provoking: Present audio articles that inform, inspire, and offer fresh insights, through both a global and a national lens. Focus on opinion, feature, and analysis articles.\n3. Storytellers: Be storytellers and educators. Help our listeners understand global topics, and perspectives, while also telling the stories of the people behind the headlines.\n4.

Our goal is to help listeners navigate it. \n\nAUDIO STORIES\nListening to the best journalism is a great way to learn and grow, especially when you don’t have time to read. Audio articles are produced and recorded daily by Noa’s talented voice actors – Sam Scholl, Adrienne Walker, Peter Hanly, Martin Buchanan, Les Smith, Grainne Brookfield and Jessie McGee. They’re probably in the booth recording as you read this!\n\nAUDIO SERIES\nEach day, Noa’s editor’s select the very best audio articles and add them to topic-specific playlists. Every Series begins with a short explainer – written by a Noa editor – that provides valuable context on the subject at hand before you dive in. Within 20-30 minutes, you’ll walk away fully informed.\n\nAUDIO FEATURES\nAlong with the usual audio features, you’ll find: CarPlay, AirPlay, Offline Mode, Sleep Timer, Playback Speed Adjustment, an editable Article Queue, and Rewind and Fast-forward.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nWe know you expect more. That’s why the Noa app also offers:\n• In-app chat (we respond quickly)\n• My Stats to view your daily streak and listening stats\n• Save, Download, and Follow\n• Share – articles and Series\n• Read Along\n\nALWAYS FREE\nYou can listen to the free tier of Noa without any need to pay. You’ll get a weekly article allowance and access to most of our publishers.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES\nBy choosing to support Noa with a monthly or annual subscription you’ll get unlimited, ad-free access to over 18k audio articles (and counting) from the world’s best publishers, including our Premium-only publications. We would love to welcome you as a member of Noa’s growing community.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY\nWe’re real people, just like you and we take great care to protect your data. Noa does not share your data with others or allow advertisers to track you. Your data is used solely for the purpose of providing you with the best news, learning, and listening experience possible.\n\nPrivacy: https://www.newsoveraudio.com/privacy\nTerms: https://www.newsoveraudio.com/terms"

      "label": "The largest collection of live police, firefighter, aircraft, railroad, emergency, news, and ham radios. Be the first to know about weather, news, and crime updates.\n\nThanks for making 5-0 Radio the most downloaded police scanner app on the market. This app is one of top 100 most downloaded iOS apps since 2009 with tens of millions of users.\n\nFeatures\n======\n- New “Feeds with Active Alerts” feature that shows you feeds with interesting on-going activity and breaking news happening right now along with a description of the alert, breaking info, location, and feed.\n- Listen to feeds in the background. You can run other apps while listening to the police. Pause the feeds via the media controls on your device.\n- Automatically attempts to reconnect the feed if you lose the connection.\n- Listen to feeds on your desktop/laptop computer. Email yourself a link to the feed, and open that link on your browser or with your favorite mp3 player.\n- Ability to add custom feeds\n- Chat with other users\n- The web browser also automatically detects feeds and integrates it with the radio. Now you can add feeds from the web by simply tapping on the feed's link via our browser.\n- Share feeds with your friends by email. They do not need to buy this app to listen with you. They can listen in with any device that has a web browser.\n- Worldwide coverage. Listen to feeds from the United States, Canada, Australia and more. Our app is always expanding and looking for new police radios to tap into.\n- List scanners by county. Don't just list all feeds in a state, get only the ones that are from your city/county.\n- Integrated map that finds your location and the location of the feed. Now you can find where the action is happening and follow along.\n- Built-in police/EMS/fire/military codes and phonetic alphabet for easy interpretation. Good for any beginners who do not have the proper training and have trouble remembering what the codes mean.\n- Save your favorites to the front screen of the app for quick one-tap access.\n- This app will dynamically grab a new list of sources so that you will always be the first to get any new police feeds out there.\n- See the popularity of each feed. Each feed lists the number of listeners who are following the action along with you.\n- Choose new skins or make your own. Skins can be any photo you choose from your photos library.\n- New police feeds and others are added on an hourly basis, so keep checking if we added yours recently.\n\nUpgrade to 5-0 Radio Pro to remove ads, add even more feeds, and new features.\n\nLegality\n======\nIt is legal in most countries to listen to police feeds. However, it is illegal in some places to use this app to aid in the commission of a crime or to pose as a police officer when you are not. It may also be illegal to use it while driving. Please consult your local laws before using this app outside of your home.\n\nIs it fake?\n=======\nIt's very real. Each feed comes from a person in that region with an expensive police scanner sharing the signal with you via the internet.\n\nReal-time\n=======\nThe delay between the real radio feed and this app is only a few seconds depending on buffering and internet speeds.\n\nRecommendations\n==============\nCheck out our website SmartestApple.com for other great free apps from us"

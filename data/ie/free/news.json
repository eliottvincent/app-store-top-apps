      "label": "Disaster Alert is a free mobile app for public use that provides the global community with critical hazard alerts and information needed to stay safe anywhere in the world. Built on PDC’s DisasterAWARE® platform, Disaster Alert™ offers near real-time updates about 18 different types of natural hazards as they are unfolding around the globe.\n\nWith Disaster Alert, you can customize early warning alerts, view estimated impact reports, and access visualized modeled hazard data. Disaster Alert’s continuous stream of new information is automatically generated from the most reliable, scientifically verified sources. When no official source is available, alerts are updated manually by Pacific Disaster Center, presenting only a small lapse of time between the time of an event and the availability of information in the system.\n\nHazard updates provided with Disaster Alert include only active hazards. “Active Hazards” are part of a collection of recent incidents that have been designated as potentially hazardous to people, property, or assets by PDC.\n\nINCLUDED HAZARD TYPES\n\n*Automatically processed in near real time:Hurricanes (tropical cyclones / typhoons), earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanos, floods, wildfires, U.S. tornados and winter storms.\n\n*Manually Processed: Marine hazards, storms, droughts, and manmade incidents. High surf advisories, high winds, and flash floods are available for Hawaii only.\n\nNEW IN VERSION 7.1.9\n\n*New Fixed Menu: DisasterAlert now features a fixed menu bar at the bottom of the screen. When a menu item is selected, users can adjust the size of the menu by dragging it upwards to a fully open state, dragging down for fully closed, or dragging partway to 40% of the screen.\n\n*New Action Menu: The action menu, represented by three dots at the bottom of each menu panel […], has been relocated to the top right corner of each menu panel. When selected, the action menu will load additional options.\n\n*New Hazards Symbology: Hazard icons, color coding, and shapes have been updated. Colors now represent hazard severity, with red being the most severe and blue being the least. Please refer to the DisasterAWARE 7.0 User Guide for additional details.\n\n*New Themes: There is a new theme that integrates DisasterAWARE branding, colors, and iconography. Additional themes have been created including a Dark mode and Light mode.\n \nOTHER KEY FEATURES\n\n*Customizable alerts based on your geographic area of interest and hazard severity\n*When the map tip is activated by selecting a hazard on the map, users can get estimated impact information by choosing the \"Info\" link and viewing Hazard Brief.  \n* Interactive map interface displays 18 different types of active hazards\n*Customizable background maps\n*Map layers with overlays for population densities, global cloud coverage, and more."

      "label": "Castro is a beautiful, full-featured podcast player that makes it easy to track and manage lots of podcasts at the same time. Only listen to the episodes you want and easily skip the rest, queue up hours of podcasts at a time and enjoy a seamless listening experience with carplay compatibility, chapter support, trim silence and much, much more!\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n1. New episodes land in the NEW tab. Read their descriptions, add episodes you like to your QUEUE, and clear the rest. \n\n2. Press play to listen to episodes from your QUEUE in order. Queued episodes are downloaded automatically.\n\n3. Re-order your QUEUE to plan your next few hours of listening at any time. Browse your LIBRARY to review the back catalogue, quickly access starred shows, and see your listening history.\n\nSubscribing to a podcast is no longer a commitment to listen to every episode. You don’t have to manage a huge list of subscriptions or choose a few shows and miss the rest.\n\n\nWHY OUR USERS LOVE CASTRO\n\n• Drag and drop podcasts to plan your listening with Castro’s unique queue\n• An elegant dark mode and thoughtfully designed sleep timer offer the best in night time podcast listening.\n• CarPlay support makes it easy to pick up where you left off while driving.\n• Apple Watch app to control playback and select another episode from your queue.\n• Episode notifications include a summary of the episode to help you decide if it interests you. Play, queue or clear the episode directly from the notification without opening the app.\n\n\nCASTRO PLUS\n\nCastro Plus is an optional paid subscription available for $18.99/year (includes a one-week trial). Plus unlocks a range of advanced features:\n\n• Trim Silence — With this option on, the app will analyze audio as it plays to detect silent parts and accelerate those parts. Get through more episodes faster.\n• Enhance Voices improves the listening experience for many podcasts and makes it easier to hear in loud environments. Under the hood, Enhance Voices applies a dynamic compressor to increase volume just where it’s needed.\n• Sideloading: Import audio files directly, just by dropping them in iCloud Drive\n• Mono-Mix — Mixes a stereo podcast to mono, which makes it easier to hear podcasts that pan some guests on left/right channels. \n• Chapter Support: Artwork, Skipping & Pre-selection. \n• Custom settings per-podcast: Episode Limit, Trim Silence, Enhance Voices, Mono Mix, Skip Intros, Playback Speed.\n\n\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING\n\n“Castro 3 is an incredible app.”\n— The Sweet Setup\n\n“Castro 3 is everything Castro already was, but better.”\n— MacStories\n\nCastro 3 Is a Great Modern Podcast App”\n— Beautiful Pixels\n\n“Unlike other podcatchers, Castro's primary virtue is its simplicity and ease of use. The app combines sleek visual design with crystal clear audio.” \n— Tom’s Guide\n\n\nCASTRO PLUS SUBSCRIPTION TERMS\n\nCastro Plus costs $18.99 per year. Prices are in US dollars and may vary in countries other than the US.\n\nCastro Plus is charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. It will renew on the day before the current subscription period ends. You can cancel auto-renewal any time from the Castro settings screen.\n\nYou can switch between the two subscription periods after you pick one, but your trial period will end immediately if you do, so it's best to wait till your free week is over before changing.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nPrivacy Policy & Terms of Use: https://castro.fm/privacy-policy"

This feature sends an alert for breaking news within a few kilometres of your current location – just allow access to your location when prompted. This can be especially useful for alerts about traffic delays or accidents, fires, floods, and police operations.\n \nWe understand that too many alerts can be intrusive, so our team will only send ones we think you will find truly interesting. Our alerts are sent without an audible tone so you won't be disturbed at the wrong time.\n \nThe 9NEWS app also allows you to set your location by city or postcode so you see extra stories from your state and weather forecasts for exactly where you live.\n \nIf you feel you're getting too many alerts, or too few, you can easily change your subscriptions within the app on the Settings screen.\n \nHave questions or feedback on the 9NEWS app? Email contact@9news.com.au to let us know.\n\nPlease note: This app features Nielsen's proprietary measurement software which will allow you to contribute to market research or audience ratings services. Please see www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy for more information."

Застосунок не потребує реєстрації, не збирає персональні дані або дані про геолокацію.\n\nУ застосунку доступні всі області України, а також додано можливість отримувати тривоги лише за обраним районом чи територіальною громадою.\n\nЯк працює застосунок: \n\n1. Оператор обласної державної адміністрації отримує сигнал про повітряну тривогу.\n2. Оператор негайно передає інформацію на пульт.\n3. Застосунок надсилає тривожне сповіщення користувачам, які обрали відповідну область.\n4. Щойно оператор надсилає сигнал про відбій тривоги, користувачі застосунку отримують відповідне сповіщення.\n\nЦе єдиний застосунок, що підтримує критичні сповіщення. Це означає, що звук тривоги буде завжди надходити з максимальним рівнем гучності смартфону. Для цього надайте усі відповідні дозволи застосунку після встановлення. Важливо! Критичні сповіщення можна вимкнути в будь-який момент в налаштуваннях застосунку.\n\nБережіть себе та рідних. \n\n** Застосунок створено за підтримки Міністерства цифрової трансформації України.

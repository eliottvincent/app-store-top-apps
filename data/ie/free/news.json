Застосунок надсилає тривожне сповіщення користувачам, які обрали відповідну область.\n4.

Критичні сповіщення можна вимкнути в будь-який момент в налаштуваннях застосунку.\n\nБережіть себе та рідних. \n\n** Застосунок створено за підтримки Міністерства цифрової трансформації України.

Ви отримаєте з додатку звуковий сигнал сирени, коли у вашому місті або області буде оголошена повітряна тривога. \n\nДодаток зробленний українськими IT-волонтерами у Польщі. Додаток немає ніякого відношення до Дії та Мінцифри України. Ми надіємось, вони з нами сконтактуються. Зі своєї сторони ми вже це зробили. \n\nСлідкуйте за нами у Twitter, Facebook та Instagram  – @eTryvoga\n\nOur app is designed to notify civilian population of Ukraine of any new or ongoing air-strike alarms in their area. This app could help prevent injuries and prevent absolutely unnecessary deaths in situations where people cannot hear the sirens. This app is wholly humanitarian in nature and we have contacted the Ukrainian government and are in the process of negotiating other ways in which we could help the country in its dire need of support."

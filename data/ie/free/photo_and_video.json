      "label": "Watch any web video and your personal photos, videos & music on your Chromecast or Google Cast powered TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen. \n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> UPGRADE FEATURES (available as in-app purchases)\n\n* Premium Edition: Unlocks all of the features listed here. Also future features are included, so you do not have to pay for them when they are released in an updated app version. \n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker: Blocks ads & popups on most websites and removes the sponsoring ads from the app. You can update and enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!! And you designed it work easily and quickly\"\nRyan, England\n\n“I looooove your app. It has taken my Chromecast to a whole new level.”\nRosalind Romero, USA\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

      "label": "Tired of being photobombed? Thinking about getting rid of some imperfections in the background of the photo but don’t know how? Need to erase unwanted objects from your pictures to get them just right? All these annoying things shouldn’t be a problem anymore with our AI-driven photo editor. RetouchAI is that magic button that will help you easily transform poorly taken photos into the ones you actually deserve.\n\n\nUser-friendly interface, comprehensible functionality, the capability to remove imperfections in “one-click” are features that RetouchAI offers for you, specifically:\n\n\n• People auto-detection\n\nRetouchAI offers you highly convenient tools to identify strangers and crowd. The editor will precisely auto-detect the borders and highlight them for further auto removal. You just need to single them out in one tap\n\n\n• Imperfections removal\n• Lines removal\n• Blemish removal\n\nThe app declutters photo imperfections and retouches them in an extremely simplified, yet smart way. The editor makes sure that the chosen area is erased without the photo distortion and is repaired appropriately.\n\n• Multiple retouch algorithms\n\nOnce you select a particular area in your photo that needs to be restored, the app will offer you multiple variants. You may choose the one that looks the most natural and will be the best fit.\n\n\n• Background edit\n\nWith the RetouchAI photo editor background replacement feature, you can cut out the existing background of your photo easily and replace it with one of the templates from the gallery. In case you don’t want to change the background, the app provides you with the convenient functionality to blur the background to the required extent. \n\n\n• Efficient clone stamp tool\n\nWhen you erase certain objects from the photo, the editor needs to restore the marked area with correctly chosen colors. This is done via the clone stamp tool that uses the surrounding area as a context to restore the photo precisely.\n\n\n• Teeth whitening\n\nThe tool allows you to whiten your teeth and make your smile even more fabulous than it is now. Everything is simple: select the necessary area, adjust the intensity of the brush, and boom, everything is ready. Explore a natural teeth whitening feature now. \n\n\n• Stretching\n\nAllows you to modify the selected area both vertically and horizontally. It's no longer a problem to increase your height, enlarge your hips, or adjust anything else. You just need to choose the place you need to stretch and modify it to the extent you want.\n\n• Helpful tooltips & friendly support\n\nDespite being rather intuitively obvious, the app has numerous embedded tooltips that pop up once you start using the photo editor. All the tooltips were designed to make your photo editing process seamless and pleasant so that you say goodbye to sophisticated interfaces, confusing buttons, and annoying welcome tutorials.\n\n\nDownload RetouchAI and make your photos great again. Enjoy!\n\n\nDon’t forget to check our privacy policy and terms of service:\n\nhttp://retouch-ai.com/privacy-policy.html\nhttp://retouch-ai.com/terms-of-service.html\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n\n• Subscription for Retouch AI for full access to all features.\n\n• Subscription length: one week, one month, 12 months and lifetime.\n\n• Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account as soon as you confirm your purchase.\n\n• You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal from your Account Settings after the purchase.\n\n• Your subscription will renew automatically, unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\n• The cost of renewal will be charged to your account in the 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n\n• When canceling a subscription, your subscription will stay active until the end of the period.

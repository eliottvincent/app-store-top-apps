      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance.  \n\nThis set of widgets can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define.  For example, a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your work day, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day.  This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\nActivity widgets require a paired Apple Watch\n\nThe app itself also includes a wide collection of tools, such as a weather app, a timezone converter, a calendar.  These tools can automatically launch based on the active widget tapped.\n\nNotes:\n • Widgetsmith optionally integrates with Apple Health.

As you work hard, the seed will grow into a healthy tree. Let the tree be your coach and grow yourself with it. You will be amazed by how great you can be.\n\nFOCUS TREES\n\nHave trouble putting down the phone? Flora blocks distracting apps in a pleasant way to help you focus on what’s more important in real life. If you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app while growing a tree, the tree will be killed! But if succeeding, you'll unlock new trees.\n\nDOUBLE EFFICIENCY WITH FRIENDS \n\nThings get even more interesting when you challenge your friends to plant trees together—you will see who kills a tree (ouch). However, if you successfully stay away from your phones together, each of you will win an additional tree from a random friend. You can also chat and share your progress to motivate each other and keep everyone on track.*\n\n* Flora is the original app for multi-user tree planting and delivers the best features that help you and your friends be productive. \n\nTO-DO LIST & WIDGET\n\nFlora is a to-do list, and more. Simply create a to-do item and set a reminder, then you will never forget a thing. Even better, you can tag your trees with a to-do item to easily track the progress towards each of your life goals.

      "label": "myGovID is the Australian Government’s digital identity app that allows you to prove who you are and sign in to participating government online services.\n\nThe myGovID app is different to myGov. You can use the myGovID app to sign in to your myGov account.\n\nSet up your myGovID in three easy steps:\n1. Download the myGovID app\n2. Enter your details – including your full name, date of birth and a personal email address that only you have access to.\n3. Verify your identity to increase your identity strength. There are three identity strengths – Basic, Standard or Strong. Increasing your identity strengths allows you to access more services and better protects your identity.\nIncrease your identity strength by verifying your Australian identity documents, like your passport, driver’s licence and Medicare card. These documents are checked against existing government records. You can also choose to verify you photo, this is a one-off face verification check, to further increase your identity strength. The app scans your face to check that you’re a real person, the right person and verifying in real time.\nYou need to be 15 years or older to set up a myGovID. However, age restrictions may also apply to use some government online services. To find out if you’re eligible to use a particular service, check its terms of use.\nYour personal information won’t be shared without your permission - putting you in control. myGovID is accredited under the Australian Trusted Digital Identity Framework which strictly controls how your identity data is collected, stored and used. It uses encryption technology as well as the security features in your device, such as fingerprint, face and password. This is to protect your identity and help prevent other people accessing your information.\n\nYour myGovID is unique to you – don’t share it with others.\n\nIf you need help or more information visit www.myGovID.gov.au"

Used by millions worldwide, our all-new email app protects your communications and has everything you need to easily manage your inbox.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says:\n“Proton Mail offers encrypted email, which makes it virtually impossible for anyone to read it except the sender and the recipient.”\n\nWith the all-new Proton Mail app, you can:\n• Create a @proton.me or @protonmail.com email address \n• Send and receive encrypted emails and attachments with ease\n• Switch between multiple Proton Mail accounts\n• Easily manage your email with conversations\n• Keep your inbox tidy and clean with folders, labels and simple swipe-gestures\n• Receive new email notifications\n• Send Password-protected Emails to anyone\n• Enjoy your inbox in dark mode\n\nWhy use Proton Mail?\n• Proton Mail is free — We believe everyone deserves privacy. Upgrade to a paid plan to get more done and support our mission. \n• Easy to use — Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to read, organize, and write your emails.\n• Your inbox is yours — We don’t spy on your communications to show you targeted ads. Your inbox, your rules.\n• Rigorous encryption — Your entire inbox is secured, on all your devices. No one can read your emails but you. Proton is privacy, guaranteed by end-to-end and zero-access encryption.\n• Unmatched protection — We offer strong phishing, spam, and spying/tracking protection for all your communications.\n\nIndustry Leading Security Features\nMessages are stored on Proton Mail servers using end-to-end encryption at all times and are transmitted securely between Proton servers and user devices. This largely eliminates the risk of message interception.\n\nZero Access to Your Email Content\nProton Mail's zero access architecture means that your data is encrypted in a way that makes it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side using an encryption key that Proton does not have access to.

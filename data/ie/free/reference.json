      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App & #1 Prayer App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

      "label": "Give up technology? Take cold showers? Abstain from alcohol? \n\nAll around the world, thousands of men find themselves trapped in negative, habitual thought patterns and behaviors. You know what we're talking about: endless scrolling through useless noise, unending binges of shows you stopped caring about three seasons ago, two-three-four-five drinks per night celebrating nothing in particular. We live for the weekends and then waste them away.\n\nSurely, we were made for more than this.\n\nExodus 90 is an introduction to a different kind of life: a life of responsibility and meaning and freedom. Freedom from our vices and freedom to live a life for others: our families, friends, and communities. Exodus 90 calls you to follow a disciplined life of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity. For ninety days, you will say goodbye to creature comforts and find new life in Christ. You'll enter into silent prayer each day. And you'll undertake this journey with a band of brothers to provide encouragement (and accountability) along the way.\n\nAfter 90 days of prayerful meditation in Exodus 90, you and your fraternity will continue your journey of prayer, asceticism, and fraternity through the liturgical seasons of the year, starting with the Easter Season and continuing through the Summer & Fall. The 90 days of Exodus aren't a finish line--they're a new beginning. It's not about living different for 90 days. It's about living different after Day 91. The NEW Exodus Seasons offer daily readings and action plans to help you build and sustain a new life in Christ.\n\nWhy Exodus 90 & The Exodus Seasons?\n\n• Exodus is effective. More than 99% of men who complete Exodus 90 report being more free from unhealthy attachments.\n\n• Exodus increases men's faith satisfaction, helps them spend 46% more time in prayer and increases their participation at church.\n\nThe first 7 days of Exodus 90 and The Exodus Seasons are completely free to new men. On Day 8 of your first spiritual journey, you'll be invited to join Exodus+.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/8280995/full-legal\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

      "label": "Unleash the power of your smartphone to take you on a guided tour of the night sky, even if you’ve never used a telescope before.\n\nSTARSENSE SKY RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY\n\nThis one-of-a-kind app uses patent-pending technology in combination with a Celestron StarSense Explorer telescope (sold separately) to analyze star patterns overhead to calculate the telescope’s position in real time with pinpoint accuracy.\nStarSense Explorer’s sky recognition technology has revolutionized the manual telescope by eliminating the confusion common among beginners and enhancing the user experience for even seasoned telescope users. Many would-be astronomers become frustrated or lose interest in their manual telescope because they don’t know where to point it to see planets, star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies—the good stuff! StarSense Explorer tells you exactly which celestial objects are currently visible in the night sky and where to move your telescope to place those objects in the telescope’s eyepiece. \n\nTHE NIGHT SKY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nThe user-friendly planetarium interface allows you to scan the skies for objects you wish to view. You can also search for objects in the extensive database. \nNot sure what to observe? StarSense Explorer automatically generates a list of all the best stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and more currently visible from your location. Simply select one from the list and off you go! \nWhile you observe, you can access detailed information, images, and audio descriptions for the most popular objects. It’s a great way for the entire family to learn scientific facts, history, mythology, and more, deepening your understanding of the night sky.\n\nEASY AS 1-2-3: DOCK, LAUNCH, OBSERVE\n\nTo get started, assemble your StarSense Explorer telescope and download the app. Your telescope includes a unique unlock code to access the full features of the app. Connect your phone to the telescope by placing it into the StarSense dock and launch the app.\nAfter a simple 2-step procedure to align the smartphone’s camera with the telescope, the app displays a view of the night sky and shows a bullseye on the screen to represent the telescope’s current pointing position. From here, you can select an object to view by tapping it in the planetarium view or selecting it from the Tonight’s Best observing list. Objects will vary from night to night; you may see planets like Jupiter or Saturn, nebulae like Orion, the Andromeda Galaxy, or other object types.\nOnce you select an object, the app displays pointing arrows onscreen. These indicate where to move the telescope to find it. Follow the arrows until the bullseye appears centered on target. When the bullseye turns green, the object is visible in the telescope’s lower powered eyepiece. \n\nHOW STARSENSE EXPLORER WORKS\n\nStarSense Explorer uses image data captured by the smartphone’s camera to determine its pointing position. The app captures an image of the night sky and then matches the star patterns within the image to its internal database in a process like fingerprint matching or facial recognition. \nThe process of extracting star pattern data in images to determine a telescope’s current pointing position is called “plate solving.” It is the same method used by professional observatories and orbiting satellites. \nThe StarSense Explorer app is the first app ever developed that uses plate solving to determine the smartphone’s current pointing position. Other astronomy apps rely on the smartphone’s gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compass to estimate its pointing position. These methods are not accurate enough to place objects within the telescope’s field of view. \nStarSense Explorer technology is patent-pending. \n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nCompatible with iPhone 6 and higher.\n\nLOCALIZATION\n\nSupport for English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Japanese and Russian."

Theses texts are processed with powerful \"big data\" algorithms and machine learning to provide you the best results. \r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by context? The search results (translation) of a specific word or expression are weaved within real-life sentences, so you will be sure to understand and learn exactly how the word can be used, and make no embarrassing mistakes.  \r\n\r\nJust type or say the word or expression you wish to translate and the results will appear instantly:  relevant translations, presented with examples of how words are used in sentences.\r\n\r\nThe app offers flashcards and quizzes based on your search history and favorites to help you memorize them and to improve your language skills.

Lists remain available even when you’re offline. \r\n* Enjoy natural pronunciation of complete example sentences.\r\n* One click to get translations, frequency details, and  conjugation when applicable.\r\n* Search history, also available offline.\r\n* Suggestions: words and expressions will be suggested to you as you type.\r\n* Share your findings via email or social media.\r\n\r\nAuto-renewable subscription terms:\r\nChoose a subscription that fits your needs:\r\n- Monthly subscription (with a 7-day free trial) for €3.99 EUR;\r\n- Annual subscription for €29.99 EUR;\r\nThese prices corresponds to the same price tier that \"Apple's App Store Matrix\" determines in other currencies.\r\nPlease note:\r\n-Your free trial subscription will automatically renew to a paid subscription unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial period. \r\n-Any unused portion of a free trial period (if offered) will be forfeited when a premium subscription is purchased during the free trial period.\r\nThe free trial or the subscription can be canceled anytime by turning off auto-renewal in the iTunes account settings. This must be done 24 hours before the end of a free trial or subscription period to avoid being charged. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free version.\r\nPrivacy policy:\r\nhttp://www.reverso.net/privacy_app.aspx?lang=EN\r\nTerms of use:\r\nhttp://www.reverso.net/disclaimer.aspx?lang=EN\r\n\r\n* Join us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reverso.net and follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.reverso.net/ReversoEN to discover new content, languages and features.\r\n* Visit our website: http://context.reverso.net/"

Want a blue crystal that corresponds to the Throat Chakra and aids meditation? No problem! Looking for a green crystal from South America with a vitreous lustre? We can show you loads! Looking to learn about a random new crystal? Use the dice button to pick one at random!\n\nEach crystal entry contains general information; a Geological tab detailing the Chemical Formula, Hardness, Colour Variations, Crystal System, Streak, Lustre and the main locations it can be found; and a Healing tab detailing the Metaphysical Properties, Chakra, Zodiac, Elemental, Numerology and Planetary associations. You can also use the Own and Wishlist buttons to build up your collection and quickly access them using the filters to only show ones you own.\n\nWe've also included some games, including 4 different styles of Quiz to help you learn (all the answers can be found in the A-Z), and a Pairs memory game using the gorgeous crystal artwork.\n\nPlease bear in mind that we have more information on our website for some crystals – we simply couldn't fit it all in to this pocket edition! We also made the choice to include illustrations of the crystals rather than a lot of photographs. This app is not designed as an identification app, it's designed to help you learn about each crystal. Many crystals come in so many different colours and formations, it would be impossible to include every variation! If we had 10 different high resolution photos for over 360 different crystals, this app would be far too big to download! We hope you enjoy the beautiful artwork we have created, and that you find our app helpful! This is not a fixed and exhaustive list of crystals, we're always looking to add, update and expand this app to make it as useful as possible. If you think of a crystal we have not yet added, please drop us a message via our website with any suggestions!"

Programming language is a perfect tool for studying, complex mathematical calculation, entertainment and many other useful tasks. The application is especially useful for learning the SQL programming language. You have to buy compilations inside the application. Internet connection is required.\n\n- The great programming tool on the AppStore.\n- Your programming language for iOS is amazing!\n\n* FEATURES *\n\n- Compile and run your program.\n- Text input before program run and text output.\n- Enhanced source code editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, color themes and additional keyboard.\n- Online language reference and several program samples.\n\n* LIMITATIONS *\n\n- Internet connection is required to compile and run a program.\n- Graphics, network, file system and real-time input are not supported.\n- Maximum running time of a program is 15 seconds.\n\nThanks for using the application! \n\n====================================\n\nSQL is a programming language designed for managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). \n\nOriginally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, its scope includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. \n\nSQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F. Codd's relational model, as described in his influential 1970 paper, \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\". Despite not adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language, it also includes procedural elements. SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standards (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been enhanced several times with added features. However, issues of SQL code portability between major RDBMS products still exist due to lack of full compliance with, or different interpretations of, the standard. Among the reasons mentioned are the large size and incomplete specification of the standard, as well as vendor lock-in. \n\nSQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in the early 1970s. This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasi-relational database management system, System R, which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s. The acronym SEQUEL was later changed to SQL because \"SEQUEL\" was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley aircraft company. \n\nThe first Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) was RDMS, developed at MIT in the early 1970s, soon followed by Ingres, developed in 1974 at U.C. Berkeley. Ingres implemented a query language known as QUEL, which was later supplanted in the marketplace by SQL.\n\nAfter testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing commercial products based on their System R prototype including System/38, SQL/DS, and DB2, which were commercially available in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively."

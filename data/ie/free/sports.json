As well as using QR barcodes to load the course, start, finish and read checkpoints, you can now use your device's GPS to detect your location.\n\niOrienteering allows both score and point to point (linear) courses. Checkpoints can now be used multiple times, so Phi or Butterfly loops can be created\n\nYou can set up private or public course. \n\nPrivate if just for you, your friends, a school or club. Public if anyone can take part.\n\nSimple and great fun. It is free to use. Although designed for orienteering it can be used in any situation where you would like to time or score an event, or you simply what to show someone has traveled to a specific location. \n\nFor a fun example, you could use it on a stag night with a barcode at each pub or on a car navigation event to show various points have been visited. \n\nIf you use the app for something unusual then tell us about it as we'd love to hear about it."

No credit card required.\n\nAthletes: CoachNow is 100% FREE for athletes and parents to use. Please follow your coaches instructions before creating an account.\n\n\nCOACHING COMMUNICATION FEATURES\n\nThink of CoachNow as a One-Stop-Shop for all your coaching needs.\n\nCreate private “Spaces” with your individual athletes. There you can create posts, analyze videos, and give feedback in a secure, private channel dedicated solely to your athlete's improvement.\n\nCoaching a team or group of athletes? \"Groups\" are like Spaces, but designed with features that support a team environment. Within \"Groups\", create channels of common topics (e.g. \"Scheduling\", \"Game day Plans\", \"Team Goals\"), allowing your whole team to easily communicate and achieve their goals faster than ever.\n\nQuickly Post or Reply in a “Space” or “Group” with Videos, Images, Audio, Text, Spreadsheets, Documents, and more – all easily accessible, right when you need them.\n\nEasily reuse all past documents, videos, and photos with your personal Cloud Library. All paid plans include Cloud Storage.\n\nFor more information on CoachNow’s Communication features, check out www.coachnow.io/communication\n\n\nVIDEO AND IMAGE ANALYSIS FEATURES\n\nAccess the Video Analysis Tools directly in an athlete Space or Group.\n\nWhen creating a post, you can shoot a new video, re-use a video from your Personal CoachNow library, or upload one from your camera roll.\n\nAdd context to your feedback with built-in Voice Over. Add your voice to any video or photo to add more context to your training. Using this feature is an easy, fast, and potent way to deliver high-value coaching feedback in a high-touch way.\n\nFilm at 240 fps and use the Slow Motion Feature to break down every movement and deliver feedback with pinpoint accuracy every time.\n\nEliminate confusion with dynamic annotation tools. Use angles, shapes, timers, etc to provide technical feedback and keep your athlete hyper-aware of their form.\n\nCompare your athletes side-by-side with Comparison Shots. Seeing two shots side by side gives a far more dynamic and insightful look than a single shot.\n\nFor more information on CoachNow’s Video and Image Analysis Suite, check out www.coachnow.io/video\n\n\nMEMBERSHIPS\n\nCoachNow Free\n\nOur Free version for Athletes and their support.

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

Add a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and never worry about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM-compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM for whatever local carriers exist in the country you’re currently in, but without this old-school plastic SIM card you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIM is a true technological revolution and we bring it right into your eSIM compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or pay for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your own phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store for your convenience. Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find an updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link: https://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to get connected during their travels - it doesn't matter whether you're a seafarer, flight crew, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries -  We are here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more enormous roaming data fees\n* Installation in 2 minutes or less\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your number as you travel\n* No more fumbling to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky Wi-Fi dongle around\n\nHow does it work?\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM You can install your eSIM directly or by scanning a QR code or manually inserting an activation code provided. You can also manage and top-up your eSIMs with your Airalo account.\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fragile, tiny hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things easier for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees. \n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

      "label": "The most-used e-scooter sharing app in Europe. Travel quickly whenever you want through the city on an electric shared scooter. Find a felyx e-scooter in your neighbourhood, book it and activate it through the app and off you go!  \n \n\nFelyx e-scooter sharing is now available in more than 10 cities in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Groningen, Brussels, Berlin, Hamburg and many more! \n\nThe benefits of the felyx e-scooter app: \n\n● Reserving: snag it. You can book an e-scooter for free for up to 10 minutes, after which you pay €0.15 per extended minute.  \n\n● Smart radar function: get a notification when a shared scooter becomes free in your area. \n\n● Earn free riding minutes: invite your friends and receive 15 free minutes of riding per registered friend.  \n\n● Parking mode: would you like to park the felyx e-scooter for a while, but not run the risk of someone else renting it? Use the parking mode and keep the shared scooter for €0.10/min (NL) or €0,13 p/m (DE) and €0.15 p/m (BE). \n\n● Smartphone charger: charge your smartphone while you ride. Use the USB port and your own USB cable as soon as the e-scooter is activated.  \n\n● Battery status: overview of the battery capacity of each e-scooter before you book. \n\nHow does the felyx e-scooter sharing app work? \n\n1. Register in just a few minutes \n\nSimply register with the practical driver's license verification system in the app. Add your payment information and you're ready to ride.  \n\n2. Finding & renting \n\nUse the app to find a felyx scooter near you and make a reservation at the push of a button. \n\n3. Activate & off you go! \n\nActivate the e-scooter in the app and ride anywhere within the service area quickly and carefree. We make sure batteries are full and maintenance is taken care of. \n\n4. Parking & locking \n\nArrived safe? Park properly in the service area and end the rental via the app. No-hassle payment, minutes ridden are automatically debited from your bank account.  \n\n\nFrequently asked questions about felyx e-scooter sharing: \nWhat do you do regarding the hygiene of a felyx e-scooter? \nBoth e-scooters and helmets are cleaned and disinfected on a daily basis. All e-scooters capable of going 45 km/h are equipped with helmets and hairnets.  \n\nI don't live in a city with felyx, can I hire an e-scooter? \nYes, you can! Registering is quick and easy. Just choose the city you are planning to make your first ride \n\nWhat does felyx cost? \nWith felyx, you only pay for what you use. In the Netherlands and Belgium, you pay from €0.25/min and in Germany you’re paying from €0.18/min \n\nAt the moment, you don't pay any registration fee, but we do charge unlock fee of €0.50 per ride. \n\nDo I need a driver's license and if so, what type? \nClass B (which also allows you to drive a car), class A or a moped license (class AM). \n\nCan I drive and park outside a service area? \nYou can drive the felyx e-scooter outside the green marked areas in the app. However, activating and ending the rental is only possible within those green areas. It is possible to use the parking mode outside the service area at €0.10 p/m (NL), €0,13 p/m (DE) and €0.15 p/m (BE). The service area for a given city can be found on our website and on the map in the app. Make sure you park the felyx e-scooter properly: do not block the pavement for pedestrians, wheelchairs and prams. \n \nAbout felyx e-scooter sharing \nWe are a Dutch scale-up with ambitious plans for sustainable suburban transport. Want to know more about us? Do you have suggestions or ideas? Send us an e-mail (klantenservice@felyx.nl) or visit our website."

It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

Weather +  Webcams\n\nThe station is powered by a Davis Pro 2 Plus Wireless with 24hrs Fars and Soil temp and Moisture sensors. The data is collected every 30 seconds and the site is updated every 60 seconds. This site and its data is collected using Weather Display Software. The station is comprised of an anemometer, a rain gauge and a thermo-hydro sensor situated in optimal positions for highest accuracy possible.\n\nAbout This Location\n\nLocated in southeastern Ireland and about 40km from the Irish Sea, Tullow has a rather mild, maritime climate. Rainfall is frequent (though often light) year-round in most years, totalling about 800mm. Winter temperatures average about 6-10 C for daytime highs and just above freezing for morning lows. The rural location allows a fair number of frosty nights, but -10 C is about the coldest it can get. Summers are pleasantly mild, with daytime highs mostly 15-25 C and nighttime lows about 6-13 C. A few warm days each summer may approach 30 C. Snow is somewhat rare, and when it occurs it usually melts quickly. Hail and Thunder are somewhat unusual but can occur at any time of year.\n\nAbout the website\n\nThe site is operated by Alan O'Reilly and feedback and suggestions are always welcome, please email carlowweather at gmail.com."

      "label": "Trying to avoid walking straight into a rainstorm when you go out? Check our rain radar and rain graph before you leave so you never have to get drenched!\n\t\nDe Buienradar app starts with the 3 hour or the 24 hour rain radar forecast. The rain radar image will show you whether it is going to rain in the next upcoming hours or even the next day. Below the radar is the rain graph. In this graph you can see exactly when it is going to rain and how much rainfall is predicted (in millimeters). If you prefer an even more detailed image of your city or town you can press the magnifying glass icon to zoom in.\n\nThe Buienradar app is suitable for iPhone and iPad. Via the handy widgets (with rain graph for your current location) you can quickly see on your today's screen whether it will rain soon without opening the app. The widget is now also visible with 3D touch: press the Buienradar app icon a little harder in your app overview to make the widget appear.\n\nBesides the Buienradar you can also find other radars and maps:\n- Drizzle\n- Sun \n- NL Satellite images\n- Storm\n- Pollen (hay fever)\n- Sun (UV)\n- Mosquitos\n- BBQ\n- Temperature\n- Feeling temperature\n- Wind\n- Fog\n- Snow\n- EU Buienradar (rain radar)\n- EU Satellite images\n\nYou can find personalized weather info in the table “Komende uren in” (Next 8 hours weather prediction) for your favorite location (even abroad!) like hour-to-hour predictions for: temperature, feeling temperature, the number of millimeters of rain per hour, the chance of rain and wind force (in Beaufort).\n\nBesides thunderstorm, snow, sun, wind and temperature maps we also offer wind chill, ground temperature, sun intensity, air pressure, gusts, visibility and humidity data, together with the exact times of sunrise and sunset for your location.\n\nWe also offer seasonal radar maps. In the summer, for example, you can use our pollen and mosquito radars in order to receive a timely notification when it is wise to hang up your mosquito net. In the winter you can use our snowradar, which informs you about winter precipitation, but we also offer a map especially for ground temperature which warns you about night frost.\n\nIn the “14-daagse” tab (14 day forecast) you will find the weather forecast (in a graph) for the next 14 days. You can also see a detailed list view when you click on the tab “Lijst”. This list offers an hourly forecast for the next 7 days and a daily average for the second week.\n\nIn the “Meldingen” tab you can create your own rain alert (free push notification) customized to your daily time schedule and favorite locations so you will never be unprepared for rain or a storm.\n\nIf you don't want to see ads, we also offer the Buienradar Plus plan for €3,49 per year. You can find this easily in “Instellingen” (“Settings”) and then press “Neem Buienradar Plus” (Get Buienradar Plus).\n\nOur Terms of Use can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/gebruikers-voorwaarden.html\n\nOur Privacy statement can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/privacy-statement.html\n\nWe are continuously improving the Buienradar app. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve or if you have any questions, you can always reach out to us by using the feedback form in the app or by sending us an e-mail via appsupport@buienradar.nl. Thanks!"

Real moon phases.\n\nMORE ACCURATE WEATHER DATA\nEasy tap to reveal all the underlying weather data—wind speed, direction, humidity, visibility, air quality, dew point, moon phase, cloud coverage, and more. Multiple weather forecasters to choose from for the most accurate for your region.\n\nNEXT-HOUR FORECAST\nKnow when rain is coming down to the minute.\n\nMOON PHASES\nTrack an accurate representation of the moon phase.\n\nBIG & READABLE\nBig numbers you can read across a room.\n\nWIDGETS\nAlways see the current weather right on your home screen.\n\nSKINS\nSkins change the whole look and feel of the app. New skins and collaborations every season so you can keep it fresh.\n\nPLANS\nThis app requires a subscription.

      "label": "This app uses the barometric pressure sensor built into all the newer iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch Models sold after 2016 with few exceptions. You need one of these newer devices to use this App. See below which older iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch without this sensor are not supported!\n\nThis App features a Barometer for weather, an Altimeter for outdoor activities, a barometric Trend and a Notification Center Widget.\n\nEven without the optional In-App-Purchase this is a fully functional Barometer with absolutely no draw-backs and all important features accessible. Always without ads! (See \"Pro Features\" at the end). No internet connection required, no data transmitted - runs on your device only!\n\nKeep an eye on the barometric pressure and be your own weather forecast! This little app uses only GPS (optional) and the new barometric pressure sensor to calculate the barometric pressure used in weather forecasts. The new iPhones have a barometric pressure sensor built in so this app works completely without internet. The handy marker helps you keep track of changes in the barometric pressure and let's you predict weather changes! Please realize, that a single barometric pressure reading is not enough to tell the current weather situation but the barometric pressure and its change over time is a very good indicator for weather changes!\n\nNow you can also see the trend in barometric pressure with graph charts displaying the measurements taken during the last 30 days! (6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d)\n\nThe Altimeter helps you track your altitude changes based on the change of pressure. Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for checking how high up the mountain you have climbed (works for other activities too). The App does not use GPS for the Altimeter.\n\nPlease Note that on older devices such as the 4S, 5, 5S and 5C as well as on any iPod Touch and iPad Models older than iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4 as well as the Apple Watch 1 and 2, this app will not be able to read barometric pressure values and not display any useful information. The first generation 4-inch iPhone SE is not supported - the new SE (2020) is!\n\nAll basic features, the Barometer, the Altimeter, the Trend and the Widget are completely free to use for everyone and are fully functional at maximum accuracy available. No ads!\nThe only features with restricted access via In-App-Purchase are listed at the end under \"Pro Features\". Those are nice to have features for power users or those that want to show their support for the App!\n\nFeatures (free for everyone)\n- Barometer for weather\n- Altimeter for outdoor activities\n- HomeScreen Widget (iOS 14 and newer)\n- Today-View Widget (all Versions)\n- Watch App\n- Up to 30d trend visualised with graphs\n- Interactive timeline on the trend graphs\n- No internet connection required since the sensor is built into the new iPhones and iPads\n- Supports 6 different pressure units\n- Support for 2 different altitude units\n- Analog Barometer with support for all 6 units\n- Configurable \"displayed accuracy\" / number of decimals\n- Supports setting a custom marker so you can track changes in barometric pressure\n- Manual altitude setting or automatic altitude updates based on GPS for the Barometer.\n- GPS Correction. In case your GPS seems to always be 'off' a little you can now fix this easily.\n- Portrait and Landscape support\n- No ads! No data collection beyond your device (history and settings). No web communication at all.\n\nPro Features (one time In-App Purchase required)\n- Change the Barometer Face\n- Fishing Barometer\n- Two scales on the Barometer\n- Data export in CSV Format"

Devices with built-in sensors will get values from it and for those without sensors, the pressure value is reported by the nearest weather station.\n\nWith our clean and intuitive app, you can see the  current pressure with just one look. You can save any current value to compare pressure from other days. What's coolest is that you can swipe through multiple units and instantly see the pressure in the value you are interested in, including:\n- pounds per square inch\n- millibar\n- hectopascal\n- kilopascal\n- millimeter of mercury\n- bar\n- inch of mercury\n\nYou can also change preferred units in settings.\n\nWith one screen swipe, you can see an altimeter gauge with current values, our precise altitude calculation algorithms (which involve GPS, network services and calibrated pressure sensors) we deliver you the most accurate elevation info as possible, in barometric units or if you prefer, you can swipe over to metric and imperial units.\n\nThe third screen of the application has clear, accurate weather info, which includes:\n- temperature\n- wind speed\n- wind direction\n- humidity\n- cloudiness\n- dew point temperature\n- fog\n\nDevices with pressure sensors now have the possibility to switch from average elevation reported on the Altimeter screen to barometer-based elevation only You are also now able to calibrate with your own mean sea level pressure value.\n\nThe history screen has been redesigned and you can now choose from four different values - MSL pressure, ground level pressure, temperature and elevation. You can also now easily filter data according to any time span you want.\n\nA brand-new functionality of custom notifications has also been added. You can now add time-based notifications: just setup the time and days on which you want to receive notifications with current pressure values and voila. You can also set a pressure level alarm, above or below which the device will warn you. What’s even more, you can receive notifications after pressure changes by the value you set.\n\nAn autosave function is now available. You can set a time interval at which your device will automatically save pressure, temperature and elevation values to give you up to the minute information about weather changes.\n\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/barometer\r\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/barometer"

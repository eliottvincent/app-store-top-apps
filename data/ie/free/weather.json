Weather +  Webcams\n\nThe station is powered by a Davis Pro 2 Plus Wireless with 24hrs Fars and Soil temp and Moisture sensors. The data is collected every 30 seconds and the site is updated every 60 seconds. This site and its data is collected using Weather Display Software. The station is comprised of an anemometer, a rain gauge and a thermo-hydro sensor situated in optimal positions for highest accuracy possible.\n\nAbout This Location\n\nLocated in southeastern Ireland and about 40km from the Irish Sea, Tullow has a rather mild, maritime climate. Rainfall is frequent (though often light) year-round in most years, totalling about 800mm. Winter temperatures average about 6-10 C for daytime highs and just above freezing for morning lows. The rural location allows a fair number of frosty nights, but -10 C is about the coldest it can get. Summers are pleasantly mild, with daytime highs mostly 15-25 C and nighttime lows about 6-13 C. A few warm days each summer may approach 30 C. Snow is somewhat rare, and when it occurs it usually melts quickly. Hail and Thunder are somewhat unusual but can occur at any time of year.\n\nAbout the website\n\nThe site is operated by Alan O'Reilly and feedback and suggestions are always welcome, please email carlowweather at gmail.com."

      "label": "Simple and beautiful rustic style Thermometer now in your iPhone or iPad.\n\nWhat people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:\n\n- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

      "label": "Благодаря этому приложению теперь на iPhone и iPad можно получить уличную температуру и давление практически везде, где бы вы ни находились.\nПриложение, используя ваши данные местонахождения, ищет среди датчиков проекта narodmon.ru ближайший к вам, и показывает вам температуру и давление, которую он измерил.  Это реальные показатели реального устройства, а не домыслы спутников. А также можно вывести графики изменения температуры и давления за день, неделю, месяц и год.\nВ больших городах датчиков много, поэтому реальные показания практически всегда показываются правильно, т.к. датчик находится недалеко. Радиус сканирования датчика - 100 километров. \nВ удаленных местах, где датчиков мало, значения могут отличаться от реальных из-за дальности нахождения датчика.\nВ случае недоступности GPS данных, координаты вашего местонахождения будут получаться через сотовую связь. \nИндикатор типа получаемых данных находится в правом верхнем углу экрана. Также в нем показывается дальность нахождения датчика, с которого получена температура. \nВ случае отсутствия интернета, будет показано уведомление об этом.\nИмеется приложение для Apple Watch и виджет Today.\nВ версии 1.5 добавлена карта и и отображение ближайших датчиков на ней. Можно выбрать новое местоположение и приложение покажет ближайшие датчики к новому предполагаемому местоположению и посмотреть графики изменения температуры в выбранном месте.\nДобавлены кнопки манипулирования картой. Можно приближать, отдалять и позиционировать себя. Также поддерживаются манипуляции пальцами.\nВ версии 1.9.3 добавлены графики изменения давления и добавлены индикаторы тенденций изменения давления. Т.е. теперь приложение дает кратковременные прогнозы погоды в вашем местоположении."

Devices with built-in sensors will get values from it and for those without sensors, the pressure value is reported by the nearest weather station.\n\nWith our clean and intuitive app, you can see the  current pressure with just one look. You can save any current value to compare pressure from other days. What's coolest is that you can swipe through multiple units and instantly see the pressure in the value you are interested in, including:\n- pounds per square inch\n- millibar\n- hectopascal\n- kilopascal\n- millimeter of mercury\n- bar\n- inch of mercury\n\nYou can also change preferred units in settings.\n\nWith one screen swipe, you can see an altimeter gauge with current values, our precise altitude calculation algorithms (which involve GPS, network services and calibrated pressure sensors) we deliver you the most accurate elevation info as possible, in barometric units or if you prefer, you can swipe over to metric and imperial units.\n\nThe third screen of the application has clear, accurate weather info, which includes:\n- temperature\n- wind speed\n- wind direction\n- humidity\n- cloudiness\n- dew point temperature\n- fog\n\nDevices with pressure sensors now have the possibility to switch from average elevation reported on the Altimeter screen to barometer-based elevation only You are also now able to calibrate with your own mean sea level pressure value.\n\nThe history screen has been redesigned and you can now choose from four different values - MSL pressure, ground level pressure, temperature and elevation. You can also now easily filter data according to any time span you want.\n\nA brand-new functionality of custom notifications has also been added. You can now add time-based notifications: just setup the time and days on which you want to receive notifications with current pressure values and voila. You can also set a pressure level alarm, above or below which the device will warn you. What’s even more, you can receive notifications after pressure changes by the value you set.\n\nAn autosave function is now available. You can set a time interval at which your device will automatically save pressure, temperature and elevation values to give you up to the minute information about weather changes.\n\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/barometer\r\nhttps://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/barometer"

You’ve added the city to your locations.\n\nREMOVE / CHANGE ORDER OF LOCATIONS\nYou can remove the locations you added in your location overview, which is accessed by tapping on the magnifying glass symbol in the top left corner. Here you can either swipe the location to the left and press the red delete button that appears next to it, or use the Edit button that is found at the bottom of the page.

We take weather conditions like cloud cover, visibility, time of day etc. along with aurora score to generate a score that can help you find the aurora visibility times for a gives city. Along with aurora, weather conditions are also predicted for up to 4 days. We also let users checkin an aurora sighting and alert based on that.\n\nWe track ~24K cities around the world for aurora activity and weather conditions. It is easy to get started by subscribing to alerts for multiple cities and get alerted on the app for free. Realtime aurora map shows the aurora activity on the map and you can interact with the map to select the cities we are tracking from map and having activity at that time. Aurora Travel destination searching is easier with this and with our city search page you can search by city or country for viewing the city aurora forecast report and subscribe to cities for alerts. You can favorite the cities for quick accesses in the future even if you are not registered with an account.\n\nAs we track city specific aurora scores, we cover cities under the northern lights (aurora borealis), southern lights (aurora australis) and even cities where aurora hasn't occurred till date. Web page has sighting specific pages to chat on realtime aurora sighting, this will be released soon in the app version too. \n\nEnjoy hunting auroras with AuroraReach and find your next aurora destination with this app."

      "label": "Trying to avoid walking straight into a rainstorm when you go out? Check our rain radar and rain graph before you leave so you never have to get drenched!\n\t\nDe Buienradar app starts with the 3 hour or the 24 hour rain radar forecast. The rain radar image will show you whether it is going to rain in the next upcoming hours or even the next day. Below the radar is the rain graph. In this graph you can see exactly when it is going to rain and how much rainfall is predicted (in millimeters). If you prefer an even more detailed image of your city or town you can press the magnifying glass icon to zoom in.\n\nThe Buienradar app is suitable for iPhone and iPad. Via the handy widgets (with rain graph for your current location) you can quickly see on your today's screen whether it will rain soon without opening the app. The widget is now also visible with 3D touch: press the Buienradar app icon a little harder in your app overview to make the widget appear.\n\nBesides the Buienradar you can also find other radars and maps:\n- Drizzle\n- Sun \n- NL Satellite images\n- Storm\n- Pollen (hay fever)\n- Sun (UV)\n- Mosquitos\n- BBQ\n- Temperature\n- Feeling temperature\n- Wind\n- Fog\n- Snow\n- EU Buienradar (rain radar)\n- EU Satellite images\n\nYou can find personalized weather info in the table “Komende uren in” (Next 8 hours weather prediction) for your favorite location (even abroad!) like hour-to-hour predictions for: temperature, feeling temperature, the number of millimeters of rain per hour, the chance of rain and wind force (in Beaufort).\n\nBesides thunderstorm, snow, sun, wind and temperature maps we also offer wind chill, ground temperature, sun intensity, air pressure, gusts, visibility and humidity data, together with the exact times of sunrise and sunset for your location.\n\nWe also offer seasonal radar maps. In the summer, for example, you can use our pollen and mosquito radars in order to receive a timely notification when it is wise to hang up your mosquito net. In the winter you can use our snowradar, which informs you about winter precipitation, but we also offer a map especially for ground temperature which warns you about night frost.\n\nIn the “14-daagse” tab (14 day forecast) you will find the weather forecast (in a graph) for the next 14 days. You can also see a detailed list view when you click on the tab “Lijst”. This list offers an hourly forecast for the next 7 days and a daily average for the second week.\n\nIn the “Meldingen” tab you can create your own rain alert (free push notification) customized to your daily time schedule and favorite locations so you will never be unprepared for rain or a storm.\n\nIf you don't want to see ads, we also offer the Buienradar Plus plan for €3,49 per year. You can find this easily in “Instellingen” (“Settings”) and then press “Neem Buienradar Plus” (Get Buienradar Plus).\n\nOur Terms of Use can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/gebruikers-voorwaarden.html\n\nOur Privacy statement can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/privacy-statement.html\n\nWe are continuously improving the Buienradar app. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve or if you have any questions, you can always reach out to us by using the feedback form in the app or by sending us an e-mail via appsupport@buienradar.nl.

There are many settings for units and format of METAR/TAF available.\n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes basic airport data like sunrise/sunset, twilight times, timezones etc. \n\nAeroWeather Lite offers built-in groups for nearby stations, today widget (pre iOS 14), and earthquakes. Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view.\n\nMETAR alert notifications** is an helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with the following criteria: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility, and ceiling (BKN and OVC). Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when wind is greater/equal 10 kts, flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data comes primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. The pictures will be available to all other pilots (on the map or within an airport detail view) helping them to get a better idea about local conditions. AeroPix should be especially helpful when there's no or insufficient webcam coverage.\n\nThere's also an iMessage app included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. In order to keep AeroWeather Lite free we added a small ad banner at the bottom of the screen. Consider getting AeroWeather Pro, subscribe the additional features**, or remove the ad banner through one-time unlock* to have an ad-free app.\n\n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - METAR/TAF from ADS-B receiver thru GDL 90 protocol (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nWhen using AeroWeather Lite also the following features are enabled:\n - Remove ad banner\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled.

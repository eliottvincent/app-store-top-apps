      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

You can also get alert services for the solar wind data, Kp index, and hemispheric power. These extra services can be purchased within the app.\n\nThe app also provides predicted and observed Kp index, solar wind data directly from DSCOVR, such as solar wind speed and magnetic field (Bz and Bt), and graphs with recent data to help you predict auroral activity as well as the hemispheric power for the last 6 hours.\n\nThe app focuses much on the activity right now, but we also added a 3 day Kp forecast which can give you a hint which days you could expect higher activity.

Weather +  Webcams\n\nThe station is powered by a Davis Pro 2 Plus Wireless with 24hrs Fars and Soil temp and Moisture sensors. The data is collected every 30 seconds and the site is updated every 60 seconds. This site and its data is collected using Weather Display Software. The station is comprised of an anemometer, a rain gauge and a thermo-hydro sensor situated in optimal positions for highest accuracy possible.\n\nAbout This Location\n\nLocated in southeastern Ireland and about 40km from the Irish Sea, Tullow has a rather mild, maritime climate. Rainfall is frequent (though often light) year-round in most years, totalling about 800mm. Winter temperatures average about 6-10 C for daytime highs and just above freezing for morning lows. The rural location allows a fair number of frosty nights, but -10 C is about the coldest it can get. Summers are pleasantly mild, with daytime highs mostly 15-25 C and nighttime lows about 6-13 C. A few warm days each summer may approach 30 C. Snow is somewhat rare, and when it occurs it usually melts quickly. Hail and Thunder are somewhat unusual but can occur at any time of year.\n\nAbout the website\n\nThe site is operated by Alan O'Reilly and feedback and suggestions are always welcome, please email carlowweather at gmail.com."

Knowing when sun protection is recommended wherever you are in the world gives you confidence to enjoy the sun safely, minimizing the risk of skin damage which can lead to cancer. \n\nThe SunSmart Global UV app takes the guesswork out of being safe in the sun with daily sun protection times sent to your phone along with simple advice for protecting your skin.\n\n***What are sun protection times?***\nSun protection times are linked to the UV Index and are advised when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above. This is consistent with the WHO UV Index guidance and has been determined as the level at which damage to the skin is likely to occur more quickly.\n\nThe app will advise you that sun protection is required during specific times when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above so that you can adequately protect your skin.\n\n***How is it different to other UV apps?***\nThe UV app has the backing of world-leading health and meteorological organisations making it a trusted and reliable source of advice.\n\nUnlike other apps, the SunSmart Global UV app is designed to simply inform users when sun protection is required and when it is not. \n\n***What are the key features?***\n- Daily UV levels for the local area including sun protection times\n- 5-day forecast including UV and weather forecast\n- Access to the forecast UV and sun protection times anywhere in the world"

No fuss, no configuration, just quick weather readouts.\n \nWind Compass Features::\n•  Select Wind Speed reading by switching between Miles/hour or Kilometers/hour or Knots or Beaufort Wind Force or Meters Per Second\n• Select Compass Magnetic Declination from True North or Magnetic North\n• Select Temperature measurement from Fahrenheit or Celsius\n• Select the Arrow direction of the Wind Indicator from Blowing To or Coming From\n \nWeather Forecast Features:\n• Current Temperature as well as the Estimated Highs and Lows for that day\n• Sunrise/Sunset times as well as the \"First Light\" and \"Last light\" times for that day (Also known as Nautical Twilight Start and End)\n• 24 Hour Forecast as well as 7 Day Forecast showing: Time, Estimated Temperature, Estimated Wind Speed and Direction and % Chance of precipitation\n \nCustom Background Settings\nYou can also change the look of the app by selecting from the many different background types including standard colored backgrounds, as well as backgrounds like a map showing your current location, an overlay showing what your rear camera sees, and even a color gradient that auto adjusts from warm to cool based on the temperature of where you are!\n \nWind Compass uses the Forecast.io Weather data to provide accurate conditions where you are. Just open the app, let it update, and there you go. Forecast.io uses many sources and creates as accurate of a forecast as possible for your location.\n \nAs an added bonus, Wind Compass shows you which way is North so if you are inside or turned around, you can always know which way is north, along with the current wind direction.\n \nIf you have any issues with Wind Compass please email contact@maplemedia.io to quickly get the issue resolved. You can also submit a feature request or bug report right from inside the settings menu. \n \n*NOTE* Compass functionality within the app requires physical compass functionality built in. iPods can still get direction info but the compass will not update real time.\n \n*NOTE* Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n \nCredits\n \nWind Icon designed by Jojo Franklin from J.Franklin Design (http://jfranklin.design).\n \nForecast Information Powered by Dark Sky https://darksky.net/poweredby/\n\nSubscription Terms: https://maplemedia.io/terms-of-service/\n\nSUPPORT: contact@maplemedia.io"

Real moon phases.\n\nMORE ACCURATE WEATHER DATA\nEasy tap to reveal all the underlying weather data—wind speed, direction, humidity, visibility, air quality, dew point, moon phase, cloud coverage, and more. Multiple weather forecasters to choose from for the most accurate for your region.\n\nNEXT-HOUR FORECAST\nKnow when rain is coming down to the minute.\n\nMOON PHASES\nTrack an accurate representation of the moon phase.\n\nBIG & READABLE\nBig numbers you can read across a room.\n\nWIDGETS\nAlways see the current weather right on your home screen.\n\nSKINS\nSkins change the whole look and feel of the app. New skins and collaborations every season so you can keep it fresh.\n\nPLANS\nThis app requires a subscription.

Weather Strip only stores location data on your local device, and it always uses approximate locations when requesting weather forecasts.\n\nWeather Strip also respects your data plan, with optional background app refresh that automatically learns your habits, and the ability to view your recent forecasts even when your connection drops.\n\nWeather Strip is completely free to try for two weeks. After that, a minimal subscription price helps us keep the service running. (Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled within 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.)\n\nNot all features are available in all locations. Forecasts are issued by Foreca globally and by the U.S. National Weather Service (NOAA NWS) in the United States. Forecasts usually span 168 hours (7 days) but can occasionally be longer or shorter.\n\nDesigned by data visualization researcher Robin Stewart to help everyone enjoy the outdoors."

The times are precisely calculated for your location and displayed alongside the cloud forecasts so it has never been easier to observe. It is our favourite feature :-) \n\nAlso includes regular weather data (wind, rain, frost, temperature, dew point, etc) so perfect for those wanting a detailed weather forecast, without cutesy graphics. \n\nWe have had a lot of fun building and testing Clear Outside and are keen to to develop it further so if you find it useful or have suggestions, please let us know."

Log.\n\nGarmin Pilot is the most comprehensive suite of tools for the iPad designed specifically for general aviation and corporate pilots. Flight planning, charts, interactive maps, weather briefing resources and navigation capabilities; it’s all included. The app’s intuitive interface mirrors those on the newest Garmin touchscreen avionics so you can go seamlessly from preflight to inflight.  \n\nPlan \n\nGarmin Pilot’s powerful capabilities start with pre-flight planning, providing pilots with the most comprehensive aviation weather information to make better-informed flight decisions. Pilots can check NEXRAD radar, visible and infrared cloud imagery, METARs, TAFs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, PIREPs, NOTAMs, winds and temperature aloft, TFRs and lightning data. With Garmin Pilot, data can be displayed over Garmin’s interactive maps that support track-up navigation, VFR sectional or an IFR low or high en-route chart to visualize the weather for your route. Add text-based weather widgets and use the exclusive NavTrack feature to view weather along the planned route. \n\nFile \n\nWith Garmin Pilot, users can easily enter a flight plan and interactively edit it on the map. Pre-loaded forms make it quick to save and reuse data for frequently flown routes. And when the flight plan is ready, Garmin Pilot makes it simple to file, amend or close the flight plan via Leidos Flight Service or DUATS.  \n\nFly \n\nGarmin Pilot provides full en-route navigation capability on its moving map. Pilots can also navigate with Garmin’s patented panel, a GPS-driven instrument pack with a graphical HSI directional display and indicators for groundspeed, altitude and vertical speed. After takeoff, pilots can continue to view real-time weather in the U.S. and traffic information by wirelessly connecting to Garmin’s GDL 39 3D portable ADS-B Receiver (sold separately). \n\nLog\n\nGarmin Pilot includes a comprehensive electronic logbook that syncs with flyGarmin.  The logbook automatically generates entries based upon GPS data collected during the flight, tracks currency, supports manual entries, endorsements and creates reports.\n\nGarmin Pilot U.S. Standard: \n\n- Rich, interactive maps support Track-Up navigation\n- Charts: VFR Sectionals, low and high IFR en-route, airport diagrams and approach procedures \n- Ability to view Jeppesen Terminal Charts  (Jeppesen echart subscription required)\n- Weather Maps: Animated radar, Infrared and Visible Satellite, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Lightning, TFRs and more!\n- Extensive text products: METARs, TAFs, Winds Aloft, PIREPs, AIRMETs, SIGMETs, Area Forecasts and NOTAMs \n- AOPA Airport Directory\n- Weight and Balance\n- Checklists\n- Flight plan filing via Leidos Flight Services\n- Garmin patented navigation panel \n- Terrain and Obstacles\n- Smart Airspace\n- Fast Find predictive Waypoint Entry\n- Logbook\n- Optional VFR Premium: Synthetic Vision (SVX), Terrain and obstacle alerting, and Garmin SafeTaxi®  \n- Optional IFR Premium: VFR Premium plus geo-referenced Garmin FliteCharts® \n\nGarmin Pilot has regional offerings for Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe and Latin America.

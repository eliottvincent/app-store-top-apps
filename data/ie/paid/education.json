      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Our aim is to provide a comprehensive ISL dictionary system in an easy-to-use form.\n\n---------------\nFeatures\n---------------\n\nEach sign contained within Concise ISL is presented in video form and accompanied by high quality images of the component signs for each hand.\n\nAll signs can be sorted by category, an organisational approach chosen to support learning. \n\nSpecific words and categories can be easily found within Concise ISL, using a simple and efficient search interface, swipe gestures, sliding menus and other intuitive interaction mechanisms.\n\nThis app is designed to be child-appropriate, with the inclusion of a large number of signs in categories such as Animals, Colours, Food, Sports and many others.\n\nThrough the inclusion of signs such as \"texting\", \"tablet\", \"facebook\" and many more, this ISL dictionary reflects the modern context of the language.\n\nConcise ISL currently includes approximately 1000 signs, a figure which we have continuously strived to increase.\n\nConcise ISL supports offline use. A data connection is required to download signs for the first time. These videos are then stored on-device for subsequent viewing offline. This approach allows the inclusion of such a large number of signs without imposing the consumption of a significant amount of on-device memory on all users. The video size has been carefully calculated to reduce bandwidth consumption.\n\nConcise ISL also includes a number of additional sections containing information concerning the history of ISL, the grammatical structure of the language and more.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using Concise ISL!\n\nKevin & Micheál"

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "Мы поможем вам!\n\nВсего за несколько минут в день вы научитесь составлять предложения на английском, незаметно для себя выучите много новых слов.\n\nИнтенсивный обучающий курс «Полиглот» состоит из 16 занятий. После его завершения любой человек легко сможет разговаривать на английском языке.\n\nСписок занятий:\n\n1.   Базовая форма глагола.\n2.   Местоимения. Вопросительные слова.\n3.   Глагол \"to be\". Предлоги места. Like/Want.\n4.   Притяжательные местоимения.\n5.   Профессии. Этикет.\n6.   Степени сравнения прилагательных. Указательные местоимения.\n7.   Слова-параметры. Употребление much и many.\n8.   Предлоги и параметры времени.\n9.   There is / There are.\n10. Предлоги направления и движения.\n11. Модальные глаголы can, must, should.\n12. Continuous \n13. Прилагательные. Описание людей. Погода\n14. Present Perfect\n15. Повелительное наклонение\n16. Фразовые глаголы\n\nКаждое занятие содержит подробное описание грамматики английского языка по данному уроку.\n \nКак это работает?\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам простые выражения на русском языке.\n\nИз слов на экране вам нужно составить английский перевод.\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ. Правильный ответ озвучивается.\n\nЧтобы перейти к следующему уроку необходимо набрать 4.5 балла в предыдущем уроке. Пока баллы не набраны, уроки остаются заблокированными.\n\nРезультаты синхронизируются через iCloud.\n\nКак рассчитываются баллы?\n\nПрограмма помнит 100 последних ответов, количество ПРАВИЛЬНЫХ ответов делит на 100 и умножает на 5.\nЧтобы набрать 4.5 балла надо ответить правильно на 90 вопросов из 100.\n\nСлишком просто?\n\nТогда включите в настройках повышенный уровень сложности. Программа не будет предлагать вам варианты слов, а попросит ввести предложение с клавиатуры.\n\nЭКЗАМЕН\n\nЭкзамен предназначен для закрепления знаний по пройденным урокам. Также он хорошо подходит, чтобы освежить знания.\n\nПо каждому выбранному уроку составляется 10 заданий. Все задания перемешиваются и предлагаются Вам для выполнения в случайном порядке.\n\nПрограмма запоминает результаты выполнения по каждому из уроков в экзамене. По завершении экзамена выставляется общая оценка и оценка по каждому уроку.\n\nНе надо расстраиваться, если с первого раза Вы не получили максимальную оценку.\n\nЭто просто напоминание, что нужно дополнительно потренироваться в соответствующем уроке. Ведь главная цель данного приложения помочь Вам в изучении английского языка, а не выставление оценки за экзамен.\n\nЕсли вы знаете как улучшить программу, напишите нам !\n\nМы ВКонтакте: http://vk.com/polyglotmobile"

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.\n\nThere are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe\n\nSome kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

Crazy Gears is a new-aged digital puzzle game, designed with a real mechanical engine and with children's critical thinking skills in mind! Hours of fun guaranteed for everyone who is up for the challenge, yes, even you Mom & Dad!\n\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2015 ***\n*** Parent's Choice Gold Winner Fall 2015***\n*** App of the week by Fun2Tap ***\n*** Best of the Best by Best Apps For Kids ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n\n\nABOUT CRAZY GEARS\nExplore a captivating digital playground in this tantalizing puzzle game! Children manipulate gears, chains, rods, and pulleys, to pull themselves through each level, which teaches them how different mechanisms affect one another when constructing a machine. Each reasoning challenge was carefully designed to adhere to the theories of educational technology pioneer, mathematician, computer scientist, and designer of the first programming language for children, Seymour Papert.\n\n“The best use of games is to leverage their tendency to enhance learning”- Papert\nRecommended Ages 5-9 \n\nAs a child, Papert fell in love with gears. Their movement fascinated him in every way and inspired his career. Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

      "label": "Designed by an Occupational Therapist.\nFirst & Then is a very simple app that uses a board with photos to show that one activity must happen before the next can occur. A fantastic tool for visual learners! \n\nThe idea behind a First & Then board is to encourage a child to complete an activity that they don’t particularly enjoy. The board motivates the child to engage in a less preferred activity, knowing that a preferred activity (or a reward) will follow. For example, the ‘first’ activity may be something such as handwriting, homework, eating vegetables, using the toilet or visiting the dentist. The ‘then’ activity may be playing outside, computer time or a chocolate treat. \n\nThe App is extremely simple to use, the board is set up from one page, with clear prompts to help along the way. \n\nThe app allows the user to quickly and simply insert photos from the device’s camera or photo library, meaning that ‘First & Then’ boards can be made on-the-go and with little fuss.  Photos taken are saved within the App to use again and again.\n\nThe app includes a coloured visual timer, that the user can choose to use, to show the child how long they need to spend on an activity. As well as a digital display, the time is also represented by a coloured pie chart. When the pie is green, the child needs to keep going. When the pie turns amber, the child needs to get ready to finish. The pie turns red when it is time to stop the activity.\n\nThe app also includes a ‘Finished box’. The child can drag the photo into this box when the activity is completed. \n\nThe App is complete with the option to use exciting tones to reward the child for completing the activity."

Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "**The Zones of Regulation is a recipient of the prestigious Mom’s Choice Award\n**Seen on The History Channel & Bio Network\n\nThe Zones of Regulation (www.zonesofregulation.com) is a framework for thinking as well as a curriculum geared toward helping students gain skills in consciously regulating their behaviors, including the management of their emotions and level of alertness. This, in turn, leads to increased self-control and problem solving abilities.  \n\nIntroducing the new Zones Picture Studio!  Team up and learn emotional awareness by taking pictures with your device. Scenarios are presented to students providing them the opportunity to reflect on how the scenario would make their body feel. Thinking about the cues from their body and brain, students use the app to capture what the feeling looks like on them, gaining insights on the physiological cues that accompany emotions. All pictures will be taken with your device's camera, stored on your device, and displayed directly in the app for easy review. Students can even create their own scenarios. The new Zones Picture Studio offers hours upon hours of fun and education. \n\nLeah Kuypers is the author of the book, The Zones of Regulation (2011, Social Thinking Publishing).  The Zones of Regulation was featured as a promising practice in Attention Magazine and is being implemented school wide in districts across the United States and Canada.\n\nThe Zones assists students in conceptualizing how they are feeling by creating a system to categorize their emotions and levels of alertness into one of four zones.  Using a cognitive behavior approach, the App's learning activities are designed to help students recognize when they are in different zones, with each of the four zones represented by a different color.  \n\nThe Zones is designed to be used with elementary students, secondary students, and adults.  \n\nThroughout the App, students learn how to use strategies or tools to manage their feelings and behaviors in each zone.  Given each student's needs and preferences are unique, students explore various calming techniques, cognitive strategies, and sensory supports, building a toolbox of methods to use to regulate and move between zones.  \n\nHowever, self-regulation takes a lot more than knowing about tools.  To deepen students' understanding of how to self-regulate, the App also explores how triggers or different events can impact how they are feeling.  \n\nThe App highlights how to read others' facial expressions and recognize a broader range of emotions and perspectives about how others see and react to their behavior, insight into events that trigger their different zones, and when and how to use tools and problem solving skills to change the way they are thinking and feeling.\n\nThe App provides a fun, and engaging experience while learning and gaining valuable knowledge to assist in developing real-life skills.  Students will be taken on an adventure throughout a town filled with excitement, rewards, and mini games.  \n\nTo enhance learning, it is recommended that an adult closely monitor the student's progression through the App, asking probing questions and facilitating discussions about how the App's content can be generalized to the student's real life.  The content of the App can be further explored using the lessons and learning activities featured in the curriculum book, The Zones of Regulation.\n\nDownload The Zones of Regulation today!"

      "label": "What is the CSCS Test?\n\nIn order to obtain a CSCS card, candidates must pass the CSCS Test, also known as the CITB Health, Safety and Environment Test (HS&E test). This test is administered by the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB), an organization which is the contracted by the CSCS to handle assessments, card applications and enquiries from potential candidates. Each year, the CITB handles hundreds of thousands of CSCS card applications on behalf of the CSCS.\n\nHow many questions are there in the CSCS Test?\n\nThe test consists of 50 questions. These will be selected randomly from a database of hundreds of official CITB questions from the key areas mentioned above. Like the real exam, the CSCS mock test above and all of the practice tests that we provide as part of our revision material consist of 50 questions.\n\nWhat is the duration of the test?\n\nThe CSCS test is a timed assessment. You will have 45 minutes to complete the test. A countdown timer in the corner of your screen will indicate how much time you have left. You should have ample time to answer each question and double check them before finishing. It is important that you take your time and read each question carefully. If you spend an equal amount of time on each question, you will have just under a minute to answer each question.\n\nLike the official test, the CSCS mock test above is also timed and you will have exactly 45 minutes to complete it. Our software also features a pause option allowing you to stop the timer if you need extra time to think about questions and answers. Please note that you won’t have this option in your real test.\n\nWhat is the pass mark?\n\nThe pass mark for operatives and specialists is 45/50 (90%). The pass mark for managers and professionals is 46/50 (92%).\n\nWhat are some tips to pass the test?\n\nMake sure you get enough practice in and do plenty of revision in the weeks leading up to the test. Our practice and revision material has everything you need to pass the exam with flying colors.\nBefore you start the test, you will be given some time to get a feel of the computer software and user interface. Spend this time wisely and ask a member of staff if you’re unsure about anything.\nAfter starting the test, ensure you read the carefully and understand what it is asking. Read the question more than once.\nEnsure you choose an answer for each question. If you’re not sure about an answer, take an educated guess and choose an option that you feel may be correct. Don’t leave any unanswered questions.\nMake efficient use of your time. Remember you have 45 minutes to complete 50 questions. It is wise to spend an equal amount of time on each question. If you spend 45 seconds or less on each question, you will still have time at the end of your test to go through your answers and double check them.\nDon’t waste too much time on a question you’re struggling with. If you’re finding a question difficult, leave it and come back to it at a later stage.\n\nThe test consists of 50 knowledge questions.\n\nPrior to this date, the test also contained behavioral case study questions. These questions have since been removed and the scoring mechanism is now easier to understand.\n\nThe test is made up 50 questions, which consist of knowledge questions. You can score of a maximum of 50 points for the test.\n \nThere are 16 categories spanning 5 key sections. These 16 categories are:\n \nA: Legal and management:\n\tAccident reporting and recording\n\tGeneral responsibilities\n\nB: Health and welfare:\n\tDust and fumes (Respiratory hazards)\n\tFirst aid and emergency procedures\n\tHazardous substances\n\tHealth and welfare\n\tManual handling\n\tNoise and vibration\n\tPersonal protective equipment\n\nC: General safety:\n\tElectrical safety, tools and equipment\n\tFire prevention and control\n\tSafety signs\n\tSite transport safety and lifting operations\n\nD: High risk activities:\n\tExcavations and confined spaces\n\tWorking at height\n\nE: Environment:\n\tEnvironmental awareness and waste control"

But Sanskrit is a very complex and demanding language, and in order to master it, one must memorise a great deal of information. This is where Liberation Philology Sanskrit can help.\n\nWhenever you have your phone and a free moment, Liberation Philology Sanskrit presents a continuous multiple-choice test on Sanskrit vocabulary and grammar. It immediately confirms or corrects each answer, and reinforces your knowledge through repetition.\n\n• Vocabulary: 320 levels, each testing the translation of ten words between Sanskrit and English. Interspersed among these are cumulative levels reviewing what has been learned earlier (giving a total of 360 levels).\n\n• Nouns: Tests your ability to parse and decline all classes of Sanskrit nouns.\n\n• Pronouns: Tests your ability to parse and decline Sanskrit pronouns.\n\n• Verbs: Tests your ability to parse and conjugate a wide range of Sanskrit verbs.\n\nAll three tests can be set to display Sanskrit words either in Devanagari script or transliterated into the Roman alphabet. A further Reference module allows you to review the vocabulary word-list and the noun and verb paradigms."

Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more.

Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Math problems are presented at the top of the game screen. Feedback is presented at the bottom of the game screen. Correct solutions to problems answered incorrectly will be displayed. \n\nScoring\nThe score in Math Bingo is determined by the time to complete a game plus a two second penalty for each problem answered incorrectly. \n\nExample:\nTime to complete game 0:45 seconds\nIncorrect answers: 3\nScore: 45+6=51 \n\nPlayer Profiles\nMath Bingo saves player information with custom player profiles. Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles. \n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE Math BINGO:\n- Does not contain third-party ads. \n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks. \n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools. \n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store. \n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit: http://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n ---------------------------"

      "label": "All our hugely popular songs from Jolly Phonics are now available in one fun app, which includes the actions too! Children will love learning their letter sounds by singing along to the Jolly Songs and doing the actions. Being able to identify the letter sounds in words will help them with both their reading and writing. This app will entertain the whole family or school classroom.\n\n• Easily switch between British or American English and Precursive or Print letter fonts.\n\n• There's a highlighter option to track each word as it is sung, helping the child to read. This can also be switched off.\n\n• Autoplay option available from the info page\n\n• Includes the vowels song.\n\n• Includes a description and an image for each of the Jolly Phonics actions.\n\n• Easy to use navigation to quickly find the song you want to play.\n\n• With beautiful illustrations from our Jolly Songs book.\n\n• Includes an index of all the songs.\n\n\nFor customers experiencing problems with sound first check that the side switch is not activated (you should not see a red dot on the switch). Then ensure the volume is turned up. Now open the app. If you still hear no sound at this point, swipe up from the very bottom of your screen and when you see the arrow swipe up again to pull up the on-screen menu pages. Ensure you are on the first menu page and if you see a red button with a bell and a line through it this is means your ringer is set to mute and is why you cannot hear any sound in our app. Simply touch the button to turn the sound back on. Now swipe down on the menu to return to the app and you should now hear sound when you play a song.

While created with and for people with autism, it can be used by anyone with a speech disability or delay. Grace App is designed to be owned and updated by the user, with minimum support from care-givers.\n\nGrace App works by offering a selection of images in categorized folders where users can select a picture to add to the “sentence strip”. The user then shares the sentence with their communication partner who helps them to point to each card, reading the words aloud.\n\nThe default setting is for no sound; however, there is an option in Settings to select “Tap Card to Speak” for users who prefer a vocal output.\n\nOn handhelds such as iPod touch or iPhone, the device can be rotated to landscape to show a fullscreen sentence view for sharing and pointing. On iPad, simply tap the arrow to enlarge the sentence to fullscreen. There's also a choice of 3 card sizes for user preference and those with visual/mobility impairment.\n\nCategory folders contain a selection of pre-loaded images. Users can add their own images using the camera or access any saved and stored images in their photo library, including images saved from the web.\n\nAll images can be labeled with text, deleted, or rearranged to suit the individual user. You can add new Category folders, with a selection of your own photos. All Categories can be rearranged and renamed as required. Detailed instructions are available in the Guide to Grace App at http://www.graceapp.com.\n\nUsers can also learn about therapeutic strategies for developing other communication goals in the Guide. These include accepting and expressing “No, Wait” and “Asking for Help” There is also a section on communicating pain.\n\nGrace App has been reviewed by senior speech and language therapists who say:\n\n“Grace App is easy and quick to use and set up, it's easy to rename photo labels. Grace App is my favourite AAC app\". KM - Speech and Language Therapist.\n\n\"I use Grace App with some of my clients who have difficulty communicating and need a system to augment their speech. One client, a school-aged child with Down Syndrome who has difficulty expressing himself using speech loves Grace App. Within a matter of minutes he was independently requesting his snack AND saying the word. In his case, the voice output was not activated, as he was more motivated to say the words and my goal is ultimately speech production. However, for some of my clients Vocal Output would be very beneficial. I also love the support you get from the developer – you don’t always get this with communication apps. Grace App is simple to use, easy to edit, and very effective as a communication device. The pictures are very easy to take on the spot, and now also very easy to label (every speech therapist’s dream). I also use it along with sign language – a true total communication approach! Grace App is a simple and genius app.” MM - Speech and Language Pathologist. \n\nGrace App is continually improved with the feedback and help of users world-wide.

Our aim is to provide a comprehensive ISL dictionary system in an easy-to-use form.\n\n---------------\nFeatures\n---------------\n\nEach sign contained within Concise ISL is presented in video form and accompanied by high quality images of the component signs for each hand.\n\nAll signs can be sorted by category, an organisational approach chosen to support learning. \n\nSpecific words and categories can be easily found within Concise ISL, using a simple and efficient search interface, swipe gestures, sliding menus and other intuitive interaction mechanisms.\n\nThis app is designed to be child-appropriate, with the inclusion of a large number of signs in categories such as Animals, Colours, Food, Sports and many others.\n\nThrough the inclusion of signs such as \"texting\", \"tablet\", \"facebook\" and many more, this ISL dictionary reflects the modern context of the language.\n\nConcise ISL currently includes approximately 1000 signs, a figure which we have continuously strived to increase.\n\nConcise ISL supports offline use. A data connection is required to download signs for the first time. These videos are then stored on-device for subsequent viewing offline. This approach allows the inclusion of such a large number of signs without imposing the consumption of a significant amount of on-device memory on all users. The video size has been carefully calculated to reduce bandwidth consumption.\n\nConcise ISL also includes a number of additional sections containing information concerning the history of ISL, the grammatical structure of the language and more.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using Concise ISL!\n\nKevin & Micheál"

Being able to identify the letter sounds in words will help them with both their reading and writing. This app will entertain the whole family or school classroom.\n\n• Easily switch between British or American English and Precursive or Print letter fonts.\n\n• There's a highlighter option to track each word as it is sung, helping the child to read. This can also be switched off.\n\n• Autoplay option available from the info page\n\n• Includes the vowels song.\n\n• Includes a description and an image for each of the Jolly Phonics actions.\n\n• Easy to use navigation to quickly find the song you want to play.\n\n• With beautiful illustrations from our Jolly Songs book.\n\n• Includes an index of all the songs.\n\n\nFor customers experiencing problems with sound first check that the side switch is not activated (you should not see a red dot on the switch). Then ensure the volume is turned up. Now open the app. If you still hear no sound at this point, swipe up from the very bottom of your screen and when you see the arrow swipe up again to pull up the on-screen menu pages. Ensure you are on the first menu page and if you see a red button with a bell and a line through it this is means your ringer is set to mute and is why you cannot hear any sound in our app. Simply touch the button to turn the sound back on. Now swipe down on the menu to return to the app and you should now hear sound when you play a song.

      "label": "**The Zones of Regulation is a recipient of the prestigious Mom’s Choice Award\n**Seen on The History Channel & Bio Network\n\nThe Zones of Regulation (www.zonesofregulation.com) is a framework for thinking as well as a curriculum geared toward helping students gain skills in consciously regulating their behaviors, including the management of their emotions and level of alertness. This, in turn, leads to increased self-control and problem solving abilities.  \n\nIntroducing the new Zones Picture Studio!  Team up and learn emotional awareness by taking pictures with your device. Scenarios are presented to students providing them the opportunity to reflect on how the scenario would make their body feel. Thinking about the cues from their body and brain, students use the app to capture what the feeling looks like on them, gaining insights on the physiological cues that accompany emotions. All pictures will be taken with your device's camera, stored on your device, and displayed directly in the app for easy review. Students can even create their own scenarios. The new Zones Picture Studio offers hours upon hours of fun and education. \n\nLeah Kuypers is the author of the book, The Zones of Regulation (2011, Social Thinking Publishing).  The Zones of Regulation was featured as a promising practice in Attention Magazine and is being implemented school wide in districts across the United States and Canada.\n\nThe Zones assists students in conceptualizing how they are feeling by creating a system to categorize their emotions and levels of alertness into one of four zones.  Using a cognitive behavior approach, the App's learning activities are designed to help students recognize when they are in different zones, with each of the four zones represented by a different color.  \n\nThe Zones is designed to be used with elementary students, secondary students, and adults.  \n\nThroughout the App, students learn how to use strategies or tools to manage their feelings and behaviors in each zone.  Given each student's needs and preferences are unique, students explore various calming techniques, cognitive strategies, and sensory supports, building a toolbox of methods to use to regulate and move between zones.  \n\nHowever, self-regulation takes a lot more than knowing about tools.  To deepen students' understanding of how to self-regulate, the App also explores how triggers or different events can impact how they are feeling.  \n\nThe App highlights how to read others' facial expressions and recognize a broader range of emotions and perspectives about how others see and react to their behavior, insight into events that trigger their different zones, and when and how to use tools and problem solving skills to change the way they are thinking and feeling.\n\nThe App provides a fun, and engaging experience while learning and gaining valuable knowledge to assist in developing real-life skills.  Students will be taken on an adventure throughout a town filled with excitement, rewards, and mini games.  \n\nTo enhance learning, it is recommended that an adult closely monitor the student's progression through the App, asking probing questions and facilitating discussions about how the App's content can be generalized to the student's real life.  The content of the App can be further explored using the lessons and learning activities featured in the curriculum book, The Zones of Regulation.\n\nDownload The Zones of Regulation today!"

Then they can go to work at the harbour, play with the crane and unload ships.\n\nFRANCE\nIn venerable France, for example, children can sit in the evening in a chic café on the Seine under the Eiffel Tower, or they can play robber and gendarme with the police. Of course there is also a police helicopter, a police boat and a police car.\n\nINDIA\nIn densely populated India, the children can harvest tropical fruits and squeeze juices, change tires in the Auto Werkstadt, ride an elephant or work on the latest robot technology. What is particularly exciting here are the clear contrasts between tradition and technology.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE APP\n- Discover a huge world\n- Switch between day and night mode\n- Go on a treasure hunt, sail the pirate ship\n- Ride an elephant, dinosaur \n- Play with a robot or with a huge skeleton\n- Fell trees and use the wood to make a fire\n- Disguise yourself\n- plant flowers and vegetables\n- Change the wheels of all cars\n- Bake a cake\n- Fly a helicopter, a jet, a historic aircraft, a hot air balloon or a U.F.O.\n- have a picnic on the beach - deliver packages\n- Send postcards around the world\n- Discover souvenirs from all over the world in Fiete's room\n\nIMPROVE CHILDREN\n- Fantasy role playing games\n- Telling your own stories\n- Experiment\n- Interaction with others\n- Understanding the world\n- Open-mindedness\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Ahoiii, a small app development studio from Cologne.

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

Thank\nyou” - Chattity\n\nSound Touch is the #1 app for entertaining and engaging young children -- complete with\nanimal sounds and music.\n\nStimulate children's brains and teach them all at the same time.\n\nListen to the sounds that farm animals, pets and other wildlife make in nature by touching\nwhimsical cartoons. Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

      "label": "Grace App - winner of the 2010 Irish Web Awards and United Nations World Summit Award Mobile.\n\n* * * *\n\nGrace App is an evidence-based picture exchange app designed to encourage and reward independent communication through the use of images. While created with and for people with autism, it can be used by anyone with a speech disability or delay. Grace App is designed to be owned and updated by the user, with minimum support from care-givers.\n\nGrace App works by offering a selection of images in categorized folders where users can select a picture to add to the “sentence strip”. The user then shares the sentence with their communication partner who helps them to point to each card, reading the words aloud.\n\nThe default setting is for no sound; however, there is an option in Settings to select “Tap Card to Speak” for users who prefer a vocal output.\n\nOn handhelds such as iPod touch or iPhone, the device can be rotated to landscape to show a fullscreen sentence view for sharing and pointing. On iPad, simply tap the arrow to enlarge the sentence to fullscreen. There's also a choice of 3 card sizes for user preference and those with visual/mobility impairment.\n\nCategory folders contain a selection of pre-loaded images. Users can add their own images using the camera or access any saved and stored images in their photo library, including images saved from the web.\n\nAll images can be labeled with text, deleted, or rearranged to suit the individual user. You can add new Category folders, with a selection of your own photos. All Categories can be rearranged and renamed as required. Detailed instructions are available in the Guide to Grace App at http://www.graceapp.com.\n\nUsers can also learn about therapeutic strategies for developing other communication goals in the Guide. These include accepting and expressing “No, Wait” and “Asking for Help” There is also a section on communicating pain.\n\nGrace App has been reviewed by senior speech and language therapists who say:\n\n“Grace App is easy and quick to use and set up, it's easy to rename photo labels. Grace App is my favourite AAC app\". KM - Speech and Language Therapist.\n\n\"I use Grace App with some of my clients who have difficulty communicating and need a system to augment their speech. One client, a school-aged child with Down Syndrome who has difficulty expressing himself using speech loves Grace App. Within a matter of minutes he was independently requesting his snack AND saying the word. In his case, the voice output was not activated, as he was more motivated to say the words and my goal is ultimately speech production. However, for some of my clients Vocal Output would be very beneficial. I also love the support you get from the developer – you don’t always get this with communication apps. Grace App is simple to use, easy to edit, and very effective as a communication device. The pictures are very easy to take on the spot, and now also very easy to label (every speech therapist’s dream). I also use it along with sign language – a true total communication approach! Grace App is a simple and genius app.” MM - Speech and Language Pathologist. \n\nGrace App is continually improved with the feedback and help of users world-wide. If you have any suggestions or need support, please contact us at http://www.graceapp.com.\n\nPlease leave a review if you think Grace has been helpful to you or your family!\n\n* * * *\n\nGrace App Communication is a member of Moms with Apps, a collaborative group of family-friendly developers seeking to promote quality apps for kids and families.\n\nRecommended Ages: Suitable for all ages, parents and caregivers. Currently available in English, French, German, Spanish, Danish, Portuguese, Arabic and Italian.\n\nDiscounts are available through Apple’s educational Volume Purchase Program.\n\n\"Easy Lemon (60 second)\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com).\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"

Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

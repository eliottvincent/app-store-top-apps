Simply enter the details of the steps and times for the items in your meal and the app will calculate when each step needs to start. \n\n\nFEATURES\n========\nYou can start cooking immediately or choose a meal end time. The timers run in the background so you can turn off your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch or use other apps while your meal is cooking.\n\nCooking timer:\n• Displays a timer for each step in your meal, showing when the step will start.\n• Quickly see when the meal will be ready and when the next step will start.\n• Audio and visual alerts warn you when a step needs to be performed.\n• Hands-free operation to avoid getting your screen dirty.\n\nManage your meals:\n• Store the details for as many different meals as you want.\n• Need to eat by 6pm?

I looked at several different apps which claimed to do similar kind of thing, but none had depth of functionality, nor the ease of use and streamlined interface of this one.\" — littlesquidge, UK.\n\n***** \"Best cooking timer I can find, with clear sequential steps throughout the whole process!\" — Midamoor, UK.\n\n***** \"It does one thing and one thing well and is probably the best 'kitchen' timer on the App Store for cooking.\" — Orca1910, UK.\n\n***** \"Excellent app, very simple to set up and has multiple stages built in. Visually clear and perfect for a big meal like Christmas.\" — BT2203, Ireland.\n\n\nIf you would like more information please visit https://hacknicity.com/easycookingtimer where you can read the User Guide and a Tutorial to get a feel for how the app works before you buy."

      "label": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription. The subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the subscription period. There is no increase in price when renewing.

      "label": "Caveman Feast for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch contains 250 delicious Paleo recipes that are beautifully illustrated and easy to follow.\n\nThere's nothing really revolutionary about the Paleo diet. It's what our grandma's have been telling us for years: \"Eat real foods that are healthy, avoid highly processed factory foods and you'll feel better and live happier\".\n\nWhether you call it Paleo, real food, low carb, low sugar, grain-free, gluten-free ancestral, nutrient-dense, primal or whole food - the important thing is that the Paleo diet is a healthier way of eating. The list of benefits people have reported is enormous: \n● Weight loss ● More energy that doesn't vary wildly throughout the day ● Improved sleep ● Clearer skin ● Better digestion ● Improved fitness ● Reduced allergies. The list goes on but it's better to try it for yourself.\n\nThe 250 Paleo recipes included will help satisfy your cravings for delicious, healthy food. Inside Caveman Feast you'll find healthy breakfasts, filling main meals, tasty desserts, side dishes and snacks. \n\nRecipes include:\n● Perfect paleo burger\n● Paleo french toast\n● Healthy caveman cookies \n● Blueberry espresso brownies\n● Grilled buffalo shrimp\n● Smoked avocado lime pork chops\n● Apple dijon burgers\n● Homemade healthy mayonnaise\n● Caveman crunch bars\n● Sweet potato pasta\n● Beasty BBQ sauce\n● Caveman shepherd's pie\n\nFeatures in the app include:\n● Add recipes to your shopping list and see it organised by aisle, saving time at the grocery store\n● Track your calories and macros with our nutritional data\n● Increase or decrease recipe servings\n● Search by ingredient\n● Add notes to recipes\n● Share recipes with friends\n● Switch the measurement units\n● Plan a week of meals\n● Tick off your shopping list on your Apple Watch\n● Integrated with Apple Health\n\nThe quick and easy to follow recipes are by New York Times bestselling author George Bryant of civilizedcavemancooking.com. After decades in a constant battle with his weight and nearly losing both his legs while on deployment as a U.S. Marine, George decided to change his life. He went Paleo. What started as a simple website to share recipes with friends, has since grown into an award-winning food blog. After being in the Marines for 12 years, George now enjoys creating delicious Paleo recipes full-time, hoping to change as many lives as he can with real food recipes.\n\nGeorge works in collaboration with Abel James from the chart topping podcast \"The Fat-Burning Man show\" where he covers the Paleo lifestyle. Abel has been featured in Men's Health, Popular Science and Wired Magazine. You'll find exclusive content from Abel inside the app.\n\nNote: For users upgrading\nCaveman Feast 3.0 is available as a free update on iOS 9.3 and above. Our previous 50 recipe in app purchase has been unlocked for everyone. We've added a new 60 recipe pack which can be added through a one off in app purchase.\n\nNote: Optional Meal Planner Pro Subscription\nMeal Planner Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

Also remember to select the thickness of the edges and the bottom. A difference of a few millimetres will result in errors of several tens of grams.\n\n3 - Place the phone on the container.\n\n4 - Use your fingers to choose the diameter, making it match that of the container.\n\n5 - Place the phone next to the container and use your finger to choose the level of the measurement. If your phone has a cover, remove it, otherwise SUBTRACT the thickness of the cover from the thickness of the edge.\n\n6 - At this point you'll get the grams or millilitres if you are measuring a liquid.\n\nFor the first few times check the measurements, just to get started. Measurements made with this application are only approximate. They are quite precise, but they cannot be compared to measurements on scales."

Dukan Diet Pro provides hundreds of dukan food recipes to help you lose weight and to keep it off. \n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\"This is not just the best app I have ever come cross but this is the most comprehensive directory of amazing, interesting, fruitful, exciting dukan recipes I have ever come across. I would of paid 100 pounds for this had I know the contents before purchasing. I can tell LOADS of work has gone into this and you are sharing some amazing energy for little. Well well done. Thank you so much.\"\n- Michael Todd, Director of the UKH Gro\n\n\"I love this app! So many recipes!\"\n- Serge Gobachev \n\n\"Lost two lbs in four days!\"\n- Andrea Ward\n\n\"Awesome dishes. Even my super picky boyfriend loves them!\"\n- Aja Chism\n\n\"I bought this app and it's amazing! Just reading the recipes is getting me hungry, yum. It's easy to follow and I'm gonna try one of the beef recipes for lunch. Thnx! I Love it :)\"\n- Jasmine Ogana\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe only thing that matters when it comes to diet plans is if it works!\n\nBased on over 20 years of research the Dukan Diet is one of the most popular books and diet plans in France. It is a protein-based diet designed by French nutritionist and dietician, Pierre Dukan.\n\nThe diet consists of 4 phases: attack, cruise, consolidation, and stabilization.\n\nThe attack phase is designed to enable dieters to rapidly lose 2 to 3 kilograms (4.4 to 6.6 lb) in 2–7 days by kick-starting their metabolism. Dieters are allowed to eat as much as they want of 72 protein-rich foods.\n\nThe cruise phase is designed to allow dieters to more gradually achieve the weight they aim for by eating protein-rich foods with the addition of 28 specific vegetables. \n\nThe consolidation phase is designed to help in preventing any future massive weight gain. During this phase, fruit, bread, cheese and starchy foods are reintroduced into a normal diet, leaving two celebratory meals a week as directed by the plan.\n\nFinally, in the stabilization phase, dieters can essentially eat whatever they want without gaining weight by following a few lifestyle rules: protein day once a week, eating oat bran every day and making a fitness commitment to \"take the stairs\". Dieters should follow this last phase for the rest of their life to avoid regaining weight.\n\n- Features an elegant and intuitive interface\n\n- Over 300 dukan food recipes\n\n- Recipes for all meal types including: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack\n\n- Star your favorites for easy reference\n\n- Filter menu to sort\n\n- Search feature to quickly find your favorite recipe\n\nDownload Dukan Diet Pro and start feeling healthier today!"

      "label": "How many of us struggle with \"kitchen math?\" The Kitchen Calculator PRO app makes cooking and measuring so much easier. Kitchen Calculator PRO does all the recipe conversions for you, and makes it simple to scale recipes up (or down) to change the number of servings the recipe yields. With Kitchen Calculator PRO you can:\n\n1.Quickly scale your recipes (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using fractions!\n\n2.Convert ingredients from weight to volume, and vice versa ( cups to grams, ounces,  etc. )\n\n3.Supports several volume, weight, distance, and temperature conversions\n\n4.Enter amounts and view results in standard cooking fractions (1/2, 1/3, etc )\n\n5.Grow a database with your favorite ingredients! (see weight to volume )\n\n\nUSER COMMENTS\n\n***** Exactly what I've been looking for! - \"I just tested this out on a new cake recipe and it was simple, easy and accurate. The cake came out *perfect*!\" by njanehair.\n\n***** Yippee, perfection! - \"I cook 3 meals a day for my toddler and am always needing to scale recipes down so I'm not making ridiculous amounts of food\" by Cindi M.\n\n***** Brilliant - \"For a cook trained in the metric system, this tool is a dream come true\" by BeeDiana.\n\n\nSCALE YOUR RECIPES\n\nEasily convert and scale recipes in an instant. Doubling a recipe (or cutting a recipe in half) is simpler than ever before, with all the most common units of cooking measurement right at your fingertips. \n\n\nWEIGHT TO VOLUME CONVERSIONS\n\nWhat is so special about weight to volume conversions?\n\nWhen converting from weight to volume it is important to take into account the ingredient you are converting. As you know, a cup of sugar does not weigh the same as a cup of rice. Furthermore, a particular brand of sugar may weigh different from another.  This is all made easy with Kitchen Calculator PRO.\n\nSo, how does Kitchen Calculator handle weight to volume conversions?\n\n1.It comes with a database of common ingredients based on weight figures from the USDA (US Department of Agriculture).\n\n2.It allows you to quickly enter and save your own ingredient weight for more precise conversions.  In many cases, you can enter the values right off the product label, using fractions!  \n\n3.Kitchen Calculator will remember any saved ingredient information for future conversions.\n\nNOTE: The preset ingredient list is based on USDA  (US Department of Agriculture) figures and are approximate values. They may differ from the ingredients you use. For precise calculations we recommend entering the weights for your ingredients and, whenever possible using a scale.\n\nINGREDIENT DATA SOURCE\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 2007. USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 21. Nutrient Data Laboratory Home Page, http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata Note: Release numbers change as new versions are released.\n\nPLEASE LET US KNOW OF ANY ENHANCEMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE.\n\nFOR SUPPORT EMAIL: info@kitchencalculator.net"

We used the rule of thumb that women need 2000 calories and men need 2400 calories per normal day and on a Fast Day you should eat a quarter of a normal day’s recommended calories.\n\nBut these normal values are just estimates, to get the maximum out of the 5:2 Fast Diet you should consume a quarter of the calories needed to maintain your particular weight. This value is different for each person because it takes into account your gender, age, weight, height & normal activity level.\n\nOur calculator app will allow you to more accurately work out your Rest Day Calorie Intake and therefore your more accurate Fast Day intake."

      "label": "Sugar is in everything these days, from boxed cereals to pasta sauces; it's almost impossible to avoid unless you're eating a real food diet. The 7 Day Sugar-Free Detox was designed by the Young and Raw team of expert nutritionists and holistic health coaches to create a fun and cleansing experience for you while you break free from the chains of sugar. \n\nStudies show sugar can be highly addictive, so rest assured we've got your back when it comes to kicking it for good! Inside this detox, you're going to find two meal plans to choose from. Our Low-Sugar Plan has small amounts of natural sugar found in fruits. Our No-Sugar Plan is completely sugar free.\n\nRefined or processed sugar is incomplete in its nutrient profile, lacking minerals and vitamins required by our bodies for digestion. What ends up happening when we eat sugar, is our bodies have to seek out the proper minerals required for digestion and unfortunately, those minerals are \"borrowed\" from our mineral reserves. This can lead to mineral deficiency and other health issues that are today, considered \"modern diseases\". \n\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox is designed to support:\n- Breaking sugar addiction\n- Weight loss\n- Liver & Kidney detox\n- Skin health \n- Balancing blood sugar \n- Mood balancing\n- Energy levels\n- Adrenal fatigue\n\nInside the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox you will find:\n- Low-Sugar Meal Plan which includes some fruit sugars\n- No-Sugar Meal Plan which is 100% sugar free\n- Recipes - along with a list of health benefits for each recipe\n- Shopping lists - to make shopping quick and easy, you can tick off items from the list\n- Morning and evening routines - including how to get a perfect night of sleep\n- Young and Raw's favorite books, quotes & documentaries\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the plan work to reset the body?\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox was carefully crafted by experts to get you results while maintaining your sanity throughout the process! \n\nBy replacing sugar with fresh leafy greens, vegetables, seaweeds and seeds along with an abundance of healthy fats, your body will be less hungry for sugar. In the beginning, you may notice a withdrawal period as your body adjusts to running off of fat and real food rather than sugar and carbohydrates. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, it's not easy, but we know you can do it!\n\nThe meal plans have everything you need to detox, and because there are no added or refined sugars your liver and kidneys will get a much needed break from processed sugar.\n\nFor 7 days you're going to experience what it's like to enjoy only real, whole foods but don't forget that diet is only one part of the equation. Proper detox also includes getting enough fresh clean water and optimizing your sleep. Our sleep cycles ensure the body gets its time to effectively detox, renew and heal. The included sleep protocol was designed based on all of the information we have about the importance of optimized sleep and the experiments we have done, to create a protocol that really works. \n\nYour herbal protocol is always optional and if you're on any medications, pregnant or have a health condition, it's advised that you speak with your physician and consult an herbalist prior to taking new supplements. The herbal protocol is minimal yet powerful, including some of the most elite herbs for detoxing the liver, kidneys, creating clear skin and boosting energy in the process. \n\nIn Summary, the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox helps to reset the body by:\n- Gently cleansing the body and promoting toxin elimination\n- Gently introducing blood cleansing foods\n- Providing the body with enough healthy fats to begin removing a reliance upon sugar and processed carbohydrates\n- Encouraging a healthy sleep cycle \n- Creates a movement routine to stimulate the lymphatic system, the endocrine system and the detox organs\n- Hydrating effectively to flush the body of excess toxins and create electrolyte balance"

      "label": "Version 3 has a new Search facility that uses Machine Learning to generate possible results. \n\nYou take a photo of a plant you are trying to identify. You submit it to the the Search Engine and it provides possible foods it could be.  Much easier to use than the older search facility.  You can take multiple photos and see all results provided to aid your assessment of what the food is.\n\nHow many times have you been out and about in the countryside looked at a plant and wondered was it edible or not?  Well, if you are into the idea of free food then probably quite a lot.  But how many times have you had the foraging guidebook on you?  The answer, if you are me, is never when you see something interesting that you think you know what it is but are not sure.  But, how many times have you had your mobile phone on you?  Probably every time.  And finally after finding that special spot where the item grows how many times have you then been unable to find it again?  Probably quite a lot.  It could be in the middle of a wood or large wasteground.\n\nSo what is the solution?  This App that's what.  The App combines a list of the most common wild foods available in the UK (many of these plants grow outside of the UK as well), images of those foods and information about the food such as leaf, flower and stem identification information, habitat, season, uses and most importantly any warnings about the plant.  You can also record the locations of the foods found on the Maps so that you can find them again.\n\nEach food has the following information: Description, Habitat, Season, Uses and Warnings; a minimum of two images to aid in identification; notes to record your information about the food; a set of user specified locations shown on the Map.\n\nEach Food can be identified using the images and the description.  Once identified you can also record the location of the food found.  \n\nLocation use the inbuilt GPS or WiFi to locate you on the Map.  Obviously, the GPS can work anywhere whereas WiFi location is less accurate and not always available (especially in the middle of a wood).  Maps require an internet connection and a working data plan.\n\nYou can record you own notes about a food in general and you can also record notes about individual saved food locations.\n\nThere's also a Search facility to help you identify a food.  You may be looking at a plant with white flowers or a toothed leaf or both.  You can use the Search to look for those foods with white flowers or toothed leaves or white flowers and toothed leaves.  The list of foods changes when you search to show only those that satisfy the search.  Using the right combination of search terms could reveal an exact match."

We'd love to help you get cooking!***\n\n#1 Food & Drink App and featured as one of Apple's \"Best New Apps\"!\n\nIt’s the Webby Award-winning app from Michelle Tam and Henry Fong, the James Beard Award nominated creators of Nom Nom Paleo—now available for both iPad and iPhone! Michelle and Henry’s Saveur Award winning food blog and New York Times bestselling cookbook are just the tip of the iceberg—this newly updated app makes cooking even more fun and inspirational, and takes all the guesswork out of cooking. Plus, now that the Nom Nom Paleo app’s available for iPhone, you can take these nomtastic recipes with you anywhere!\n\nFeatures:\n \n● Over 145 simple, tantalizing recipes, all free of gluten, soy, and refined sugar, sortable by food category, searchable by ingredients and category—the vast majority of which are approved for the Whole30® nutritional re-set program. You’ll find lots of recipes that are exclusive to this app, and not available on the Nom Nom Paleo website or cookbook. \n\n● More recipes are being added regularly! You won’t have to wait until future app updates—new recipes can now be added automatically to the app on your device!\n\n● More than 2,000 stunning, high-resolution photos showing every step of the cooking process.\n\n● Fun and visually-engaging new user interface and design, including a home display that allows you to quickly scroll through and visually select recipes.\n\n● Simple-to-follow instructions, including tips, shortcuts, and information about food and techniques.\n\n● An interactive, email-friendly grocery list that syncs across devices and makes food shopping a breeze.\n\n● An extensive “Paleo 101” primer that explains the benefits of the “caveman” diet and provides resources for more information about ancestral health and nutrition.\n\n● A Whole30-friendly 30-day sample meal plan with links to recipes.\n\n● An in-depth shopping guide with product reviews and links to sources for cooking tools and ingredients.\n\n● The ability to bookmark recipes, create a personalized category of favorite recipes, and add notes.\n\n● A “constant-on” function to prevent the screen from dimming while you cook.\n  \n● The ability to email complete recipes and shopping lists.\n\nPraise for Nom Nom Paleo:\n\n● The “Martha Stewart of Paleo.” –The New York Times\n\n● “Oddly provocative.” –Christopher Kimball of America’s Test Kitchen\n\n● “A must-have app.” –AppCraver\n\n● “Brilliantly designed.” –Apps Magazine\n \n● “Visually stunning.” –Gear Diary\n\n● “Always popping with flavor.” –The Kitchn\n\n● “Truly extraordinary.” –Michael Ruhlman, James Beard Award-winning food writer\n \nMessage from Michelle of Nom Nom Paleo:\n\nHey, Nomsters – my updated cookbook app is here, and it’s finally available for your iPhone!\n\nThis “cookbook on steroids” is a uniquely immersive culinary experience. It’s a visual feast packed with brand new recipes, as well as updated versions of classic Nom Nom Paleo dishes—all presented with my own special brand of whimsically snarky commentary. Food lovers and busy home cooks can visually follow each of my recipes from the pantry to the dining room table.\n \nBut that’s not all! For those who want to learn more about the “caveman” approach to nutrition and health, I’ve included a “Paleo 101” primer that explains why we eat whole, unprocessed, real foods (like meat, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and nuts) and avoid highly-processed and pro-inflammatory foods. You’ll also find an in-depth shopping guide, a 30-day meal planner, an interactive shopping list, and much, much more.\n \nMy hope is that this app will delight, engage, and inspire you to eat well and be well!\n \n● App development by Y Media Labs ●"

      "label": "Steak Master – for the Perfect Steak   \n\n*******\n- Number 1 in the App Store Top 10 \"Food & Drink\" in Germany (2014, 2015, 2016)\n\n– Recommended by famous german newspapers including 'Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung', 'NZZ' or 'Lecker' (2014)\n\n- Tested and recommended by german TV Shows like 'SAT.1-Frühstücksfernsehen' or RTL2 'Schau dich schlau'\n*******\n\nSteak Master - Your steak companion    \n\nPreparing the perfect steak sure isn’t easy and needs a lot of experience, which not all of you have. The effects could be serious – you want the steak medium but it’s still dripping blood. Or your anticipated rare steak is overdone and tough as leather.\n\nBut, it doesn’t have to be that way. The Steak Master is easy to use and will help you cook your steaks just as you like them every time.\n\nThe perfect preparation of steaks with the Steak Master is simple:\n\n1. First, you determine the type of temperature scale on your oven’s temperature control knob by tapping on the configuration button. That is important, because the Steak Master needs this information in order to give you the correct oven temperature later on. You only have to do this once per oven.\n\n2. Decide if you want to use just a frying pan or both frying pan and oven (the professional way). Using only the frying pan is much quicker than the use of frying pan and oven. The meat never leaves the pan until it’s done, whereas the slightly longer expert’s way requires both frying pan and oven, but results in perfectly juicy steaks.  \n\n3. Most important: The thickness of the steak and how you would like to have your steak . The Steak Master helps you to define both. Just tap on the pictures or the controller under the pictures and select how well done you would like to have your steak. Then tap on „Thickness of steak“, hold the steak sideways next to your iPhone/iPod and measure its thickness with your index finger.\n\n4. Here we go! The Steak Master guides you step by step through the menu, tells you what you need and shows you what to do in chronological order. For example how much you have to heat up the butter/oil in your frying pan.\n\n5. When your butter/oil is slightly bubbling it’s time to sear the steak. The Steak Master counts down the time before you have to turn over the steak.\n\n6. After searing your meat you just follow the instructions the Steak Master is giving you. Did you choose the cooking with the frying pan, reduce the heat to the temperature the Steak Master states on the display and simply finish the cooking in the pan. How long you have to cook and how often you have to turn the meat – the Steak Master-App has got the answer! A small treat are the Steak-Spy and the Steak-O-Meter:  they show you the condition and the progress of the steak during the cooking phase until it‘s finished. Then take the meat out of the pan, wrap it up with tin foil and let it rest. How long? The Steak Master tells you automatically.\n\n7. If you decided to use a frying pan and the oven it’s the same method, only that you have to follow the additional instructions of the Steak-Master-App for the use of the oven. Either way you choose – the result is a perfectly cooked steak and a great meal. Enjoy!\n\nHighlights\n\n- The Steak-Master calculates from the thickness of the steak and the chosen steak result (e.g. rare or medium) exactly to the second the time the steak needs to cook.\n\n- The formula is based on hundreds of tests by experienced steak experts.\n\n- Fool-proof preparation: simply determine thickness of the steak, the way you would like to have the steak done and follow the illustrated instructions of the App step by step.\n\n- The Steak Spy shows you the inside of the steak during the cooking progress."

You use a simple interface to plan out meals like “Hamburgers on Thursday, Fish and Rice on Friday”. Recent meals are easily available or you can type in new items the first time you use them.\n\nMealPlan is a universal app, and will sync between your iPhone and iPad using either iCloud or Dropbox. Plan your meals on the iPad's big screen, and automatically have your grocery list with you on your phone. And access your grocery list from your Apple Watch.\n\nMealPlan creates your grocery list as you're planning meals. When you're done, tap the Grocery Basket to see the list, add new items, mark off items you already have, and then print it, email it, or sync it with your iPhone. This is a huge time saver!\n\nAnd, on the iPad, once you’ve used the app for a few weeks, the Magic Wand will help you quickly fill out subsequent weeks, with a quick suggestions interface.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Simple interface to plan out meals.\n- Keep track of recipes and the groceries they use.\n- Automatically generated grocery list based on your meal plan.\n- Save grocery lists for later use (think \"Party\" or \"Camping\").\n- Save a week's planned meals as a template to reuse.\n- Combined search/add box makes it easy to add new items.\n- Print out a week's plan to any AirPrint printer.\n- Configure your own meals: Add snacks, or remove breakfast if you don't want to plan it.\n- Email a plain text summary of the week's plan.\n- Add a note to any meal item, including clickable links.\n- Dropbox sync for families with multiple devices and accounts.\n- Use Siri for groceries: \"Add Milk to my Grocery List\".\n\n\"Before MealPlan, I’d buy food at the grocery store and then forget I had it .. a few days later it would go to waste. A few minutes every week standing in front of the fridge with MealPlan in hand will help you get the most out of what you have on hand. Plan it, print it out and stick it to your fridge!\"\n\nVisit the website for more information, and a detailed walkthrough of what MealPlan can do."

Fromage provides a convenient pocket resource of fantastic cheeses made throughout the world for your culinary exploration.  The cheese library contains well beyond 1,600 world cheeses from over 35 countries and is continuously expanded thanks to suggestions from our established base of Fromage users worldwide.\n\nEach cheese entry features artistically presented cheese photos, historically narrated flavor descriptions, website links to the producer’s dairy or fromager, and suggested best choices for complementary wines.  You can add your own favorite cheeses to the standard library and include personal notes about any of the cheeses.\n\nSearching within the library for that special cheese can be by name, country, milk-type, texture, or by your own custom tags (such as #atmystore).\n\nSo, if you’re a classically trained chef, professional party planner, cheese buyer, or just plain cheese lover, grab Fromage, your favorite wine, and experience the wonderful and historic flavors of cheese.\n_________________________________\n\nFromage comes with the ability to create personal cheese notes, rate cheeses from 1 to 5 stars (included an “Avoid” rating), add cheeses to your favorite lists (Try, Buy, or Favorites categories), record tasting impressions with up to 70 tasting keywords, and search the cheese library.\n\nYou can also enter your own cheeses (including photos captured from your device camera) and list those cheeses automatically in the “My Additions” category.  There is also a “Share” feature so cheese information can be sent (via e-mail) to friends or to the developer for inclusion in future versions of Fromage. \n_________________________________\n\nInternet or Wi-Fi connection is not required for program use, which is great for remote locations when no data plan is available.\n\nWhen internet is available, Fromage uses iCloud to synchronize your cheese entries and notes between all of your Apple devices which can include iPhone, iPad, and Macintosh.\n\nThe application provides English, French, Spanish, and German languages when the iOS device settings are set to that language."

The best-selling cookbook, Ratio: The Simple Codes Behind the Craft of Everyday Cooking, by me, Michael Ruhlman, is now an iPhone app that will help you calculate amounts of ingredients in all the fundamental culinary preparations.  When you know a ratio, you don’t know a recipe, you know 1,000.  And this application does all the calculating for you.\n\n “Cooking, like so many other creative endeavors is defined by relationships.  For instance, knowing exactly how much flour to put into a loaf of bread isn’t nearly as useful as understanding the relationship between the flour and the water, or fat, or salt.  That relationship is defined by a ‘ratio’ and having a ratio in hand is like having a secret decoder ring that frees you from the tyranny of recipes. ….Michael Ruhlman, in handing us mortals a power better suited to the gods, has changed the balance of kitchen power forever.” —Good Eats host Alton Brown\n\n\nWhat You Get:\n\n--THE 32 CRITICAL RATIOS that form the backbone of the culinary arts, with instructions: doughs, batters, meat preparations, custards, sauces (pasta dough and pizza dough, sponge cake and pancakes, fritters and crepes, stocks and sauces, crème caramel and chocolate sauce.\n\n--A CALCULATOR that figures out how much of each ingredient you need, no matter how many or how few people you want to serve.\n\n--An OUNCES-TO-GRAMS CONVERTER (ratios work no matter what unit you choose to use!).\n\n--DELICIOUS VARIATIONS FOR RECIPES on all the ratios, ideas for the creation of new dishes according to your tastes.\n\n--An easy way to STORE YOUR OWN RECIPES and notes that you’ve created from the basic ratios.\n\n--Quick fun ways to SHARE what your cooking with your fellow cooks, on Facebook and on Twitter.\n\n--Ratios is also a great way to understand and TWEAK YOUR OWN RECIPES, to help you make your pancakes even fluffier, your pizza dough crisper, your crème brulee richer."

The additional points are used as required.\n\nWeight:\n\nAll entered weights are stored in a list and displayed for a curve in the last few weeks. It is possible to set a weighing day at which you would like to have a memory for weighing.\n\nPoints Calculator:\n\nThe point calculator calculates the current smart points from calories, saturated fat, sugar and protein.\n\nDays:\n\nCalculates the permitted daily points based on the entered user data and changes the calculation depending on the current weight.\n\nExperience report:\n\nAfter I had registered with Weight Watchers at the beginning of 2016 with the aim of losing weight, I also used the Weight Watchers app to keep my diary and to document my weight in the weight table. With the app I had some difficulties and after an update were many functions to which I had become accustomed at once different. After some time I had the food I eat, which set with the ActivePoints and with not more pleased that I still have weekends.\nFurthermore, I have asked myself whether it is worth each month the Weight Watchers contribution to pay to use the app.\n\nThe result is the SmartWatchers diary. It can do everything I need as a support to take my plan even further. This app has only to be paid once and not every month again and none gets my data that I have stored.\n\nBecause I think others are thinking like this and have similar requirements as me, this app is now available in the App Store."

Then you probably own a circulator or a similar device. To start, a zip-bag, a cooking pot and a thermometer is all you need. Many Sous Vide recipes work without special equipment. But you will need good advice!\n\nSous Vide has been adopted in professional kitchens for producing precise and consistent results. The Sous Vide method produces perfectly cooked food with outstanding flavor. Its success in high-end cuisine changed the culinary world. With a few starting tips anyone can use this technique. Step-by-step tutorials and Sous Vide timers (mini-recipes with an alarm) help you along the way.\n\nIdeas, suggestions or anything you would like to change? Contact us with your feedback on UserVoice!\n\nThe time for a piece of meat to reach a core temperature can be calculated. A formula using thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and surface heat transfer calculates the time such shapes as cylinders, cubes and steaks need to acquire a certain core temperature. Consider the PolyScience Toolbox App or Douglas Baldwin’s formulas for calculating pasteurization times.\n\nBut food is never an exact geometrical shape and waiting for an extra hour for a piece to reach an additional half a degree is impractical. Adjustments for speed and efficiency improve the Sous Vide experience. We have tested Sous Vide recommendations that work and tutorials that make the first steps easy - for professionals and home cooks alike!\n\nSous Vide - no other cooking method gives you so much control!\n\nDon’t get the Anova Pro or the new Anova Precision Cooker (2019) as these devices are no longer equipped with Bluetooth!"

Learn about teas from all over the world with Tea's Encyclopedia, including preparation tips, signs of quality, tasting notes, harvest seasons and more. Brew the perfect cup every time with Tea's smart tea timer and note taker. Whether you're looking up what \"Sencha\" is when you're at a cafe or refining your oolong's steep time to perfection, Tea's got you covered.\n\n**Features**\n\n• Tea Encyclopedia: Learn about teas from all over the world with Tea's all-new Encyclopedia: where they're grown, how they're made, preparation tips, signs of quality, and more! Tea can now recognize over 500 tea names.\n\n• Tea to Try: Tea's Encyclopedia integrates with Reminders to allow you to create a list of teas to try.\n\n• Smart Tea Timer: Tea's terrific timer remembers your favorite brew times for each of your teas. \n\n• Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram Integration: With the tap of a button, you can have Tea share your tasting notes and photos with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\n• Teapot Picker: Tea's teapot picker lets you choose which teapot you'll use to brew your tea, and can even automatically tell you how much tea you'll need for that teapot.\n\n• Notes and Rating System: After your timer is up, Tea lets you save tasting notes, take a photo and rate your brew. Tea even keeps track of your brewing time, tea amount, and temperature, so that you can hone in on the perfect brew for each of your teas. \n\n• Default Brew Suggestions: Not all teas are meant for use with boiling water. Tea comes pre-loaded with brew suggestions (temperature, time, leaf amount) for over 200 tea names and 12 tea types, all prepared by tea expert Thomas Smith. \n\n• Automatic Unit Conversion: Tea's Set Brew screen automatically converts units for you. If your tea's temperature instructions come in degrees Celsius, for example, Tea automatically converts it to Fahrenheit if that is your preferred unit.\n\n• Inventory Tracker: When you input a new tea, Tea automatically calculates how many brews you can make with that tea. Each time you use Tea's timer, Tea recalculates how many brews you have remaining. Be in full command of your tea inventory.\n\n• Multiple Infusion Support: Tea intelligently counts your tea infusions and preloads your notes with infusion number.\n\n• Shake to Shuffle: Can't decide on which tea to have? Simply give your iOS device a shake, and Tea will select one at random for you!"

This app is part of the popular TracknShare family of apps.\n\nReview from App Store Australia, 5 Stars\nAwesome app - by Nada gaza\n\"This App is amazing to manage cravings or any binge eat disorder.. It helps me be aware of what and why I eat and which will help me alot in achieving my goals.. I really recommend it to everyone\"\n\nBased on the popular Track & Share platform, this app helps you cultivate mindfulness. Developed by a mindful eater who uses it every day to bring more awareness and joy to eating. This is not a diet plan and not a calorie counter, but it might work better for your health and happiness. Try it out, it might be just right for you. \n\nWhat is mindfulness?\nMindful Eating Tracker works with two modes of mind: awareness and doing-thinking. It is desirable that one can easily move between these modes of mind.\n\nStuck in doing-thinking mode?\nThis app helps by building awareness of different types of hunger. It also supports doing-thinking, e.g., you can track time set aside for eating, time exercised, and if you need to, track weight.\n\nBasic concepts employed by the Mindful Eating Tracker app\n\nArising food cravings are real\nAcknowledge an arising food thought by making a note. Decide to let it fade away or to act on it.\n\nThere are many types of hunger\nCultivate awareness of eye, nose, mouth, mind, heart, social, stomach hunger, thirst, listen to the needs of your body.\nHint: friends, not potato chips feed social hunger.\n\nEnjoy, satisfy, express yourself\nConsume the right food for each hunger. Become aware of how much you enjoy each food. Capture your level of satisfaction. Express gratitude.\n\nWill I lose weight with this app?\nYou may, or not. The intention is to cultivate awareness and right action. If you need to track weight, look in the app's number category.\n\nDoes it work?\nGraph your journey. You might find that taking care of your different hungers, making time for eating comes with more joy, satisfaction, gratefulness, and healthier weight. Did it work?\n\nThe visual calendar\nLets you explore trends and patterns one item at a time. To compare items use the multi-graph."

It offers one hundred and twenty two maps, defining the wine regions. It is NOT an encyclopaedia of wine, and does not give any textual definitions or comment. Wine Maps is a purely visual reference, which allows you to search for the location of a wine region. With the exception of the top wineries in Bordeaux, individual vineyards do not appear on the maps. There's just too many of them!\n\nEach map is one or two taps away from the main screen. Simply choose from the main wine region list, and you instantly have a map of that region. You can search for regions by name, and Wine Maps will neatly zoom into its location. The surrounding regions will be greyed out to highlight the selected region. Each map has the wine regions clearly presented, along with rivers, cities, and major towns. \n\nYou can adjust the major components for map. for example to hide the labels for wine regions. You can hide the rivers, or the towns and cities. On each map, controls are provided to show, grey out, or hide individual wine regions. \n\nFor commercial users, who would like to make more extensive use of the maps, an in-app purchase has been added. This provides a licence to distribute maps, via websites, videos, presentations, and more.\n\nWine Maps is also bundled with a companion app for your Apple TV. Allowing you to show off your wine knowledge, and TV simultaneously!\n\n\nFeature Summary:\n• Locate one of 1500+ wine regions in seconds\n• 130 Maps covering 25 countries\n• Accessible top down approach\n• Maps can be printed, or exported as images \n• Test yourself, to help with learning the world's wine regions\n• A licence for commercial distribution is available as in in-app purchase\n• Maps can be altered.

In BLW (Baby Led Weaning) you don't put spoons, or pieces of food in your baby’s mouth. You simply offer your baby food, and he eats what he wants.\n\nBaby-led weaning allows babies to control their solid food consumption by \"self-feeding\" from the very beginning of their experiences with food. Baby-led weaning places the emphasis on exploring taste, texture, color and smells as the baby sets their own pace for the meal, and chooses which foods to concentrate on. Instead of spooning food into your baby's mouth, you present him or her with varied finger foods from which to choose and he or she chooses what to eat and how much. If she doesn't touch the oatmeal balls you made for her you do not put them in her mouth, you just offer them to her again at another meal."

Defaults are provided for all preferences, and may be customized separately for all modes as required.\n\n• A wide array of Presets are provided in all modes of operation that are typical of those found in home and commercial service. Each mode provides a full set of custom Presets that are user defined.\n\n• Full recipe details database maintained separately for Coffee, Espresso and Cupping. Sorting by Date, Name and Taste Score provided. \n\n• The VST Universal Brewing Control Chart supports direct touch-screen data input, pan and zoom functions, auto-scrolling of chart with ordinate and abscissa axis and reset functions. \n\nDesign points for % TDS and % EXT are step-less with snap-to-grid increments provided (TDS @ 0.05% and EXT at 0.1% increments). \n\nRegion of Interest (ROI) overlays are optionally provided for SCAA, SCAE, NCA regions with taste defect labels. Custom User defined ROI is also included separately for all modes.  \n\n• Complete calculation results are displayed for: Dose, Brew Water, Beverage, Liquid Retained Ratio, Spent Grounds Weight, Coffee or Espresso Brew Ratio, Extraction Yield in both Design and Measured values."

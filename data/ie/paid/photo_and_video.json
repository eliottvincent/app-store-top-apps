The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time.

If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

From 4 minutes to 1/8000 sec., aperture from 1.0 to 512 and iso from 3 to 6400.\n\n• Automatic priority for aperture or speed. (Automatic Av and Tv modes).\n\n• Automatic ISO or locked ISO options.\n\n• Point metering in camera view.\n\n• Maximum aperture limited by the selected lens.\n\n• Calculate the average of any number of measurements you want.\n\n• Read the exposure data of any photo from the gallery.\n\n• Calculate hyperfocal distance for 5 memorized lenses. Which also blocks maximum aperture.\n\n• Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.\n\n• Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light. (IR button)\n\n• Exposure value EV on an analog scale or right up front.\n\n• Two LED indicators show whether the measurement is unreliable due to lack of light in the scene, or if we have under 30% battery left.\n\n• On 3.5 \" displays preset lens buttons tilting the device or tapping at the bottom.\n\n• Be advised that accurate incident light reading needs a diffuser attached to the front camera. Without the diffuser still can be used but think about it, it will be a reflected reading taken with the front camera.\n\nI'm an independent photographer/designer/developer and am very grateful for your support. Trying to do the best lightmeter app ever, a lot more to come. You can ask for any improvement and I'll be happy to help. This app is constantly reviewed and improved because it is my tool, if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me by email at davidquiles@me.com\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid Quiles"

It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Fire TV.\n\n* Supported Fire TVs: Fire TV Box+Stick, Fire TV Cube and all other devices of the Fire TV Family.\n\n* Supported TVs: Insignia TV and Toshiba TV with Fire TV Edition\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Fire TV must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

      "label": "DoubleTake by Filmic transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll."

The Yin Yang symbol is an example of this design philosophy. The use of Nōtan in art composition is a powerful tool to help the artist identify the structure of the light and dark portions of the image they want to incorporate into their project. \n\nThe first function simply divides the image into black and white with colors above the set value being white and those below being black. You can then use the slider to move that line to enhance detail that may otherwise be obscured.\n\nThe second and third functions displays the image in either a grayscale or color so the artist can focus on the structure and design of the image.\n\nThe last 3 functions are Levels. They set either 3, 4, or up to 10 levels of color spread over black, gray and white pallets. The 3 and 4 levels have sliders to adjust where those levels are while the Levels function just evenly divides the image by the number of levels.\n\nAnd of course, share your image in many ways.\n\nAny artist will benefit from seeing their work in a different light. NotanIzer is that light."

He is commonly known as \"the painter of light\" and his work is regarded as a Romantic preface to Impressionism. Turner's talent was recognised early in his life. Financial independence allowed Turner to innovate freely; his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint. Turner placed human beings in many of his paintings to indicate his affection for humanity on the one hand, but its vulnerability and vulgarity amid the 'sublime' nature of the world on the other.\n\n\nJMW TURNER ARTWORK: VIRTUAL ART GALLERY FEATURES:\n◉ HD image quality allows you to zoom in and observe the smallest details\n◉ Valuable information about the artist and most important paintings\n◉ Famous paintings available on full screen\n◉ Background music and slideshow\n◉ Share paintings on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter etc.\n\nLEARN ABOUT JMW TURNER\n\nJoseph Mallord William Turner was an English Romanticist landscape painter. Turner was considered a controversial figure in his day, but is now regarded as the artist who elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting. As Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant. His father's death in 1829 had a profound effect on him, and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression. Check out his virtual gallery to see more details about his life.\n\nJMW Turner Artwork: Virtual Art Gallery is your pocket virtual museum with Turner complete works available in English, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese.\n\nPOWERFUL EDUCATIONAL TOOL FOR MASTERING JMW TURNER ARTWORK:\n\n1.

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all Samsung Smart TVs and Blu-ray Players.

Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Samsung or any other trademark mentioned here."

The app is targeted at stills photographers or film makers working in either film or digital. If you don’t have your big camera with you, Viewfinder Preview is still great for photo sketching, location scouting or story boarding.\n\nThe app includes\n\n- Customisable menus so you can include the film/sensor formats and focal lengths you care about.\n- A fully configurable light meter.\n- You can take photos with it, so you have a record of shots you were framing.\n- Photos taken with the app include additional data that describe the film format, focal length and lighting meter settings at the time the shot was taken\n- Add notes to your photos\n- A photo gallery for viewing photos taken with the app which also displays the additional data\n- Share images in emails, messages\n- Create albums of photos from the same project, trip etc\n- Create PDF documents of albums\n- Film stock emulation\n- Wide angle lens adapter support"

Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots.

      "label": "Watch any web-video, online movie, livestream or live tv show on your Sony TV, Hisense TV or VEWD powered Smart TVs. Enjoy the show on your big screen with the no#1 web video streamer.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast for Sony TV you can browse the web and stream any web video, online movie, livestream or live tv show you want on your Sony TV. Mp4, m3u8, hls livestreams and also video-over-https are supported.\n \nThere is no time limit at all! You can watch videos of 2 minutes or 2 hours or even more. Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for link detection and send the video with a single tap to your Sony TV. The discovered link will be shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the App Store on your Sony TV, search for 'TV Cast' and install the companion app.\n\n* If your Sony TV is powered by Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, please download our dedicated App 'Video & TV Cast | Google Cast' to enable casting.\n\n* Please enter the ip-address of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your Sony Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* Please use the Remote Playbar for video control while browsing (see more info below)\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop.\n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Sony or any other trademark mentioned here."

Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  \n\nOK!  Now what??\n\nDo you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do!

ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!\n\nWorth a shot !

      "label": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!"

      "label": "enhanceAI will vastly improve less-than-ideal images and add incredible detail with our optional Super Resolution.\n\nAutomatically remove blur and noise, improve images and add up to 8x detail with enhanceAI. Don't worry about the details. Just give enhanceAI a less-than-perfect shot, and enhanceAI will do the rest.\n\nGenerally, the less perfect or lower resolution an image is, the more dramatic the improvement will be, but enhanceAI can add a clean touch to images that aren't damaged.\n\nOur optional Super Resolution can add a jaw-dropping 8x detail to portions of images or enlarge entire images up to gigapixels (that's billions of pixels). \n\nWhether you're looking to print your photos in high resolution or want to make them look their best, enhanceAI is the app for you.\n\nAbout Image Reconstruction\nOur Reconstruction mode destroys part of the image and rebuilds it using our neural network trained from millions of examples of high-quality photos.\n\nPractically all less-than-ideal images are likely to gain a noticeable improvement - automatically! For instance: blurry, soft, low-resolution, and noisy images are often significantly improved. enhanceAI will breathe new life into old photos.\n\nDepending on the strength and image, it is also possible to get a hyper-realism effect for images that don't require reconstruction.\n\nThe higher the Reconstruction setting, the more the original image is destroyed and rebuilt. The lower the strength, the more detail preserved. Unless an image is severely damaged, higher quality output often results from using the lower settings at the expense of taking longer.\n\nSeverely damaged images can benefit from multiple passes of Reconstruction. When using Reconstruction, there is a re-enhance option in the more options menu.\n\nAbout Super Resolution\nUnlike traditional image enlargement that produces undesirable pixelization and artifacts, Super Resolution uses neural networks trained from millions of examples on the difference between low and high-resolution images. Then, when our neural network sees low-resolution images, it can make highly accurate predictions of high-resolution versions. In other words, it's trained to \"imagine\" detail that is non-existent in the original image and works exceedingly well compared to traditional image enlargement.\n\nWe offer Super Resolution as an in-app purchase with A.I. trained at 4x and 8x (available as 2x through 8x). We're confident you'll be amazed by it, so we are happy to offer a free 3-day trial.\n\nNote that 6x-8x requires an iPhone with an A15 or better processor or an iPad with M1 chips or better. At the time of writing, that means 8x runs on iPhone 13s, 14s, and the current family of iPad Pros.\n\nProcessing Time\nenhanceAI is capable of creating huge images with more than a billion pixels. Creating and writing huge images is time-consuming on practically any device or computer.\n\nReconstruction can take a minute to several minutes, depending on your device, image resolution, and setting. Given the same image on the same device, Super Resolution will take longer.\n\nFor Reconstruction and particularly Super Resolution, we strongly advise cropping the image on our optional crop screen to only the section of an image needed. Unless starting with a low-resolution image, we only recommend running Super Resolution on the entire picture when using it for a print or other specific purpose. Generally, there isn't a need for 1/4 billion or more pixel images, but enhanceAI will create them if you command it and give it enough time.\n\nPlease share your #enhanceAI creations.\nReach us @3DTOPO\n\n\nTerms of Use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Watch any web video and your personal photos, videos & music on your Chromecast or Google Cast powered TV. Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!! And you designed it work easily and quickly\"\nRyan, England\n\n“I looooove your app. It has taken my Chromecast to a whole new level.”\nRosalind Romero, USA\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC."

Use your finger as a brush to \"paint\" sections of your image black and white, or to bring back the original color.  Zooming in and out using the two-finger pinching gesture allows you to work on details with pixel-accuracy.\n\nFeatures:\n- Short tutorial videos explain the use of all features and will have you editing your images in minutes.\n- Choose photos to edit from your iPhone photo library or from Dropbox or Flickr.\n- Share your edited images on Twitter or Flickr. Email them, or save them to your Dropbox.\n- Save multiple sessions to resume your work later.\n- Undo any number of accidental brush strokes.\n- An alternative view mode highlights the regions that will remain in color with a red tint. This makes it easier to see and adjust the boundaries between color and black & white regions.\n- Choose from 4 different brushes (hard or soft edged, opaque or transparent) and adjust the brush size.\n- Hide the toolbars in full screen mode."

Combine it with our anti-shake for even clearer zoomed shots.\n \n+ Timer & Sound Capture\nA timer lets you set up timed group photos. You can set the interval between 2 and 300 seconds. Just tap the numbers when the timer pulls up to change the timing interval. You can even set it to repeat mode to capture photos automatically. The sound capture setting allows you to take photos by detecting noise to snap your photo. \n \n+ Full Screen Camera Button\nThe big photo button makes it easy to capture those photos without having to try and tap the tiny photo button, potentially missing that candid shot. Just tap the screen to take the photo.\n \n+ Prevent Blurry Photos with Anti-shake\nAnti-shake stabilization helps eliminate those blurry photos caused by excessive iPhone camera movement.\n \n+ Improve Photo Composition with Guides\nCamera guides help you compose and align photos based on known photographic principles.

Great for getting that action shot!\n \n+ Camera Manual\nLots of hints on the best way to take photos on your iPhone. Read the quick tips to greatly improve your photos.\n \n+ Review your photos\nA new user interface makes reviewing your photos a breeze.

Also included is a full-screen slide show and the ability to pan and zoom around your photos. All photos are saved to the camera roll for quick syncing with your computer. \n \n+ Edit your photos.\nWhat photo app would be complete without the ability to edit your photos? We have over 20 great One Step filters! From Grunge, 70's style, Lomo and Cross Processing to Flash, Cinema, and Pseudo HDR we have got you covered!  If that's not enough we have 20 Adjustment Filters to give you fine control over hue, contrast, brightness, etc. Crop your photo to improve its composition.  We also have custom borders you can apply to any filter.  All filters can be stacked to give you nearly infinite options with the look of a photo.  Turn a drab photo into a work of art with a couple of clicks. \n \n+ Share your photos.\nNeed to get that photo or video onto Facebook, Twitter, Flickr?  We’ve got you covered!  Now post your photos and videos directly to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Picasa, MobileMe, Tumblr, YouTube, Clipboard and Email. You can even post to multiple services at once!\n\nIf photos are not showing in Album View.\nGo to your Settings icon on the iPhone.  Select General > Location Services.

The program was dead on…\" - National Geographic\n\n\"One of the most powerful photography applications that I've seen, one that you'll be using for years and years.\"  - AdoramaTV\n\nThe Photographer's Ephemeris (TPE) helps plan outdoor photography shoots in natural light, particularly landscape and urban scenes. It's a map-centric Sun, Moon and Milky Way calculator: see how the light will fall on the land, day or night, for any location on earth.\n\nWhether you need at-a-glance information on today's sun, moon and Milky Way data for your current location, or need to plan a precise alignment of the full moon for a future shoot, TPE has the tools you need. The combination of augmented reality, line-of-sight analysis and visual search supports the most sophisticated photo planning needs.\n\nNight mode features a 3D representation of the Milky Way, pole stars and major constellations directly over the map, so you can easily visualize exactly how to align your shot.\n\nResearch and save your own list of favorite photographic locations, using 7 different map types (including 2 offline maps) and save them in your locations list. Favorite locations are always displayed right on the map.\n\nAdvanced features including visual sun and moon search, automatic time zone and elevation detection, correction for atmospheric refraction and height above the horizon, ensuring that you have the best possible information for planning your shoot.\n\nYou can even determine when the sun or moon will rise from behind nearby hills and mountains.\n\nKey features:\n\n- Time/direction of sun, moon, and galactic center rise/set\n- View azimuth and altitude of sun/moon and the galactic center for any time of day/night\n- Milky Way, stars and asterisms visualization via 3D map overlay\n- Moon phase and % illumination\n- Civil, nautical and astronomical twilight\n- 2 topographic maps\n- 2 offline map types\n- Movable map pins: drag and drop the pin exactly where you need it\n- Map autorotation using the compass (on compatible devices)\n- Shadow lengths displayed to scale on map\n- Save any location you want: no fixed lists\n- Celestial events including moon phases, apogee, perigee, solstice, equinox\n- Network connection not required for rise/set time, azimuths and sun/moon position\n\nAdvanced features:\n\n- Augmented reality view for on location scouting\n- Saved location synchronization between devices and the free TPE web app\n- Automatic time zone detection\n- Elevation above sea level\n- Distance, bearing and elevation angle between any two points\n- Location import/export from KML\n- Magnetic north option\n- Configurable timeline display\n- Sun/moon transit times\n- 'Golden hour' time/duration\n- Light pollution overlay\n\nGeek features:\n\n- Line of sight analysis\n- Find when the sun/moon will appear from behind a hill or ridge\n- Advanced visual sun and moon search\n- Azimuth or altitude search priority\n- New crescent moon visibility\n- Distance to the visible horizon\n\nAvailable map types include:\n\n- Standard, Satellite/Hybrid, Terrain\n- OpenCycleMap Topographic\n- OpenStreetMap\n\nSunrise/sunset color forecasts are available (covering lower 48, southern Canada and Europe) with a subscription to the Skyfire service, available via in-app purchase.\n\nNote:\n\n- Maps and elevation-based calculations require a data connection, except for offline map tiles previously downloaded and stored on your device\n- Topographic map data is available only between 60°N and 47°S\n- Availability of map types is subject to change, due to 3rd party map service availability, terms or conditions\n- The app itself supports only English language at present\n- Augmented reality requires an iPhone 6s (or later), iPad Pro or 2017 model and iOS 11 or later"

      "label": "Updated for latest iOS!\n\nToonPAINT allows you to easily create awesome looking cartoon-paintings with your own photos.\n\nEven if you have never drawn or painted before, ToonPAINT sets you up for quick success by providing a \"MagiSketch\" that you can simply color-in. It's as easy as \"paint-by-numbers\", but using your own personal images. Unlike other photography apps, ToonPAINT is not just an image filter -- it's a smart-painting application that enables you to express your creativity and obtain compelling results without requiring you to take Art classes.\n\nSimply import a photo, create an \"automagic\" sketch of the photo, color-in at your leisure, and you're done!\n\nIMPORTANT -- You can CHANGE THE COLORS in the palette by DOUBLE-TAPPING on the color splats. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n---------\n\n* IMPORT: Import pictures from your iPhone or iPod touch, or even take a snapshot with the iPhone's built-in camera.\n\n* MAGISKETCH: State-of-the-Art image processing algorithms process your input image to create a customizable sketch, fully automatically. You can create many exciting effects just by adjusting the basic and advanced MagiSketch settings.\n\n* PAINTING: You can color-in the MagiSketch by painting with your finger to create amazing images within minutes.\n\n* TOON COLOR: With our new optional ToonColor feature, you can take the hard part out of creating great looking color sketches and let the app do the heavy lifting.\n\n* SESSIONS: Your current session is automatically saved when you load a new image, so you can continue it at a later time.\n\n* UNDO/REDO: You can correct any painting mishaps by shaking the iPhone, or by accessing undo/redo via the \"bomb\" icon.\n\n* NAVIGATION: While you paint, you can pinch-zoom and pan to give you the most control over your painting.\n\n* HELP/HINTS: New to painting? We've got your back! When you first use ToonPAINT, help screens instruct you about the functionality of the app. For more advanced users, we provide in-app hints and tips.\n\n* LANGUAGES: ToonPAINT now supports 10 different languages\n\n\nWe hope you enjoy using ToonPAINT as much as we enjoyed creating it for you!\n\nYour Insatiable Genius team.\n\n\n(Demo images under creative commons license, by Flickr users BodogGirl, Mickael Casol, and Izzard)"

      "label": "Works great on iOS 11 and iPhone X! Thanks to users for the 1441 ***** 5 star reviews on iTunes! The essential Watermarking App for Professionals, Business and Personal Use. Easily, secure and protect your photos with a text, graphic, signature or QR watermark. Adding a visible watermark to a photo displays it is created and owned by you. Watermarking is increasingly important and is like signing your name to an image. A watermark subtly displays, no matter where your photo goes, that it's yours. Watermarking can also be used to add your email, url, a personal message or fun graphics to any photo or Pokemon Go screenshot.\n\n\"It's by far the best watermarking App I've seen to date on iOS.\"\n- Terry White, review on bestappsite.com\n\nVideo Review by the Daily App Show:\nhttp://dailyappshow.com/iwatermark\n\nThanks to all iWatermark users for the great reviews, feedback and suggestions. \n\niWatermark, is the only watermarking tool available for all 4 platforms iPhone/iPad, Mac and Windows. iWatermark is the most popular professional watermarking tool for photos.\n\nSocial media sharing at full resolution to Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Twitter, Camera Album, Clipboard or Email (3 resolution options).\n\nFeatures\n\n  * Touch gestures.\n     ** Click to move the watermark location.\n     ** Pinch/zoom to expand/contract the size of the watermark. \n     ** Two fingers at once to rotate the watermark to any angle.\n  * Batch processing (all at once) or sequential.\n  * Easily adjust the watermarks scale, opacity, font, color, size, position and angle.\n  * Create your own subtle text or graphic watermarks or select from the included example watermarks (both text and graphics).\n  * Included examples are both text (names, dates, tag data, etc.) and graphic (signatures, logos, etc.) watermarks which can be used immediately. \n  * 162 fonts for your text watermarks 112 + 50 iOS fonts.\n  * Displays each font.\n  * 34 high-res watermarks.\n  * Import your own graphic watermarks by sending yourself an email with attached graphic.\n  * One button import of your signature for use as a watermark.\n  * Complete and easy to understand manual.\n  * Create a QR watermark which is like a barcode. QR codes can contain up to 4000 chars of information. QR codes can then be read with a scanner or smartphone with the right app revealing the info you encoded. \n\nWhy Watermark?\n\nDigitally sign your photos/artwork with iWatermark to claim, secure and maintain your intellectual property and reputation.\n\n- Photos go viral then they fly off globally. Watermark with name, email or url so your photo has a visible and legal connection to you.\n- Build your company brand, by having your company logo on all your images.\n- Promote your company, name and website by using QR codes as watermarks.\n- Avoid the surprise of seeing your photos and/or artwork elsewhere on the web or in an ad.\n- Avoid the conflicts, costly litigation and headaches from plagiarists who claim they didn't know that you created it.\n- Avoid intellectual property (IP) squabbles.\n\nQ:I want to stamp my signature as my watermark. How do I add my graphic signature like the examples, Picasso, Ben Franklin, etc.? \nA:Use our signature tool or make the .png graphics on your computer, email it to yourself, open the email on your iOS device and save to your photo album. In iWatermark create a graphic watermark and choose the graphic from your photo album to add it as a new watermark.\n\nQ:Will it work with Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus?\nA:Yes\n\nSee the manual for more details:\nhttp://www.plumamazing.com/iphone/iwatermark-iphone/iwatermarkhelp/\n\nIMPORTANT: The signatures of John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Galileo are just examples of graphic watermarks. They are the real signatures of these historic people. They are there as examples to show what is possible. We recommend you create your own signature, logo or QR code watermarks.\n\nContact us if you need help or have a suggestion."

      "label": "The original and the best, accept no cheap imitations ! \nRecord a bird singing and use Automatic Recognition to help identify it. Unlike all other apps, no internet or mobile connection is needed.\n\n•   The Times Newspaper said the app \"Does what it says on the \n\ntin\" and were amazed that \"this astonishing piece of software \ncosts about the same as a cup of coffee\".\n\n•   \"In direct comparison Bird Song Id showed better results than Chirpomatic\". - naturschutz.ch - Swiss Birding Magazine \n\nCopied by a few, bettered by none, Bird Song Id is three years  \nahead of anyone else in this field !\n\n•   The Telegraph Newspaper said \"Bird Song Id is a good walk improved, and may even put a spring in your step\".\n\n•   over 1000 good ratings\n\nAutomatic Recognition takes place on the device, no connection to the internet or mobile network is needed.\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs good quality recordings to work. See the HELP below, or follow the Developer Website link to find out how to improve your recordings.\n\nAutomatic Recognition will help identify a good cross section of bird song in the British Isles, but you will need a good quality recording. Lots of blue and green peaks reaching to the top of the analysis graph is a good indication of a quality recording. Help and examples are included in the app to guide you.\n\nHow successful is it ? Our aim is to get the correct bird in the top three of those listed. In our testing of over 1,000 samples we found the success rate to be 85%.\n\nFollow the Developer Website link to see a demo of Automatic Recognition on YouTube\n\n--------------- HELP ----------------\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs a good quality recording of the bird.\n-------------\nOnly record when a single bird is singing, or when a single bird is dominant\n-------------\nThe analysis graph should have plenty of blue and green colors with few or no black peaks.\n-------------\nThe peaks on the graph should reach all the way to the top. Low peaks indicate poor quality and recognition is unlikely.\n-------------\nThe Audio Quality, shown at the top of the results screen, should be at least Good, and preferably Very Good or Excellent\n-------------\nThe highest score should be above 70% to be useful. Below this and the system is telling you it is not sure what the song is.\n-------------\nA difference between two birds of less than 10% is not that significant, so listen to the samples from both to help you further\n-------------\nSee the samples for how the analysis graph should look (to see the samples press the sample button at the top right of the help page)\n-------------\nMake sure it is very quiet apart from the bird song which should be nice and loud\n-------------\nBe as close to the bird as you can be without disturbing it\n-------------\nBe patient, dont expect miracles, the system works but needs good clear recordings\n-------------\nThe microphone is at the bottom of an iPhone, point the bottom of the phone towards the bird\n-------------\nRemove the case from your iPhone if you use one as this can dampen the microphone\n-------------\nRecord a single bird at a time\n-------------\nCapture at least two singing episodes if you can. \n-------------\nRecord for the full 30 seconds\n-------------\nAvoid windy conditions. Air moving over the microphone will mask the bird sounds\n-------------\nMake sure there is plenty of life in the battery. Your device will reduce power going to the microphone as the battery runs down\n-------------\nPlaying songs to the app from recorded material on the internet, other apps or CDs is unlikely to work as this material is digitally processed and edited (inter phase gaps are often shortened). They sound very different to recording birds for real on an iPhone or iPad in the natural environment. Its a bit like putting rocket fuel in a lawn mower.\n-------------"

      "label": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’ and \"App of the Day\".\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use automatic recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with Spiny Software in any way."

Beware of other applications which use other translations and cost much more.\n\nAudio of the Mass Readings.  Audio is only available for more recent dates (sliding window of aprx. 30 days). * WIFI connection recommended for optimal playback of audio files.\n\nOrder of Mass: Ever wish you could follow along in Mass and have all the prayers, responses, etc. available.

A short description and helpful tips are given for each song or call, as well as a photo of each bird. Birds can be sorted by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to rarer species. Or sort by song style, so that you can compare birds that hoot and coo, or those with high pitched songs for example. You can also sort by name, habitat or bird group.\n\nAfter listening, try the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nThe slideshow section can be used as a way to relax, or switch the voiceover on and see if you can say the name of the bird before the voiceover. This is a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?! \n\nIncludes birds from Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Italy."

The way in which it works is simple – make a recording with your iPhone, and Warblr will identify the species of bird/s that can be found in that recording, providing you with images and descriptions to help you learn more about our feathered friends.\n\nIn using Warblr, you will be contributing to a citizen science project, and hopefully one day helping to protect endangered species. We will be making the recordings and the data collected on species identification freely available to be used for research and conservation.\n\nWarblr can recognise over 220 species of British bird, and works particularly well for garden and woodland species. Our technology uses the latest techniques in machine learning, and is supported by Queen Mary University of London.\n\n**Please note – if you’re having any issues using Warblr please just drop us a line to hello@warblr.net**\n\nFind us on:\ntwitter.com/WarblrUK\nfacebook.com/Warblr"

Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea!\n\nSo whether you're aspiring to be the next Shakespeare, looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!"

This means that the Wolfram Tides Calculator can only give historical, present, and future tide information for locations for which there are tide stations. Presently Wolfram|Alpha has information from more than 2,000 tide stations around the world. If you believe that there is a tide station near you, but we are not reporting data from it, please post the location of the tide station, including a URL if possible. For more information on tide predictions see, for example: http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/predhist.html.\n\nThe Wolfram Tides Calculator is powered by the Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine and is created by Wolfram Research, makers of Mathematica—the world's leading software system for mathematical research and education.\n\nThe Wolfram Tides Calculator draws on the computational power of Wolfram|Alpha's supercomputers over a 3G, 4G, or Wi-Fi connection."

Identification can be enjoyed by the whole family.\n\nMushroom Id has been created by professional published ecologists, and uses images selected with the specific aim of aiding identification. Anatomical, ecological and taxonomic information is also included.\n\nMushroom Id can be used to keep a log of your fungi sightings making it easy to build a record of all the species you've seen. \n\nSUNBIRD apps appear in Countryfile's top 10, and have been described as \"incredibly useful\" by ITV's Seth Conway and \"lovely\" by Adam Vaughan of the Guardian.\n\nSUNBIRD field guides are the only products on the market that use the KUSAM species identification methodology. This state of the art method is a modern taxonomic keying system designed specifically for use on mobile devices.\n\nThe app does not need an internet connection, all content is downloaded when the app is purchased. We will be adding new species regularly. Don't forget to keep your app up to date.\n\nWe use the term 'Mushroom' to mean any type of fungi. Traditionally the term has been used only for Field Mushrooms by some, gilled fungi by others. There is no scientific limitation on the term and we have used it in this app for all types of fungi.\n\nThe app is intended for the general interest user with a love of the natural world. The app is not intended for use when foraging for wild foods and we strongly recommend you do not handle or eat wild mushrooms, many are extremely poisonous and easily misidentified. \n\nSunbird Images also develop apps for other companies see our website for details:\nhttp://sunbird.tv/de/sunbird-apps-ebooks/"

With this app for iPhone and iPad, you can now recolour the objects in your photos with any RAL colour – quickly and easily.\nIn only three steps, anything can be recoloured with RAL iCOLOURS:\n\n1.Take a photo with your iPhone.\n2.Select one of 2,328 RAL colours.\n3.Recolour the object in the photo.\n\nRAL iCOLOURS is as useful as it is inspiring. Painters, architects, graphic designers and Web designers can now make it easier for their customers to make colour decisions. With the RAL Colours app, you can quickly give them a picture of your colour concept. You can present colour designs to your customers on site and display alternatives directly. And you can save your colour selection by project name and send photos of recoloured objects via email.\n\nThe app’s colour palette includes the RAL CLASSIC and RAL EFFECT colour collections and all of the colours in the RAL DESIGN System – all 2,328 RAL colours. The corresponding L*a*b*, sRGB, CMYK and LRV values are listed for each colour. And RAL iCOLOURS is also compatible with COLORCATCH NANO, the Colorix colorimeter. This device incorporates a revolutionary new technology to accurately measure the color of smooth, structured or patterned surfaces to determine the corresponding color of the preselected swatch. NANO reads and measures 50'000 pixels separately. During reading it eliminates automatically all non-dominant colors such as shade effects and dirty surfaces.\n\nFor better understanding of the functions and use of the App, please watch the demo on the video first.\nLink to video: https://www.ral-farben.de/iphone-app-icolours.html?&L=1\n\nThe colour values enable the user to make a visual choice of RAL colours. Only the primary standards of RAL CLASSIC, RAL DESIGN and RAL EFFECT shall be used for the preparation and control of RAL colours.\n\nRAL is a registered trade mark of RAL gGmbH. The presentation of the RAL colours is based on a licence granted by RAL gGmbH. Please visit www.ral-colours.de for further information.\n\nDue to technical limitations, colors seen in this App may not accurately reflect paint colors.

Buoyage: A graphic reference guide with 70 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of buoy, their uses, appearance, permutations and light characteristics.\n\n2. Lights: A graphic reference guide with 12 illustrations and captions which explain the different types of light and their characteristics, used by beacons and lighthouses.\n\n3.

Perform an automatic calculation where the circuit is sized automatically or enter fixed sizes to run a calculation check on an existing design. Created for electrical engineers, electricians and designers. Suitable for Industrial, Commercial or Domestic Low Voltage Circuits.\n\nSimple, fast and reliable. 17th edition cable sizer performs cable Calculation for AC circuits in line with British Standard 7671:2008(2011) IEE Wiring regulations, without having to lookup the relevant tables.\n\nSimply enter the circuit parameters, hit calculate, and 17th edition cable sizer does the work for you by selecting the correct cable based on current carrying capacity, earth loop impedance and voltage drop. If you want to change a parameter, go back and modify it, then re-calculate to see the difference.\n\nAlternatively set the cable size and number of conductors in parallel and perform a calculation to check an existing design.\n\nResults are presented in a simple format with all rating factors given, which can then be sent by email.\nAll rating factors are considered, all installation methods available, power factor and conductor operating temperatures are incorporated into the calculation. Parallel cables are supported automatically if current exceeds maximum available for cable type.\n\nR1+R2, Zs and Fault currents are calculated and displayed. Automatic checks of Zs are performed for MCB's, RCBO's and BS3036 fuses.\n\nThe adiabatic calculation is also performed for applicable cable types with the ability to choose either armouring or separate CPC type. This provides circuit disconnection times based on the minimum fault current for BS88, BS1361 and BS3036 fuses.\n\nTypical external earth loop impedances can be used based on public supply type or transformer size.\n\nThe following cables are supported (in every available size):\n\nBS6724 Single Core and Multicore Armoured XLPE Copper/Aluminium\nBS5467 Single Core and Multicore Armoured PVC Copper/Aluminium\nFlat Twin and earth XLPE\nFlat Twin and earth PVC\n6491B Single core XLPE Copper/Aluminium\n6491X Single core PVC Copper/Aluminium\n\nThe following protective devices can be used:\n\nBS EN 60898 MCB Types B, C and D\nBS EN 60947-2 MCCB\nBS EN 61009-1 RCBO 30mA\nBS 88 HRC Fuses\nBS 3036 Rewireable Fuse\nBS 1361 Cartridge Fuse\n\nAll the data is stored locally on the phone so no Internet connection is ever required.\n\nIf you like this app, please rate it.

      "label": "Wild flowers is an application which allows you to identify with ease 1764 wild flowers of France and Western Europe. \n\nAll the photos are included in the software. You can thus use Wild flowers during your walks in nature, and you do not need a connection to internet to show the images.\nPlease note that flowers presented in this app are present in France. Most of them are present in a big part of the Western Europe around France. (see distribution maps)\n\nSeveral modes of use are possible.\n- An assistant allows you to select criteria as the color, the shape of leaves or the shape of flowers. So, you can reduce the search to a limited number of species, and even identify directly a flower, in certain cases.\n- A list by name, latin name, or both family and name is available.\n- You can also look for a word (name, latin name or family) while typing it in a text field on the home page.\n- Distribution maps.\n- Ellenberg's indicator values (available for more than 80% of the species listed.)\n- You can write personal notes\n- You can share/save your personal notes by email\n- You can send the description of a flower by email (the button is at the end of the description)\nFor every species, a short description is available, as well as the main parameters (size, color, flowering, etc.).\nAt any time, you can show all the representatives of certain genus or certain family.\n\nPlease note that English language is not our mother language. Therefore, English text is a bit reduced compared to the description in French. Please apologize for this !\n\nAnd finally, a glossary resumes some important terms of botany which could be vague for the beginners.\n\nTo be the most effective possible on the little screen of your device, photos presented for every species were optimized with the aim of showing every time at least an inflorescence and a characteristic leaf of the species, in close-up.\n\nIn spite of all the precautions taken during the elaboration of this software, errors can still exist in our database. If you notice an obvious error, you contact us (contact form available at http://fleursenpoche.antiopa.info/fleursenpoche or directly into the app)\n\nWild flowers will then be corrected in the next version."

With all of the Rosary prayers from the official Vatican website inside, and the easy to use controls, you can view each daily prayer in one of four display styles.

Each mystery is depicted in living color with beautiful pictures, or, if you prefer, you can add pictures from your personal photo album as well. This gorgeous art work is accompanied by Bible passages to help you reflect more deeply on each event. However, if you have a scripture which is a personal favorite, you can add your own text. \n\nMake your Holy Rosary Deluxe more personal by changing the beads to the color of your choice.

Each prayer bead is marked with a number so you can easily monitor your progress through the Rosary. \n\nThis app even remembers where you stopped during your last prayer and resumes where you left off when you return. If you accidentally skip ahead, you can easily go back to the proper bead to finish your prayer. When you're praying the new Novena feature, you can turn the Divine Mercy Chaplet on or off. The choice is yours.\n\nHoly Rosary Deluxe is the most versatile prayer app on the market, today. Everything you need is in one convenient place, so you can pray the Rosary where and when you choose.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Choose from four different display styles to pray the Holy Rosary and the Chaplet.\n- Each mystery has an image that helps to reflection of his events.

Fantastic photos, songs, calls, distribution maps and detailed information for over 200 birds - all the common and best known birds in Britain arranged by family or alphabetically. The specially written bird notes cover the appearance, habitat, diet, lifespan, nesting habits, rarity status, and distribution in Britain, as well as interesting facts. \n\nThe photo-based Bird Finder will quickly identify a mystery bird, then you can mark it as seen, add your own photos, and make a note about it. Automatically note the current date, time, latitude, longitude and Grid Reference. The app includes iCloud syncing, so that if you have more than one device (iPhone, iPod or iPad) your sightings will automatically synchronise.\n\n\"I don't say this often, but you guys should charge more for this neat little piece of work! I almost feel guilty now, for the price!\" - AppStore review\n\nGreat features! This is the ONLY budget British bird app with the following features: \n• A photo-based BIRD FINDER based on appearance, habitat, location, date and more \n• Carefully selected photos of MALES, FEMALES and JUVENILES, to show the main features \n• Labelled photos of KEY FEATURES \n• A COMPARE IMAGES feature \n• A SONG or CALL for EVERY BIRD \n• A HISTORY feature to make it easy to go back to the last bird you looked at \n• Select the birds for the area WHERE YOU LIVE \n• European distribution maps for EVERY BIRD \n• A BACK-UP system so you can save your data \n• iCLOUD syncing to synchronise your sightings across your devices \n\nThe Pocket Birds app includes birds that are likely to be seen without making a special trip, plus well-known species.

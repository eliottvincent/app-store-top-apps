With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop. And with over 20 built-in themes and the ability to create your own, you can customize the results exactly the way you want.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Focus Filters and Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy"

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

      "label": "Need to quickly detect wood studs hidden under drywall, plasterboard, or stucco in order to safely and securely hang a picture, shelf, TV or other wall fixture? Studfinder turns your mobile device into a stud detector tool! Studfinder uses your device's compass (magnetometer) sensor to precisely pinpoint metal studs, nails, screws, and other metal conducting fasteners in wood studs located beneath the drywall, plasterboard, or sheetrock in every wall. A stud detector is essential for securely hanging heavy wall fixtures by ensuring the fasteners are well anchored in the wall studs. \n\nStudfinder operates in a similar manner to other hand-held stud detector tools: LED lights light up in sequence with proximity to stud as your device's magnetometer passes over the stud. However, because modern mobile devices do not have density sensors (which are used by real studfinder tools) Studfinder uses your compass (magnetometer) sensor to detect subtle changes in the background magnetic fields caused by conductive metal fasteners embedded in all studs. Because of the lack of a density sensor in mobile devices, studfinder apps cannot detect wood studs themselves, but rather, detect the metal fasteners embedded in them. Please keep this difference in mind when using Studfinder. \n\nFeatures:\n- Automatic sensor check\n- Active detection button\n- Stability indicator (Green LED)\n- 3 detection level indicators (Red LEDs)\n- 10 sensitivity levels (for various drywall thicknesses)\n- Toggle-able detection beeper\n- Easy to follow, in-app instructions\n\n\nThanks for downloading and using Studfinder. I have constantly been updating and improving it since 2013, based on user feedback, in order to make it the most accurate, responsive, and easy to use stud finder app on the market. Please consider reviewing the app so future versions can be even further improved!"

      "label": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features."

      "label": "The iPhone speed radar - easy-to-use speed measurement in your pocket, anytime, anywhere!\n\nA unique, advanced app designed to easily measure the speed of cars, boats, skaters, skiers, cyclists, animals, models, footballs, tennis serves, etc. The system is based on motion detection, enabling you to track a moving object using a hand-held device alone. SpeedClock includes three separate speed measurement tools and two distance estimation tools.   \n\nSpeed Radar  \nSpeedClock uses the camera to detect and analyze motion, and a reference distance to calculate the speed of an object. Define the distance to the object of interest, hold the iPhone still and let the object pass across the the screen. The speed is displayed automatically. SpeedClock is also able to automatically measure the speed and save an image of passing objects. The measurement can be initiated from an Apple Watch and the speed displayed on the watch face.\n\n  High Speed Video Recording \nAn additional speed tool records and processes a video, which enables SpeedClock to track small, fast object, such as flying balls, that can be difficult to catch with regular motion detection.   It also calculates additional parameters like acceleration.\n\nSynchronized Timing Gates \nA third speed instrument uses two iPhone/iPads equipped with motion detection to start and stop the timer and measure the speed. The distance between the devices is used as reference, and the speed is calculated based on the time taken by the object to travel between the 'Start' and 'Stop' devices. The time is transmitted wirelessly over WiFi or Bluetooth.\n\n  Distance Measurement \n The stadimeter uses the size of a known object, e.g. a car, to calculate the distance.  The clinometer uses your own height as reference, along with the angle of the iPhone, to estimate the distance to a point on the ground.  The distances obtained from either tool can then be used to calculate the speed.  \n\nSee a demo video at the application website (www.appmaker.se/speedClock)\n\nON LINE REVIEWS\n“All I can say is, Fantastic”\nhttp://www.madxperts.com/2010/12/03/measure-speed-app-speedclock-iphone-download/\n\n\"Wow, how cool is that!\"\nhttp://www.ithinkdiff.com/turn-iphone-speed-measuring-gun-speedclock-download/\n\n\"You really going to like this app\"\ndailyappshow.com/speedclock (video)\n\n\"A useful utility for anyone needing to measure speed\"\nappmodo.com/44581/\n\n\"Useful, easy to use and quite a bit of fun (4 of 5)\"\nappvader.com/2011/03/review-speedclock-iphone/\n\n\"speedClock is a useful app when you need to check the speed of yourself, or an object for exercise, racing or simple curiosity (4.5 of 5)\"\nwww.cooliphoneipadapps.com/2010/12/speedclock.html\n\n\"Astonishing\"\niphonelife.com/blog/5/speedclock-velocity-radar-099-app-lets-you-use-camera-measure-speed-objects\n\n\"It is a pleasure to use and operate.

      "label": "Measure indoor room temperature using your iPhone or iPad and headset (required).\n\nOndo® is an experimental acoustic thermometer implemented using an iPhone (or iPad) and headset. Acoustic thermometers utilise the principle that the speed of sound in air changes with temperature; by measuring the speed of sound it is possible to calculate air temperature.\n\nHow it works?\nOndo® transmits a high frequency sound from the headset earpiece. This sound is received by the microphone positioned a short, fixed distance from the earpiece. The time taken for the sound to travel between the earpiece and the microphone is very accurately measured to less than a millionth of a second. \n\nWhat you will need to build your acoustic thermometer:\n• Standard Apple headset (EarPods with lightning connector)\n• Old credit or debit card (to provide a base)\n• Four elastic bands (to hold the right earpiece and microphone in position)\n• iPhone or iPad with Ondo® installed\n\nGetting started:\n• Follow the simple instructions in the app (or on the website www.ondo.app) to build your headset thermometer\n• Calibrate to the starting temperature and your thermometer is ready to use\n• Move the phone and headset to a different temperature zone e.g. take it outside or move nearer to a heater and watch the reading change\n\nSpecification:\n• Temperature range -40 to 50 degrees Celsius\n• Accuracy +/- 1 degree (dependent upon headset fixing)\n\nPLEASE NOTE - This app will only work with a headset connected and set up according to the instructions in the app. Please do not buy this app if you do not have a suitable headset. This app will not work with AirPods."

      "label": "Need to quickly detect wood studs hidden under drywall, plasterboard, or stucco in order to safely and securely hang a picture, shelf, TV or other wall fixture? Studfinder turns your mobile device into a stud detector tool! Studfinder uses your device's compass (magnetometer) sensor to precisely pinpoint metal studs, nails, screws, and other metal fasteners embedded in all wooden wall studs. A stud detector is essential for DIYs to securely hanging heavy wall fixtures and ensures the fasteners are well anchored in the solid wall studs hidden beneath the drywall.\n\nThis app operates in a similar manner to other hand-held stud detector tools: as you move the device along the wall, the LED lights light up in sequence as your device's magnetometer approaches the stud. However, modern mobile devices do not have a density sensor (which is used in real studfinder tools), so Studfinder uses your compass (magnetometer) sensor instead. The compass sensor detects subtle changes in the background magnetic fields caused by the conductive metal fasteners that are located in all wooden studs. Because of the lack of a density sensor in mobile devices, studfinder apps cannot detect wood studs themselves, but instead, detect the metal fasteners in the studs. Please keep this difference in mind when using Studfinder. \n\nFeatures:\n- Automatic sensor check\n- Active detection button\n- Stability indicator (Green LED)\n- 3 detection level indicators (Red LEDs)\n- 10 sensitivity levels (for various drywall thicknesses)\n- Toggle-able detection beeper\n- Easy to follow, in-app DIY instructions\n\nThere is also a quick video tutorial that shows how the app works on my website: http://toadlybroodle.ca/portfolio/apps/stud-finder-app/\n\nThanks for downloading and using my app. I have constantly been updating and improving it since 2013, based on user feedback, in order to make it the most accurate, responsive, and easy to use stud finder app on the market. Please consider reviewing the app so future versions can be even further improved!"

      "label": "Lookscope is a revolutionary solution for your wardrobe hassles. Using the app to manage your closet and outfits will feel like cycling to a destination instead of walking.\n\nThe app allows you to import photos of clothes and accessories in seconds and makes it very easy and quick to explore possible outfits based on the existing and wished for items in your digital closet, just with swipes. Make sure you use this feature to simulate possible outfits and discover stylish ways of wearing before you buy new items!\n\nYou can also save your favorite outfits to build your own outfit portfolio. You will never need to re-think what to wear for work, dates, weddings, interviews, and other special occasions. :)\n\n\nWHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CLOSET APPS\n 1. Simple and basic aesthetics\n 2. Unlimited closet and lookbook spaces\n 3. Automatic outfit generation and filters optimized for speed (and saving time!)\n 4. Automatic backup of closet and favorite outfits data in your iCloud account\n 5. No need for any extra login (an iCloud login with your phone is sufficient)\n\n\nSUMMARY OF FEATURES IN DETAIL\n1. Closet\n- See the collection of your existing and wished for clothes and accessories\n- Edit profiles of clothes and accessories easily with intuitive, button-based UI elements\n- Use the WISH button to indicate wished for items after importing photos of clothes you are interested in buying.

Add Item\n- Download sample items to quickly fill your closet with essential items (Available for only men at the moment, but we are working on doing something similar for women clothes as well!)\n- Import photos of your existing or wished for items from your phone's Photo Library\n- Resize and crop imported photos\n- Edit colors of photos with filter buttons and sliders\n- Edit backgrounds of photos with automatic or intuitive background removal tools\n- Create a profile for your new item easily with intuitive, button-based UI elements.

Il drone potrebbe non mantenere la posizione a causa del limite imposto dal suo hardware e potrebbe essere necessario correggerlo usando i vostri pollici. \n\nVolare in alto richiede una maggiore abilità ed un'ottima vista\n\nUsare TelloUp è semplicissimo:\n\n1) Accendete il vostro Tello\n2) Collegatevi con il vostro Iphone alla sua rete wi-fi\n3) Avviate TelloUp\n4) Tramite la barra orizzontale potete regolare la nuova altitudine\n5) Premete il pulsante INVIA\n6) Il vostro Tello da questo momento in poi volerà fino alla nuova altitudine\n\nN.B.\nTelloUp non è l'app ufficiale ma un'app di terze parti a solo scopo  di test; usala a tuo rischio e pericolo\n\nBuon divertimento"

      "label": "Rowmote lets you seamlessly control audio, video, and presentation applications on your Mac from your iOS device.\n\nYou love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.\n\nOr, your Mac didn’t come with a remote control or doesn’t even have an infrared port. Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n\nRowmote is a steal! Couple it with Apple’s free Remote app to turn your iPhone or iPod Touch into the ultimate controller for home stereo, mobile presentation, or casual video viewing.\n\nThe artwork of Rowmote was designed by Rik Schennink."

Length, distance, area of any surface… Measure everything with this virtual ruler and tape measure thanks to augmented reality. \n\nMeasuring a length is now easier than with a laser meter or any other measure tool. You draw your measurement lines in 3D thanks to the camera directly on the video of your phone or tablet. You export your plans in PDF, PNG or DXF. CamToPlan is the AR measuring app that brings your measures from cam…to…plan !\n\nFor personal or professional use, always measure like a pro. Thanks to Virtual Reality (VR), you can measure floors, dimensions of walls, windows, doors or a whole home in a few seconds. No more tape measure or ruler needed!\n\nThis app has infinite applications for everybody:\n- Personal use: the length measure app for the handyman who loves DIY !\n- Real estate professionals (real estate agent, interior design decorator or designer, architect, topographer, energy adviser...): this app will help you make a floorplan of a house, apartment, a specific room of a flat.\n- Construction workers can use it to quickly measure jobs : concreter, tile layer, carpet fitter, painter, drywall guy, plasterer, builder, carpenter, electrician, plumber, slater... \n- For gardener, landscaper, swimming pool builders and maintenance, digger, earth-moving, navvy: this app also works outside\n- Cost estimation professionals: this length measure app can make pricing estimates, it will be a great assistant for quantity surveyor, price studies technician, economist…\n- Building industry: foreman, site manager or engineer can drop their tape measure and ruler to perform a quick measurement check\n\nHow does this measuring app work?\nIt relies on ARKit by Apple. Machine learning algorithms combine the device sensors data (accelerometer, gyroscope…) with odometry which analyses in real time the video of the camera and relies on visual details of images, in order to scan the environment and find the position and rotation angle of the device.\n\nPlease note: \n- you can measure in metric (meters, centimeters) or imperial units (feet, inches)\n- the app measures distances horizontally (= on the ground) and vertically!\n- no need to remove the furniture from the room for measurements. The application determines the intersection between the floor and the target, even if it is hidden.\n- The application may have difficulty with some types of tiles.\n- The accuracy is not guaranteed.\n- you can move while performing measurements to get closer to your target point, for maximum precision, even if it is not visible and calculated by extrapolation."

      "label": "With SatFinder you can adjust your satellite antenna in a few seconds and with 4 simple steps:\n\nSTEP 1 - CHOOSE YOUR ANTENNA\nChoose one of the four different antenna designs: \n - Offset antennas (the most common, is slightly oval, the LNB is not in the center).\n - Special design (e.g. Oblong shaped Offset antenna, Multifeed antenna)  \n - Parabolic antenna (LNB is located in the center of the reflector, usually larger than 100cm)\n - Flat or planar antenna (small, camping antennas)\n\nIf you have an offset antenna, enter the height and width of the antenna. If your antenna has a special shape, enter the offset angle and the size of the satellite antenna. You can find the offset angle in the manual of your satellite antenna. For parabolic antennas it is sufficient to enter the antenna diameter. With a flat antenna you do not have to set anything. If you know the exact antenna name, check if your antenna is already in the database.\n\nTip: Press the wizard button to measure the size of the satellite antenna using the iPhone camera and LiDAR scanner. \n\nSTEP 2 - CHOOSE YOUR SATELLITE\nTo quickly and easily select a suitable satellite, simply press the \"AUTO\" button. The SatFinder will now automatically search for satellites that are in your reception area and that offer TV or radio stations in your language (the language setting of your iPhone will be selected). The stars (1-10) shown in the table result from the number of radio and TV channels offered and the reception strength at your location.  \n\nIf you want to receive a special satellite, switch off \"AUTO\": Now you can simply scroll through the table and select the satellite. Faster is the search function - just enter the name of the satellite, the channel or the orbit position. You can also reduce the number of table entries by hiding satellites that are not available at your location or do not broadcast in your language. With the button \"Channel Info\" you can check which channels the selected satellite is currently broadcasting - including all channel parameters for your satellite receiver.  \n\nSTEP 3 - CHECK OBSTACLES\nFor a smooth satellite reception, there must not be any obstacles between the satellite and your satellite antenna. You can check this with the \"View\" function. Simply aim at the satellite and watch the signs (GREEN - no obstacle, RED - caution, free view may not be given).\n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 4 - ADJUST ANTENNA\nIn the menu item \"Align\" different graphics appear depending on the selected antenna type. If you use an offset antenna, you have to adjust the azimuth and elevation separately. With planar or parabolic antennas the adjustment of the angles is done together. Before you press the \"Start\" button, a video clip shows how to position your iPhone at the antenna. \n\nTip: Press the button for the assistant to activate the voice output.\n\nSTEP 5 - FINE TUNING \nIf necessary, you can optimize the reception of your satellite system. The SatFinder provides you with the function \"FineTuning\". To use this function, you need a second iOS device. One device serves as a camera; the second device as a monitor. Simply place an iPhone in front of your reception screen and observe changes in picture quality while slightly rotating or tilting your satellite antenna. With the FineTuning feature, you'll have visual contact with your TV even when you're out of sight. \n\nTHAT'S IT. YOU SHOULD NOW BE ABLE TO ENJOY INTERFERENCE-FREE SATELLITE RECEPTION... \nNote: Satellite antenna tuning is only available on iOS devices with LiDAR sensor (e.g. iPhone 12 Pro)."

Thank you for saving me from myself!\n\nPerfect App - 5 Stars\nby Jenniferw83 - Version 2.00 - May 29 2010\nThis app is perfect, and not just for when you are drunk. It's good to keep me from calling or texting an ex right after we break up. Every time I get the urge to text just cause I put his number on drunk dial no for 48 hours and by the time the 48 hours goes by the urge is gone. If not then I put him on it for another 48 hours!\n----------------\n\nTO START:\n - Tap the '+' button\n - Choose one of your contacts\n - Drunk Dial NO! will store the contact's phone number(s) and email address(es) for between 1 and 48 hours\n - NO EXCUSES! NO BEGGING!\n - After between 1 and 48 hours, run Drunk Dial NO! again to restore stored contact(s)\n\nTO TEST:\n - Create a contact called 'Test Person'\n   (first name: Test, last name: Person)\n - Add some fake phone and email entries for 'Test Person'\n - Choose 'Test Person' contact in Drunk Dial NO!\n - 'Test Person' is only stored for 5 minutes\n\nTO SEND YOURSELF A MESSAGE:\n - Tap the Compose button\n - Enter an important message you don't want to forget\n - The message will be sent to your device after the number of hours you enter\n\nTO TURN ON INCOMING BLOCKING:\n - In the Settings App\n - Goto Phone > Call Blocking & Identification\n - Make sure Drunk Dial NO! is turned On\n\nNote: If you've got contacts which Drunk Dial NO! is blocking, don't delete Drunk Dial NO! until you've restored the contacts using Drunk Dial NO! (of course, hopefully you'll like Drunk Dial NO! so much that you won't delete it!)\n\nFollow us on twitter @explorefun\n\nAll comments/suggestions welcomed to: info@explorefun.com"

      "label": "iCab Mobile is a web browser for the iOS. It provides many unique and useful features you won't find in other iPhone browsers.\n\nAPPLE WATCH:\nThe Watch App is a remote control for iCab Mobile, so you can navigate, zoom, scroll, open bookmarks, links, the homepage, switch tabs or sitch on/off the fullscreen mode. Since watchOS 6.2 you can also open web pages and browse the Web directly on the Apple Watch. But there are a few limitations: The watchOS will always show a privacy warning when starting a browsing session and there are no navigation buttons (back/forward) available.\n\nFILE UPLOADS:\niCab Mobile can upload any files on web pages.\n\nSEARCHING:\niCab Mobile comes with several default search engines you can choose from. You can easily add new search engines. \n\nFILLING OUT FORMS:\niCab Mobile can save web forms and restore the form content later (manually or automatically). The saved forms data can be password protected. Supports many third-party Password Manager Apps as well.\n\nFILTERS:\nThere’s a built-in fully customizable filter feature. It allows to block resources, ads, banners, user tracking scripts, cookies etc. Supports AdBlock Plus/EasyList filters as well.\n\nTABS:\niCab Mobile supports Tabs, so you can open multiple web pages at the same time. Links can be opened in Tabs (in the foreground or background) manually or automatically. \n\nBOOKMARKS:\nBookmarks can be organized in folders. You can import/export the bookmarks from/to your PC/Mac browser. \n\nFULLSCREEN MODE:\niCab Mobile provides a fullscreen mode where the whole screen is used to display the web page. No screen space is wasted for toolbars. \n\nDOWNLOADS:\niCab Mobile has a built-in Download Manager so you can download almost all files from the internet. The downloads can be easily transfered to a Mac/PC/Linux computer but also to other Apps on the device which can open these files\n\nMULTIUSER SUPPORT\nYou can create multiple user accounts, each user has its own private bookmarks, filters, settings, etc.\n\nDROPBOX\niCab Mobile supports Dropbox. Export/Import bookmarks; transfer downloads, images, files, web pages to your Dropbox account.\n\nTWIN BROWSER:\nIn this mode, you can have two browsers side by side on the iPad. This is especially useful on the large iPad Pro.\n\nVOICEOVER\nThe App is also accessible for visually impaired and blind users. If VoiceOver is enabled, the App plays soft ticks while a page is loading, so blind users are able to identify when the page load has finished. \n\nOTHER FEATURE:\n- Configurable multi-touch gestures\n- QuickStarter feature\n- AirPrint support \n- Browser ID (UserAgent) is configurable\n- iCab Mobile fully supports international domain names\n- Cookie Manager\n- Private Browsing (no history and no cookies are stored)\n- Privacy settings allows to delete all kinds of private data (history, cookies, databases, saved forms, passwords etc.)\n- URL autocompletion \n- Simple built-in RSS reader\n- Save images, whole web pages, PDF files\n- Kiosk Mode - a restricted variation of the fullscreen mode for Kiosk environments. \n- History\n- Addressbook support lets you access the web pages from the addressbook. \n- When launching iCab can either open an empty page, the homepage or restore the Tabs which were open the last time\n- There are different color schemes and designs\n- Document Sharing lets you pass downloads and files to other Apps in the device\n\n\n\nThe App includes a store providing several InApp purchases. These are meant as a tip jar. The InApp purchases are available for different prices, so you can pick the amount for the tip yourself. Doing so will unlock a few cool features as a reward, these are always the same, regardless of the amount of the tip. Users who have purchased the App within the last 12 months do get all these features for free, no need to buy one of the InApp purchases. Though they can nevertheless give me a tip, if they want to... ;-)"

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback."

Simple one-time payment\n• Top Utility ranked in all App Stores around the world \n• Over 1000+ carefully crafted filters\n• Easy setup in under 1 minute with detailed tutorial\n• Now with built-in Safari Content Blocker for better web ad protection\n\nWeblock allows you to control how your device fetches online content. Easily manage PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) script and route different connections through different proxy servers. Weblock can make your device download ads (banners and popups), stats and user tracking, scripts or images through a proxy server you pick. It also allows you to use a different proxy for specific websites, like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, social widgets from websites. You can even define your own content filters. With Weblock you can control proxy for basically any network resource! This way you can choose not to reveal your real IP to different services, limit advanced ad targeting and protect your privacy.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: You're responsible for selecting a proxy server that allows you to download content you wish to download. We DO NOT provide a proxy service. Using a bad proxy server (like 127.0.0.1:8021) might result in some resources being blocked. You can control your proxy settings selectively with Weblock. Contact our support if you need help choosing right proxy server or setting up Weblock on your device.\n\nHere are some situations in which Weblock might come in handy:\n• Fetch ads through a proxy server you choose. Protect your privacy and prevent ad servers from knowing your real IP address and tracking you.\n• Disable majority of ads on websites you visit on your iOS device! Weblock supports all major web browsers: Safari, Chrome, Mercury and others (browsers redirecting web traffic through third-party servers like Puffin Browser or Opera Mini are not be supported).\n• Easily remove all native Facebook widgets and plugins (Like buttons, comments, etc.) on sites you visit - simply disable Facebook plugins in Weblock! Do the same for Twitter, Google+ and other social media.\n• Stop annoying Tapatalk popups, nagging you to download forum browsing app on every visit.\n• Take control of someone else's device - you can preconfigure any iOS device to control it with your Weblock app. Block or redirect any content, anytime, directly from your own device.\n• Your predefined filters and custom rules can be synced between all your iOS devices using iCloud.\n• If you wish to block something else, you can create your own rules and filters. You can block any URL (with regular expressions), domain or IP address. Don't know how? Let us know - we're here for you.\n• You can also use Weblock's redirect feature to emulate '/etc/hosts' entries for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This might be useful for web and app developers to pin domains to different IP addresses.\n\n••• IMPORTANT! •••\nNeed help setting up Weblock? Contact our support directly through the app."

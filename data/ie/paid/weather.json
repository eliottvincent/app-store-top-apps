      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

It lets you know what the weather's going to be like where you are, and also shows you what the weather's like right now in any part of the world. With audio added, you can hear the current forecast for your location and all of the Glossary phrases in beautiful spoken Irish.\n\nAimsir (pronounced 'am-sher', the Irish word for 'weather') uses data from OpenWeatherMap to give accurate and detailed current and five day forecasts for your present location. Aimsir's forecasts also provide information on wind strength and direction, atmospheric pressure, cloud cover and humidity. \n\nOn the \"Timpeall an Domhain\" (Around the World) screen, you can click on any location on the planet and the current weather will be displayed - in Irish. You can also share this forecast on Social Media.\n\nThe \"Tíortha an Domhain\" (Countries of the World) screen lists the name of each country - and its capital city - in the Irish Language. Selecting a particular country will display it on a map and also show the present weather conditions in the capital city.\n\nIn addition to providing weather information, the aim of the app is to present the user with as wide range of much Irish language vocabulary as possible. Aimsir includes a detailed glossary section where all of the words and phrases used are spoken in Irish and also translated into English. There are also useful tools that allow you select numbers and dates and hear them spoken - as well as seeing them written - in Irish. \n\nAimsir is the perfect tool to brush up your Irish language skills or maybe just learn a few words.\n\n'Bain Triail As!'  (Give it a try!)."

Tidal information is essential for navigating a shallow waterway or placing your boat at anchor.  The success or failure of a voyage can depend on the height or depth of a tide, while knowledge of current information can save fuel and make passage into a river or channel safer. \n\nTides PRO goes further than the tables provided by the NOAA. The app automatically accounts for correction factors and provides instant information without requesting that you account for time lags, daylight savings conventions, or height differences between the reference stations and the locations you are seeking. \n\nSince the tidal information that is published in this app is not subjected to the use of the voyage, please do not use for navigation."

      "label": "Weather forecasts and radar for weather nerds!\n\n*****\nFeatured by Apple, MacRumors, CNet, App Advice and more!  \"Weather Nerd is a comprehensive package in a gorgeous wrapper.\"\n*****\n\nWHAT'S NEW?\n\n - Optimized for All Sizes of Devices\n - Siri Support\n - Bolder, Larger Text\n - Tons of New Measurements Like Humidity, Pressure, etc\n - Forecasts for Your Calendar Events\n\nTOP FEATURES\n\n - Detailed daily reports (up to a year out)\n - Minute-to-minute precipitation (see coverage below)\n - Weather radar and satellite\n - 3 widgets (next hour, day, week)\n\nPurchase includes one year full access. After a year, you can renew via an in-app purchase. \n\n########################################\n\nCOVERAGE\n\nWeather reports are available for nearly anywhere in the world. If in doubt, go to http://darksky.net and try your location to see if you like the report.\n\nRadar is currently North America only.\n\nThe hour forecast is currently limited to US, UK, Ireland.\n\n\nDAILY COMPARISON\n\nWhen you're getting dressed, what do you want to know?\n\n\"How does today compare with yesterday?\"\n\nWeather Nerd includes a nice daily comparison:\n\n\"Today is 9° cooler than yesterday. No rain.\"\n\nThis makes it easy to grab the right coat.\n\n\nMINUTE-TO-MINUTE FORECAST\n\nWeather Nerd also gives you minute-by-minute rain predictions for your exact GPS location. Powered by Dark Sky's cutting edge \"hyperlocal precipitation forecasting system\", these reports show you a nice graph of the rain intensity for the next hour based on your exact location.  For example, you might see:\n\n\"Light rain starting in 10 minutes, stopping 15 minutes later.\"\n\n\nDAILY FORECAST\n\nThe daily forecast screen shows you a graph of the temperature, rain, and wind for today. Touch anywhere on the graph to view the forecast for a specific time. See more details at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\nWEEKLY FORECAST\n\nThe weekly forecast shows you a quick graph of the projected highs and lows for the next week, along with the chance of rain. Touch any day to view the full forecast for that day.\n\n\nBEYOND 7 DAYS\n\nNeed to see the forecast for two weeks or two months out? No problem. Weather Nerd's calendar lets you view the forecast for any date within the next year. \n\n\nNERD OUT\n\nFor the real weather nerds, the \"Nerd Out\" feature will list out ALL of the weather information.\n\n\nNERD ALERTS\n\nWeather Nerd lets you setup a daily weather forecast alert (in 15 minute intervals). You can turn the alert on/off for certain days of the week.\n\nIf you set your alert to 6pm or later, then the forecast will be for \"tomorrow's\" weather.\n\n\nNERD WIDGETS\n\nSome of you nerds like to use iPhone and iPad widgets. No problem. Weather Nerd comes packaged with 3 different widgets for your viewing pleasure including graphs for the \"Next Hour\", \"Today\", and \"Week\".\n\n\n========================\n\nWhy a subscription? The average nerd checks weather 4-5 times a day. Over a year, that alone cost nearly 1 USD to our providers. That's not counting additional data used for radar tiles, alerts, widgets, multiple devices, servers, etc. It would be completely unsustainable to charge a one time fee for a lifetime of data.\n\nWeather Nerd uses auto-renewing subscriptions. The Nerd Club subscription provides full access to weather reports, radar, widgets, and notifications. The subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase within the app. Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of your subscription period and will be charged through your iTunes account. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time from your iTunes account settings. Cancellation of the current active subscription period is not allowed. \n\nTerms of Use: http://www.allstarapps.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy Policy:  http://www.allstarapps.com/privacy-policy"

      "label": "What time is sunset today? Or sunrise tomorrow? When is the \"magic hour\" next March 20 in Paris? With Sol, you can check times and get reminders of solar events, at home or while traveling! Great for everyone looking to plan activities based on sunlight. Use it to remind you to walk the dog before dark, get up with the sun, or find golden hour time for that perfect photo.\n\nSol: Sun Clock is the Swiss-army knife of sunlight tools with a design inspired by the simplicity of the sundial. Use it to plan your day, guide natural sleep cycles, get the best light for outdoor photography, make sure animals or kids are safe inside before dark, or to map out the best times to go running or fishing. \n\n* Be in tune: Sol will tell you when the golden hour is, how much sunlight you have left in the day or what time the next sunrise occurs.\n\n* Look to the future, travel around the world: Sol lets you find sunlight information for any date, anywhere on earth. \n \n* Find solar midnight and solar noon, and all three twilight (dawn and dusk) periods: astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight. Keep tabs on the next solstice and equinox.\n \n* Reminders and Alarms: Use Sol as a natural alarm clock that you can set to any event (like sunset, golden hour or solar noon), and the alarm or reminder time will adjust gradually as the days change with the seasons.\n \n* Automatic Location: Sol not only calculates the amount of daylight and sunrise and sunset times, but does so for any location in the world (both Northern and Southern hemispheres) by using your device's GPS... no network connection required. \n\n* Other locations: Optionally, use the built-in map to choose any location in the world by moving the pin, or search using the name of any city.\n \n* Optional location-aware alarms. Sol knows when you change with your location; and as you travel it will adjust any alarms you set relative to sunrise and sunset times.  Create alarms for multiple locations around the world.\n\n* Detailed almanac information: Useful information about the day's length, sun's azimuth and elevation, equinoxes and solstices, and a friendly glossary that explains all the terms. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. However, GPS runs in the background ONLY if you have set location-aware alarms."

Do not hesitate to contact us and let us know your difficulties and suggestions!\n\n* Key Features *\n=> Forecasts in a Map: quickly get a glimpse of the weather across the island, by viewing the forecast icons overlaid onto a map. Use the zoom to view full resolution.\n=> All places: browse through a list of forecasts organized by locality. Besides icons representing the weather you may also view the predicted values for temperature, humidity and wind. Consult the legend for details on each icon.\n=> More details: access more detailed weather information in each locality.\n=> Favorites: want browse forecasts in a list of locations of your choice? Open sites individually and add them to your ‘Favorites’ list.\n=> Satellite images: use this option to view the satellite images from EUMETSAT-RGB, centered over Madeira Archipelago. Sequence of images usually hosts data for three consecutive days, with snapshots available several times a day.\n=> Time-navigation for up to three days, with hourly forecasts for all your favorite locations. Beyond three days any forecasting system becomes too unreliable to trust.\n\n* Some Notes *\nForecasts are mathematical calculations and should be used with care. In fact, the information provided by ANY prediction systems is only indicative.

      "label": "Thanks to everyone for making MyRadar so successful, with over 50 million downloads!\n\nMyRadar Pro is IDENTICAL to the free version of MyRadar; it comes without the ads by default.\n\nMyRadar is a fast, powerful, easy-to-use weather app that displays animated weather radar around your current location and to quickly show what weather is coming your way. Just start the app; your location pops up with animated live radar, with radar loop lengths of up to two hours. This basic functionality provides the quickest way to get a snapshot of the weather on-the-go, and it's what has made MyRadar so successful over the years. Check your phone and get an instant assessment of the weather that will impact your day.\n\nIn addition to the live radar, MyRadar has an ever-increasing list of weather and environmentally-related data layers that you can overlay on top of the map;  our animated winds layer shows a breathtaking visual representation of both surface winds and winds at the jetstream level; the frontal boundaries layer shows high and low pressure systems as well as frontal boundaries themselves; the earthquakes layer is a great way to stay on top of the latest reports on seismic activity, completely customizable as to severity and time; our hurricane layer allows users to stay on top of the latest tropical storm and hurricane activity throughout the world; the aviation layer overlays AIRMETs, SIGMETs and other aviation-related data, including the ability to track flights and display their IFR flight plans and paths, and the \"wildfires\" layer allows users to stay abreast of the latest fire activity around the United States.\n\nMyRadar also has the ability to send weather and environmental alerts, including alerts from the National Weather Service, such as Tornado and Severe Weather alerts. A new feature introduced in this version of MyRadar includes the ability to receive alerts based off of Tropical  Storm and Hurricane activity;  you can configure the app to send you an alert any time a tropical storm or hurricane forms, or is upgraded or downgraded.\n\nOne of the most useful features in MyRadar is the ability to provide advanced rain alerts; our patent-pending process for predicting hyper-local rainfall is the most accurate in the industry. Instead of having to check the app all the time, MyRadar will send you an alert up to an hour in advance as to when the rain will arrive at your current location, down to the minute, including details on intensity and duration. These alerts can be a life saver when you're on-the-go and don't always have time to check the weather - our systems will proactively do the work for you and let you know in advance before the rain hits.\n\nIn addition to the free features of the app, additional upgrades are available, including real-time hurricane tracking - great for the start of hurricane season. The hurricane tracker provides additional data above and beyond the free version, including the cone of probability for tropical storm/hurricane forecast tracks, and it also includes a detailed synopsis from the National Hurricane Center. The premium upgrades also include the professional radar pack, which allows greater detail of radar from individual stations. Users can select individual radar stations around the US, select the radar tilt angle, and also change the radar product being displayed, including base reflectivity and wind velocity - great for experienced weather buffs looks to stay on top of possible tornado formation.\n\nDownload MyRadar today and try it out!\n* Aviation Charts subscription (not required in order to use MyRadar) ($24.99 USD per YEAR)\n* Payments will be charged to your iTunes account\n* Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n* Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the iTunes Store after purchase.\n\nMyRadar’s Privacy Policy, visit: https://myradar.com/privacy\nFull terms of service: https://myradar.com/terms"

      "label": "Weather Calculations is the only weather calculator you will need.  It contains 6 calculators in one: Heat Index, Wind Chill, Dew Point, Apparent Temperature, Humidex, and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature.\n\nThis calculator handles both imperial and metric units (with built-in unit converter).  Enter the air temperature in Fahrenheit or Celsius.  Enter the wind speed in miles per hour, meters per second, kilometers per hour, or knots.  Many more units included!\n\nCompare various models to see which matches how you perceive the weather.  Explore what-if scenarios to better understand weather modeling.\n\n\n**Heat Index Calculator**\nHeat Index calculates the Heat Index from models by the US National Weather Service.\n\nNotes: Heat Index is defined for temperatures above 80 degrees F (27 degrees C) and relative humidity above 40%.  Calculator may not be accurate outside those ranges.\n\n\n**Wind Chill Calculator**\nWind Chill calculate the wind chill using both the new (post-2001) and old (pre-2001) Windchill Temperature (WCT) index from models by the US National Weather Service.  It also provides the old Windchill Index in kcal/m^2/h.\n\nNotes: Windchill Temperature is defined for temperatures below 50 degrees F (10 degrees C) and wind speeds above 3 mph (4.8 kph or 1.34 m/s).  Calculator may not be accurate outside those ranges.\n\n\n**Dew Point Calculator**\nUnlike some calculators which only calculate the dew point temperature, the Dew Point Calculator will also calculate the air temperature given the dew point temperature and relative humidity as well as calculate the relative humidity given the air temperature and the dew point temperature.\n\nThis calculator uses the more accurate August-Roche-Magnus model and is accurate for temperatures between 32°F (0°C) and 140°F (60°C).\n\n\n**Humidex Calculator**\nHumidex is a quick heat index calculator.  Want to know the effect of humidity on how hot it feels?\n\nHumidex calculates the humidex from models by the Meteorological Service of Canada.\n\n**Apparent Temperature Calculator**\nApparent Temperature uses the three factor model developed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which assumes a sunny day.\n\nThis advanced model works for high and low temperatures, combining the effects of humidity and wind chill into a single 'feels like' apparent temperature.\n\n\n**Wet Bulb Globe Temperature Calculator**\nWet Bulb Globe Temperature is an estimate of how hot it feels with humidity?\n\nEnter the temperature and relative humidity, and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature calculates the WBGTI describing how temperature and humidity feels.  Flag indicators help you to quickly identify the risks of outdoor activities.  These indicators are based on the system used by the USMC (see: http://www.mcrdpi.usmc.mil/weather.asp for more details).\n\nThis WBGT index calculator uses the same approximation as the Australian Bureau of Meteorology for estimating the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature from the air temperature and relative humidity, assuming sunny day and light wind.  On cloudy or windy days, this is an overestimation of how hot it feels."

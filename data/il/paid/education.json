      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day.

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses.

Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

It’s the kind of thing you can imagine a science teacher using in the classroom of the future — except that we don’t have to wait.” - CNet\n \n“Zoom from Mercury to Pluto (which makes the cut in this app), passing each planet’s moons along the way. Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation. Turn into an astronomer and explore planets, moons, satellites, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, stars and other celestial bodies. Enjoy gorgeous graphics and visuals while navigating through the solar system!\n\n► Make virtual flights from one space object to another.\n\n► Travel in time and see what the universe and our Solar system looked like at a certain period.\n\n► Find an exciting view of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n► Watch a collection of educational solar system movies to learn about space-related topics including Earth's moon phases, Earth's cycles, tidal phenomena, and zodiacal constellations.*\n\n► Enjoy 3D planetarium with the help of special glasses and activating the anaglyph mode.\n\n► Share interesting screenshots of the app with your friends.\n\n► Choose the view mode comfortable for you (orrery/true-to-scale).\n\n*Available through In-App Purchases.\n\nSolar Walk is a great educational tool appropriate for both adults and children. The amount of information users can learn about the planets, moons, satellites and other celestial bodies is impressive.

      "label": "Мы поможем вам!\n\nВсего за несколько минут в день вы научитесь составлять предложения на английском, незаметно для себя выучите много новых слов.\n\nИнтенсивный обучающий курс «Полиглот» состоит из 16 занятий. После его завершения любой человек легко сможет разговаривать на английском языке.\n\nСписок занятий:\n\n1.   Базовая форма глагола.\n2.   Местоимения. Вопросительные слова.\n3.   Глагол \"to be\". Предлоги места. Like/Want.\n4.   Притяжательные местоимения.\n5.   Профессии. Этикет.\n6.   Степени сравнения прилагательных. Указательные местоимения.\n7.   Слова-параметры. Употребление much и many.\n8.   Предлоги и параметры времени.\n9.   There is / There are.\n10. Предлоги направления и движения.\n11. Модальные глаголы can, must, should.\n12. Continuous \n13. Прилагательные. Описание людей. Погода\n14. Present Perfect\n15. Повелительное наклонение\n16. Фразовые глаголы\n\nКаждое занятие содержит подробное описание грамматики английского языка по данному уроку.\n \nКак это работает?\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам простые выражения на русском языке.\n\nИз слов на экране вам нужно составить английский перевод.\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ. Правильный ответ озвучивается.\n\nЧтобы перейти к следующему уроку необходимо набрать 4.5 балла в предыдущем уроке. Пока баллы не набраны, уроки остаются заблокированными.\n\nРезультаты синхронизируются через iCloud.\n\nКак рассчитываются баллы?\n\nПрограмма помнит 100 последних ответов, количество ПРАВИЛЬНЫХ ответов делит на 100 и умножает на 5.\nЧтобы набрать 4.5 балла надо ответить правильно на 90 вопросов из 100.\n\nСлишком просто?\n\nТогда включите в настройках повышенный уровень сложности. Программа не будет предлагать вам варианты слов, а попросит ввести предложение с клавиатуры.\n\nЭКЗАМЕН\n\nЭкзамен предназначен для закрепления знаний по пройденным урокам. Также он хорошо подходит, чтобы освежить знания.\n\nПо каждому выбранному уроку составляется 10 заданий. Все задания перемешиваются и предлагаются Вам для выполнения в случайном порядке.\n\nПрограмма запоминает результаты выполнения по каждому из уроков в экзамене. По завершении экзамена выставляется общая оценка и оценка по каждому уроку.\n\nНе надо расстраиваться, если с первого раза Вы не получили максимальную оценку.\n\nЭто просто напоминание, что нужно дополнительно потренироваться в соответствующем уроке. Ведь главная цель данного приложения помочь Вам в изучении английского языка, а не выставление оценки за экзамен.\n\nЕсли вы знаете как улучшить программу, напишите нам !\n\nМы ВКонтакте: http://vk.com/polyglotmobile"

From sunup to sundown, Toca Life: Farm is fun on the farm!\n\nEXPLORE LIFE ON THE FARM\nThe four locations in Toca Life: Farm will give you everything you need to tell your farm stories. Tend to the animals in the barn — feed them and clean up their poop! Once you've taken care of the animals, head to the house, where you can have a meal then grab your banjo for an impromptu jam session. After a good night's sleep head out to the field to tend to your crops. Harvest your produce and head to the store, where you can sell your food, make new products and buy goods!\n\nTURN YOUR HARVEST INTO FOOD\nPlant your seeds and find out how to make them grow! Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

It stars Pogg, a little green alien who can do all sorts of things.\n\nPogg is built on the open question, “What should Pogg do now?”, allowing you to type in whatever you like, and Pogg will most likely be able to do it – type in “run” and he’ll go for a run… type in “cook” and he cooks!\n\nYou can also watch all of Pogg’s actions through Picture Mode, which presents each action as an easy to press icon.\n\nPogg is receiving consistently high ratings from parents, teachers, game reviewers, speech therapists and disability workers. It has found a warm place in the hearts of special education children and their teachers and parents, and received the endorsement of multiple speech therapists as well as being cited in publications as a useful app for helping the language development of special education students.\n\n\"It is without doubt one of the best games for kids I have seen in the App Store. It is creative and useful, and just plain fun.\" (iPhone Footprint review)\n\nIf you like fun, you’ll like Pogg :)"

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

Отображается в правом верхнем углу. Означает количество баллов по текущему слову.\n• Процент изученности. Означает процент изученности слов в словаре.\n\nКАК НАЧИСЛЯЮТСЯ БАЛЛЫ\n\nЗа правильный ответ начисляется 1 балл, за неправильный - снимается 2 балла, при просмотре карточки балл не засчитывается.\n\nПервые три балла начисляются при изучении слова, их можно набрать сразу. После этого слово переходит на повтор и баллы по нему не начисляются пока не настанет время повтора.\n\nЧетвертый балл дается при повторе через 1 день.\nПятый балл дается при повторе  ещё через 3 дня.\n\nИтого, слово может стать выученным на пятый день, если вы набрали 5 баллов.\n\nКАК ЭТО РАБОТАЕТ.\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам на русском языке слово и предложение с этим словом. Вам необходимо ответить, как данное слово в текущем контексте должно быть переведено на английский язык.\n\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ и покажет карточку слова.\nВ любом случае вам будет показан английский вариант предложения.\n\nРазные формы слов учатся и учитываются в статистике независимо. Например, по словам I и me, see и saw подсчёт ведётся отдельно.\n\nКарточку слова можно посмотреть выбрав соответствующий пункт меню.\nПроцесс изучения слов начинается с того, что программа набирает из своего словаря 15 слов и начинает их показывать в случайном порядке.\n\nПосле того, как слово переходит в группу \"повторяемые\" из словаря извлекается следующее слово.\n\nПовтор производится через 1, 2 дня. Время, когда будет показан повтор всегда исчисляется от времени предыдущего ответа.\n\nЕсли вы отвечаете правильно на все повторы, то слово переходит в группу \"выученные\" и больше не будет предлагаться.\nЕсли вы посмотрели карточку, то баллы не начисляются.\n\nСЛОВАРЬ\nНа текущий момент словарь программы содержит около 1500 наиболее употребляемых английских слов, а также слов используемых в программе \"Полиглот\".\nНеправильные глаголы представлены в первой и второй формах. Подсчет баллов по каждой форме идет независимо. Слова в словаре расположены в порядке изучения.\n\nОЗВУЧКА\nДоступно произношение английского предложения."

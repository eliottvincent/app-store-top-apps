      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham."

      "label": "We received the \"Editor´s Choice\" award by Apple for \"Little Fox Animal Doctor\" And in addition our app was awarded the \"Tech with Kids' Best Pick Award\" for exceptional design of a children's app. \n\nLittle Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4. Little Fox Animal Doctor is the first 3D-App by Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger. She is also the creative genius behind Nighty Night, Little Fox Music Box and Nighty Night Circus. Her Apps have been downloaded over 5 million times worldwide.                                                                                                                                  \n\nThe App will make your children’s dreams of being an Animal Doctor come true!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years.

It provides three verbs for each sentence type selected including: catch, eat, fall, go, hide, jump, play, push, sing, and sneeze.  \n\nWant to show animations simply to elicit sentences and verb forms? Just select the \"Watch & Say\" activity--also a great pre/post assessment tool. Select the verbs from 10 choices or random, and choose the target syntax structures. \n\nHere’s how to play the main activity, Build a Sentence:\n1) Choose your subject: There are three character choices in this app: a boy, a girl, and a bear.\n\n2) Then choose your verb: There are always 3 verb choices for Subject + Verb + Object: catch, eat or push. \n\n3) Choose your object or prepositional phrase: The last step is choosing something for the child to eat. \n\n4) The narrator voices each part of the sentence slowly, as the circles flip back around, one at a time, to reveal the associated pictures: “The girl…is eating…a carrot.” \n\nUnless de-selected, the narrator will then model the sentence at a quicker speaking pace, “The girl is eating a carrot.” The child is complimented for the sentence and then instructed, “After the video, it will be YOUR turn to say the sentence.”\n\n5) The animation that shows the sentence that was created (i.e., “The girl is eating a carrot”) is now shown, typically with a sound effect. If the verb is present tense, (which is the default) it snaps back and loops continually, without sound. \n\n6) The child is asked, “What is happening? Tell me the whole sentence.” “ \n\nIf used in therapy, the data tracking features on the left can be used. (This can be de-selected within the settings if no desired)\n\n*If past tense verb forms have been selected, the animation is shown only once and the narrator asks, “What happened?” If the user would like to target the verb only, this can be selected in the settings, with the question being asked, “What is the girl doing?” (or “What did the girl do?” for past tense)\n\n7) A reward game can be played at desired intervals, the “Pop It!” Game. The child touches bubbles on a screen until a selected “prize” is found.\n\n\nPRIVACY POLICY: We do NOT collect personal data from our users and have no ads.

It stars Pogg, a little green alien who can do all sorts of things.\n\nPogg is built on the open question, “What should Pogg do now?”, allowing you to type in whatever you like, and Pogg will most likely be able to do it – type in “run” and he’ll go for a run… type in “cook” and he cooks!\n\nYou can also watch all of Pogg’s actions through Picture Mode, which presents each action as an easy to press icon.\n\nPogg is receiving consistently high ratings from parents, teachers, game reviewers, speech therapists and disability workers. It has found a warm place in the hearts of special education children and their teachers and parents, and received the endorsement of multiple speech therapists as well as being cited in publications as a useful app for helping the language development of special education students.\n\n\"It is without doubt one of the best games for kids I have seen in the App Store. It is creative and useful, and just plain fun.\" (iPhone Footprint review)\n\nIf you like fun, you’ll like Pogg :)"

Изучать новые слова с Умным Малышом очень просто, для этого нужно выбрать раздел из основного меню нажатием на экран и перейти в тематический раздел с 10 картинками. Каждый слайд озвучен приятным женским голосом, а при нажатии увеличивается на полный экран чтобы было проще рассмотреть изображение. \n\nВ игре есть 2 режима:\n* В режиме интерактивного обучения ваш малыш сможет нажать на изображение интересующиего объекта и диктор назовет его голосом. В каждой теме представлено по 10 слайдов.\n* Во время игры диктор голосом задает вопросы, а ребенок должен найти подходяющую картинку. Если малыш ошибся 3 раза, то диктор покажет правильный ответ. В конце каждой игры обязательное поздравления с летающими воздушными шарами, которые можно лопнуть по нажатию.\n\nС использованием двух режимов ребенок не только изучит, но и закрепит свои знания!\n\nВ игре практически нет текстовых надписей, все управление основано на использовании голоса и картинок. Участие родителя в игре вовсе не обязательно и остается на ваше усмотрение.\n\nПодходит для детей от 2 лет."

      "label": "Visual Working For Boards\n\nThe way to ease the anxiety during a scheduled task is by using a working for board. These boards provide some predictability during a scheduled task and allow the children to understand what is coming next. \n\nIt is useful to increase the expectations before the student receives reinforcement. Another natural progression would be to increase the number of scheduled activities that a child is exposed to at one time, often done in a schedule format.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nIt is a simple two-part board that communicates to children what they are doing now and what they will be doing next. The board is effective in letting children know what to expect without overwhelming them with a number of activities. The board can be used to increase motivation by providing a reinforcing activity after an activity that is less reinforcing. For example, first math, then computer.\n\nHow to begin:\n\n• Upon starting an activity, place a representation of the activity with pictures (predefined scheduled series) in the working items section (bottom of the board).\n\n• Tap the working item will display larger picture in the working for section.\n\n• After completing the first activity, remove the picture from the working for section by tapping the next activity in the first (so that it becomes the working for) and a new picture for the event that will occur next.\n\nWhy is it useful?\n-  Provides predictability for the child’s day\n-  Can be reinforcing to complete an undesirable task\n-  Provides upcoming information without being overwhelming\n-  Breaks down a larger schedule"

      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

Teach your toddler what an airplane, truck, and train sound like in a way that they will love.\n\nEach tile you touch opens up and reveals an exciting picture that plays a sound. The images rotate so that children can learn to identify the object, not just the single image that is shown.\n\nParents and children alike love this app and you will too! Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

      "label": "Мы поможем вам!\n\nВсего за несколько минут в день вы научитесь составлять предложения на английском, незаметно для себя выучите много новых слов.\n\nИнтенсивный обучающий курс «Полиглот» состоит из 16 занятий. После его завершения любой человек легко сможет разговаривать на английском языке.\n\nСписок занятий:\n\n1.   Базовая форма глагола.\n2.   Местоимения. Вопросительные слова.\n3.   Глагол \"to be\". Предлоги места. Like/Want.\n4.   Притяжательные местоимения.\n5.   Профессии. Этикет.\n6.   Степени сравнения прилагательных. Указательные местоимения.\n7.   Слова-параметры. Употребление much и many.\n8.   Предлоги и параметры времени.\n9.   There is / There are.\n10. Предлоги направления и движения.\n11. Модальные глаголы can, must, should.\n12. Continuous \n13. Прилагательные. Описание людей. Погода\n14. Present Perfect\n15. Повелительное наклонение\n16. Фразовые глаголы\n\nКаждое занятие содержит подробное описание грамматики английского языка по данному уроку.\n \nКак это работает?\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам простые выражения на русском языке.\n\nИз слов на экране вам нужно составить английский перевод.\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ. Правильный ответ озвучивается.\n\nЧтобы перейти к следующему уроку необходимо набрать 4.5 балла в предыдущем уроке. Пока баллы не набраны, уроки остаются заблокированными.\n\nРезультаты синхронизируются через iCloud.\n\nКак рассчитываются баллы?\n\nПрограмма помнит 100 последних ответов, количество ПРАВИЛЬНЫХ ответов делит на 100 и умножает на 5.\nЧтобы набрать 4.5 балла надо ответить правильно на 90 вопросов из 100.\n\nСлишком просто?\n\nТогда включите в настройках повышенный уровень сложности. Программа не будет предлагать вам варианты слов, а попросит ввести предложение с клавиатуры.\n\nЭКЗАМЕН\n\nЭкзамен предназначен для закрепления знаний по пройденным урокам. Также он хорошо подходит, чтобы освежить знания.\n\nПо каждому выбранному уроку составляется 10 заданий. Все задания перемешиваются и предлагаются Вам для выполнения в случайном порядке.\n\nПрограмма запоминает результаты выполнения по каждому из уроков в экзамене. По завершении экзамена выставляется общая оценка и оценка по каждому уроку.\n\nНе надо расстраиваться, если с первого раза Вы не получили максимальную оценку.\n\nЭто просто напоминание, что нужно дополнительно потренироваться в соответствующем уроке. Ведь главная цель данного приложения помочь Вам в изучении английского языка, а не выставление оценки за экзамен.\n\nЕсли вы знаете как улучшить программу, напишите нам !\n\nМы ВКонтакте: http://vk.com/polyglotmobile"

Poke around a bit, explore the tree — you might find some surprises to expand your pet family!\n\nPET HOTEL: Sometimes families go on trips without their pets, but thanks to the pet hotel, pets get a vacation of their own! With lots of cozy spaces, an aquarium and outdoor space, every pet will find a nice spot to play or relax — dog or cat, bird or sloth-bat!\n\nVETERINARY: The vet can help sick pets feel better and help healthy pets stay that way! You’ll find pills, drops and the instruments needed to operate on sick or injured pets. Pets can play outdoors or wait on the cozy beds until the vet is ready to see them.\n\nPET SHOP: Find everything you need for to groom, feed, play with and care for your pets at the pet shop. After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video!

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7.

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

Отображается в правом верхнем углу. Означает количество баллов по текущему слову.\n• Процент изученности. Означает процент изученности слов в словаре.\n\nКАК НАЧИСЛЯЮТСЯ БАЛЛЫ\n\nЗа правильный ответ начисляется 1 балл, за неправильный - снимается 2 балла, при просмотре карточки балл не засчитывается.\n\nПервые три балла начисляются при изучении слова, их можно набрать сразу. После этого слово переходит на повтор и баллы по нему не начисляются пока не настанет время повтора.\n\nЧетвертый балл дается при повторе через 1 день.\nПятый балл дается при повторе  ещё через 3 дня.\n\nИтого, слово может стать выученным на пятый день, если вы набрали 5 баллов.\n\nКАК ЭТО РАБОТАЕТ.\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам на русском языке слово и предложение с этим словом. Вам необходимо ответить, как данное слово в текущем контексте должно быть переведено на английский язык.\n\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ и покажет карточку слова.\nВ любом случае вам будет показан английский вариант предложения.\n\nРазные формы слов учатся и учитываются в статистике независимо. Например, по словам I и me, see и saw подсчёт ведётся отдельно.\n\nКарточку слова можно посмотреть выбрав соответствующий пункт меню.\nПроцесс изучения слов начинается с того, что программа набирает из своего словаря 15 слов и начинает их показывать в случайном порядке.\n\nПосле того, как слово переходит в группу \"повторяемые\" из словаря извлекается следующее слово.\n\nПовтор производится через 1, 2 дня. Время, когда будет показан повтор всегда исчисляется от времени предыдущего ответа.\n\nЕсли вы отвечаете правильно на все повторы, то слово переходит в группу \"выученные\" и больше не будет предлагаться.\nЕсли вы посмотрели карточку, то баллы не начисляются.\n\nСЛОВАРЬ\nНа текущий момент словарь программы содержит около 1500 наиболее употребляемых английских слов, а также слов используемых в программе \"Полиглот\".\nНеправильные глаголы представлены в первой и второй формах. Подсчет баллов по каждой форме идет независимо. Слова в словаре расположены в порядке изучения.\n\nОЗВУЧКА\nДоступно произношение английского предложения."

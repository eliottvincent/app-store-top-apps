      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!\n\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English.

Otherwise flying will only be a dream once again.\n\nTiny Wings was chosen as the iPhone Game of the Year in App Store Rewind 2011 in Europe and many other countries. Thank you Apple and a big thank you to all Tiny Wings fans!\n\nHighlights: \n• simple \"one button\" (ok... maybe \"one tap\") arcade game about the dream of flying \n• the world is changing every day - so it does in this game! Procedural generated graphics will make \"tiny wings\" look different every day you play\n • Two game modes: \"Day Trip\" and \"Flight School\"\n• iPad only: Split screen multiplayer!\n• upgrade your nest by fulfilling tasks\n• Play as the mama bird or one of her four children\n• 30 hand-designed levels in the new \"Flight School\" mode\n• iCloud support (even syncs your game between the iPhone & iPad versions)"

      "label": "Mini Chess is a simplified, modern variant of the classic Chess. Played on a 5 x 5 board, with fewer pieces (one rook, knight and bishop and 5 pawns), each game can be played in minutes. Castling and pawn double-move are not allowed. Players have the option to face off against AI with 3 levels of difficulty.  The game combines the fun and convenience of other play-while-you-wait games with intellectual stimulation of real Chess and is also a great way to introduce kids to the basics of Chess.  This fast paced game is a perfect take on the timeless classic for our fast paced world."

Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dire future.\n\nAs the overwhelming despair of this new world surrounds you, how will you survive? Your approach to the countless moral choices you’ll be faced with on a daily basis, could be the difference between the lives of your family or their unfortunate end. Resources are scarce though, with barely enough to cling desperately to life for another day you’re already faced with a monumental choice. Who will you send to venture out into the vast unforgiving wasteland? Whilst exploration is a traumatic experience, the weapons you can craft from resources could tip the scales of life or death in your favour. Assaults from feral beasts and roaming factions are endlessly closing in, imminent and deadly risks surround you.\n ‘Violence is never the answer’… Maybe you once believed that, but combat may now be your only option for survival. As you and your family grow and progress, so do their skills, attributes and weaknesses. Ensure that they’re well equipped as you strategize, securing victory against those who threaten the survival of your family in tense turn based combat."

The stronger your non-American accent, the less accurate the recognition may work.\n\n====================\nTHANKS\n\nHuge thanks to the entire Infinite Flight community for their amazing support, as well as Laura & Infinite Flight for providing an awesome API that makes apps like this one possible.\n\nAdditional thanks to Cam (maker of LiveFlight) for his open-source API examples.\n\nThanks to Jan (www.helpathand.nl) for his audio engineering assistance!\n\n====================\nFINE PRINT\n\nIn-Flight Assistant is not affiliated with Infinite Flight."

      "label": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.

      "label": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

It is also very hard, and I love it for that.” ***\n84/100 – PC Gamer\n \n***”It evokes lot of the more demanding thrills that modern games have left behind, the grit and the hard won satisfaction of overcoming intimidating challenges, or the experimental fun of spending hours tinkering with all the different ways you can play through a big, open-ended level. I had a blast inching my way through pretty much all of the harder stages in this game and I also think you might have a blast with it too.” ***\nSuper Bunnyhop\n \n“It’s a thing of beauty and manages to capture the planning and satisfying execution of more complex strategy games, as well as the gung-ho and the popping-off of growly man in military shooters. (...) It’s probably the best man-shootery game I’ve played in years.”\nIndie Statik\n \nDoor Kickers mixes old school, no-quarter action with modern ergonomic interfaces and puts you in command of a SWAT team during a tactical intervention.\n \nAnalyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.\n \nIt may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps and losing no people, that’s a skill harder to master.\nQuick Points:\n§ 80 single missions, 6 campaigns and unlimited gameplay via mission generator\n§ Over 65 weapons and gear items to use and overcome the enemy.\n§ Top Down perspective  for optimal tactical analysis\n§ Real Time With Free Pause\n§ No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces\n§ Realistic but action packed\n§ Non-linear levels, freeform gameplay\n\nWebsite https://inthekillhouse.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/KillHouseGames\nTwitter - @inthekillhouse"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

      "label": "Featured in Watercolor Artist Magazine, Artists Magazine, LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\n\nDa Vinci Eye is the essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills."

Color scheme by Itten is typically used by artists, and RGB is designed for online use. For both of them you can apply one of the 10 color combinations \\ harmonies.\n\nAbility to extract colors from your image\nSelect the desired picture from your phone and application's algorithms will extract colors. Then  you can choose favorite colors and save the palette.\n\nGet matching colors to your custom color\nJust type in your color code and discover color harmonies with this particular color.\n\nUse color editing tool\nIt is very important to balance the quantitative ratio of color in order to make your palette look harmonious in practice. The application has a convenient function to quickly swap colors in the images. There are 3 pictures and gradient in the palette editing carousel. You can see how the selected colors look in different ratios. \n\nEasy to manage and share\nAlso you will be able to save, export and remove palettes. To share the desired palette just choose mode — text HEX codes or image. You can always copy a particular color code under color swatch to the clipboard.\n\nDeveloping Color Gear we tried to make it professional and easy to use.

      "label": "Yes, this app will help you draw like a pro!\n\nWhether you're drawing on paper with a pencil, or cookies with royal icing, Camera Lucida will help you become a better artist.\n\nBe sure to read the reviews and the functionality you get with Camera Lucida!  There are lots of competitors and we know Camera Lucida costs a bit more, but no other app comes anywhere close to matching the functionality you get with 12 years of software development and refinement!\n\nUnlike hundreds of apps that enable you to create digital art, Camera Lucida instead enables you to create amazing physical art!  Our app works by having your iPhone or iPad's camera pointed at your drawing surface.  By watching your screen as you draw, you will be able to to see your reference image superimposed with your drawing - guiding your hand as little or as much as you want while you create your art.  Better than a projector and more versatile than a light table, Camera Lucida has been fine-tuned for over a decade to provide artists with the features they need to be accurate and creative.\n\nFor over a century, artists have made use of the camera lucida optical device to superimpose a live view of their subject onto their drawing or painting surface.  Allowing the artist to trace what they see in front of them, the camera lucida is an invaluable aid in creating a lifelike and realistic drawing.  Truly a camera lucida for the 21st century!\n\nWith our Camera Lucida iPhone/iPad application, artists and non-artists alike can now draw anything they have a photo of.  When looking at your screen, you'll be able to simultaneously see the image you want to draw as well as your drawing surface as you create your work of art.  Camera Lucida isn’t a projector, instead the app shows you a virtual image and you draw by watching your paper and hand on the screen as you draw!  It’s really clever and cool!\n\nWith over 12 years of continuous development, Camera Lucida's functionality eclipses the competition.  Check out these features:\n   -  Advanced image filters to help you see with an artist's eye.\n   -  Multi-device support to enable you to stream live video of your drawing to a second device.  *Requires iOS 10.3 or higher to receive hosted video.  Also, newer devices are recommended due to the processing requirements.*\n   -  Support for saving and restoring sessions, including automatically realigning your camera, sketch and reference image.\n   -  Full color palette control, including using your own paints, markers, etc.\n   -  Use any camera on your device and adjust for tilted and mirrored setups manually, or use an in-app purchase do do it automatically.\n   -  Secondary video feed support to enable you to draw from a live subject, not just a photograph.   *Requires iOS 10.3 or higher to receive hosted video.*\n   -  Time-lapsed recordings of you creating your drawing you can share on social media.  \n   -  Support for external bluetooth keyboards to aid in creating large art through mirroring your display.\n   -  Advanced tools such as vertical split screen sliders, timed image fading in and out, etc.\n   -  A projector mode that can be used when you’re using the app with a projector.\n   -  Video tutorials you can watch from within the app or from YouTube.\n   -  A full user manual available from within the app.\n   -  Continued support for iOS all the way back to 9.3 with only minor restrictions on functionality.\n   -  Customer support that you can count on and an active user community for inspiration.\n\nTo use our application, you just place your iPhone or iPad between your drawing surface and your eyes and trace what you see on the screen!\n\nIMPORTANT:  To use Camera Lucida, you need to fix your iPhone or iPad in place above your drawing.  We use a stack of books or a flower vase to do this.  Tutorials are included in the app to help you get started.  Also, some advanced functions such as receiving the multi-device video feed require iOS 10.3 or higher.\n\nContact: lucidaPete@gmail.com"

We have made it easy and fast to 3D scan real objects, modify them in-app, export the result into many 3D file formats, platforms and 3D printers and even magically bring them to life with animations. A perfect tool for AR/VR (Augmented Reality) content creation, 3D Printing, STEM Education, eCommerce showcase and many other uses.\n\nSCANNING\nScanning real objects has never been easier. Print the included AR mat, place your object in the middle of the mat and let the Augmented Reality dome guide you through the scanning process. Scan the object from two different angles and it will be auto merged for better and more complete 3D results.\n\nWith Qlone, there is no waiting time, all processing is done live on your phone in seconds.\n\nPrint the mat directly from the app with AirPrint or send it as a mail and print out.\n\nMODIFYING\nWith the integrated tools in the app so you can optimize and modify your 3D model without needing to export them.\n\nTexture - Change the Brightness, Saturation and Sharpness of the 3D model. Pick colors from the scanned object and apply them by painting directly on the 3D model. Blur areas or transitions for smoother results.\nClean - Improve the quality of the model by erasing unwanted areas or smoothing the surface. \nSculpt - Improve or alter the shape of your object by pressing or pulling a selected area and adjust the transition.\nShape - Enhance the mesh details or set the scale size of your model for 3D printing, simplify the mesh for lower file size export.\nArt - Turn your object into scaled cubes or meshed objects of art, ready to be printed.\n\nAR View + Animation:\nYou can beam your 3D models back to reality and bring them to life with automatic rigging and animation.\n\nEXPORTING and IMPORTING:\nExport your model directly to platforms like SketchFab, i.materialise, Lens Studio, Shapeways and CGTrader. Models can be exported in a variety of formats for use in other 3D tools – OBJ, STL, FBX, USDZ, GLB (Binary glTF) which includes animation, PLY, X3D. \n\nShare your models with friends as an image, video or GIF through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Email and iMessage.\n\nYou can import any 3D model into Qlone. Import in any 3D format (40+ formats) to view, modify or bring it to life in AR with our automatic animation!\n\nPRIVACY POLICY:\nhttp://eyecue-tech.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=143\n\nTERMS OF USE:\nhttp://eyecue-tech.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=142"

      "label": "* A quick sketch of Galadriel (played by Cate Blanchett) from \"The Lord Of The Rings\" film series; done using Vermeer's Lens, a 2B pencil and blue ballpoint pen on an A4 printer paper. \n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens is no ordinary drawing app. It is a drawing app that helps you make real sketches on paper.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens is an augmented reality drawing app that works like an AR projector. It projects any photo you've selected from your photo library on any paper or sketch books you prefer drawing on. \n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens allows you to trace out the images you want to draw before shading. But it is more than a tracing tool, as it also allows you to capture areas of different tones and highlights - achieving a more lifelike picture. \n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens is a great tool for portrait drawing.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens can also be used in short drawing/sketching practices for beginners.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens enables even beginners to make stunning drawings. \n\n◉ Through its precise algorithms, what is traditionally difficult, such as portraits, can now be done without the need of construction lines.   \n\n◉ This app works on most phones without using Apple's ARKit which can only run on newer high performance chips. It's a simple effective tool for a simple hobby.\n\n*** See \"Developer's website\" below for a video demo\n\n*** A Youtube channel (see \"Developer's website\") is set up to provide you with examples of Vermeer's Lens in action. Content will be regularly uploaded so long as there are people interested in this app.\n\n*** This app works on most phones without using Apple's ARKit which can only run on newer high performance chips. It is simple, reliable and stable.\n________________________________________________________\nHow it works :\n\n> a photo is chosen from your photo library and  “projected” over the paper to draw on.\n\n> This projection is achieved by imaging the paper on the phone screen, and overlaying the translucent photo onto it.\n\n> With the phone held in a phone-holder, you can use its screen as a lens, through which you trace out the photo onto the paper.\n\n> Phone can be tilted and rotated to the angle most comfortable to you, while Vermeer’s Lens transforms the photo to match the perspective of the paper.\n\n> Not just the outlines, even the different subtle tones and contours of a face could be captured, to get that 3-D effect.\n\n> Opacity of the overlaying photo could be adjusted to allow close comparison between your drawing and the photo.\n\n> The overlaying photo responds to on-screen gesture: you could move, scale and rotate the photo during sketching.\n\n> A zoom option allows you to zoom in on your drawing for delicate pencil work.\n\nin addition :\n\n> A Vermeer’s Lens channel is also created on youtube to provide our users with additional \"instructions & tutorials\"on the use of this app to create art (videos updated regularly).\n\nThis is linked directly to the app via the  “Demo” button.\n\n> You can email us for support/feedback directly via the “Contact Us” button on the main menu of the app. Or leave a message (go to the “about” tab) on our youtube channel    (see “Developer’s website” below).\n\nFor more info and demo:\n\n> See “Developer’s website” below"

      "label": "ArtRage Vitae is our Premium Natural Painting application for mobile devices!\r\n\r\nGet creative on your digital canvas with realistic color blending, mixing oil paint, delicate watercolor, and much more! Ever wanted to try painting your masterpiece but were put off by the mess and expense? Now you can!\r\n\r\nArtRage Vitae isn't just about color: It knows how much paint you've used so you can mix it and spread it on a textured canvas. It knows how wet your paint is so you can blend it with other paints. It even knows about the roughness of your paper so your pencils can be used for soft shading.\r\n\r\nIt's not just a special effect either - ArtRage Vitae is a live simulation of the properties of real artistic media that lets you get creative with colors and textures using tools you already know how to use!\r\n\r\nArtRage Vitae takes full advantage of the Apple Pencil support for pressure & tilt, and 3D touch on your iPhone when available.\r\n\r\nJoin the ArtRage community:\r\nForums: forums.artrage.com\r\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/artrage\r\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/artrage_paint/\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nReal world painting tools: Oils, Watercolors, Paint Rollers, Pencils, Crayons and more. Each tool has a range of familiar properties such as how much thinner is applied to the paint, or how soft a pencil tip is. Tools apply texture as well as color, and blend under the brush.\r\n\r\nAdd Layers to your painting and work on individual elements without damaging others. ArtRage supports a wide range of layer effects, layer blend modes, and layer contents can be scaled moved and rotated independently.\r\n\r\nImport images, converting them to oil paint for mixing and blending or as Reference Images pinned to the canvas as a visual guide. Load photos as Tracing Images which are overlaid on the canvas, and have ArtRage select colors automatically as you paint.\r\n\r\nThe interface has been designed to maximize your creative space without hiding away critical functions such as tool and color selection. As you paint, it gets out of the way so that you don’t have to stop and manually adjust panels.\r\n\r\nRecord your paintings! The ArtRage Script system lets you record strokes while you paint for playback in desktop versions of the product at higher resolution.\r\n\r\nShare your paintings on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Creative Cloud, Dropbox, DeviantArt or any other sharing app on your device.\r\n\r\nTools:\r\n\r\n• Oil Brush, Watercolor, Airbrush, Palette Knife, Paint Roller, Paint Tube, Inking Pen, Pencil, Marker Pen, Chalk, Crayon, Glitter Tube, Gloop Pen, Eraser, Flood Fill, Cloner.\r\n\r\n• Paint simulation monitors the physical properties of your paints to allow natural blending, smearing, and other real world behavior.\r\n\r\n• Preset support to save your favorite settings for later use.\r\n\r\n• Supports the Apple Pencil's Pressure and Tilt properties, and 3D Touch where available to add realism to the simulated paint strokes.\r\n\r\nLayers:\r\n\r\n• Unlimited layers with Photoshop standard blend modes, visibility and opacity controls. Scale, rotate, and position layer contents independently.\r\n\r\nUtilities:\r\n\r\n• Record your paintings as Scripts then play them back in a desktop version of ArtRage.\r\n\r\n• Unlimited Undo / Redo. Load photos as References or Tracing images.\r\n\r\n\r\nFiles:\r\n\r\n• 4096 x 4096 Canvas now available on all devices.\r\n\r\n• Control the texture and color of the canvas to create different effects. Canvas presets can be stored for later.\r\n\r\n• Export PTG, JPG or PNG to services such as Email, Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox, and more. Share images on Facebook or Twitter. Import photos to a new file or a layer, with camera support.\r\n\r\nInterface:\r\n\r\n• Easy access pods provide functionality without getting in the way. Elements vanish as you paint so you can paint underneath. Multi-Touch shortcuts for canvas manipulation, Undo/Redo, and Brush Size.\r\n\r\nStylus & Input Support:\r\n\r\n• Apple Pencil Pressure & Tilt.\r\n• Supports 3D Touch.\r\n• Includes support for Wacom, Adonit and Pogo styluses."

      "label": "Book art turns hardcover books into bold and sophisticated art pieces. Sometimes called 'Book Origami', book folding can be a surprisingly easy and peaceful form of meditation. Following simple patterns, anyone can create beautiful and unique gifts for loved ones that work fabulously as home decor. The actual book folding patterns were once difficult to find - until now! Simply add your images, shapes, and loved ones' names into the Book Art Pattern Maker, and generate a pattern in seconds. All of your patterns are stored conveniently in your iPhone's Documents folder for easy access. With the iOS Book Art app, it's easier than ever to create Measure, Mark, Fold patterns, Cut & Fold patterns, and Shadow Fold patterns.\n\nJust tap 'Create document' and enter a few details about the book you would like to fold. For beginners, Measure, Mark, Fold patterns work best with solid images and shapes that aren't overly detailed; hearts and names are perfect! Advanced Book Artists will be eager to try the new Cut & Fold option. Check the preview to make sure the pattern was generated appropriately; if necessary, try adding or removing white spaces around your shape to adjust the aspect ratio. Then follow the instructions: measure the distance from the top of the page and mark the respective 'start mark' and 'end mark.' You may use inches or centimeters, just stay consistent with whichever unit you used to generate the pattern. Then at each mark, make your creases and fold the corners of the page inward. Then - that's it! Keep folding until you reach the end of the pattern. One of the most enjoyable feelings is watching the pattern take shape, page by page.\n\nSoon enough you'll have wonderful, thoughtful, and unique gifts about which people can't help but remark. Let's get folding!\n\nTerms of Use can be found here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "“Before the needle even hits the skin, there is the crucial step that sets the tone for the entire tattoo - applying the stencil.  Stencilling tattoos on the body is an art unto itself.  Great tattoos start with great stencils, and great stencils start with the ideal image.  The better you can see what you’re doing, the more accurate your linework is gonna be.  Over 20 years of tattooing mostly geometric tattoos has forced me to intensely analyze the art of stencilling and push it to its limits, and through this app I’ve been able to push them even farther.  Increasing efficiency and accuracy in my work has always been a passion of mine, and I can’t wait to share this with my fellow tattooers” \n-Cory Ferguson\n\nThe easy to use Tattoo Print System gives you tools to customize and enhance your images right before you print them out so they’re ready to go straight into the stencil machine and result in the best stencils possible.  No matter what style you tattoo in, this app will save you time and level up your stencil game.   Giving you the ability to dial in your finished designs to your liking so when they come out of the stencil machine they are more precise and personalized to how you like to work.  \n\nThese are tools that every single tattoo artist has always needed!\n\nOnce installed you can access Tattoo Print System from any app on your iPad or iPhone that has the share button as an option (you know- that icon that looks like a little box containing an arrow pointing up)\n\nSo how does Tattoo Print System save you time and make your stencils better? \n\n-Print out large scale tattoos at actual size!  Measure out the size your tattoo will be on the body and enter those measurements into Tattoo Print System and let the app do the rest.  It automatically breaks the design into as many sheets of paper as needed and prints them out ready to go straight into the stencil machine.  No more resizing on a photocopier!  \n\n-Multi-page stencils need to be taped together as any experienced tattooer will know.  We’ve included tools to help with this task too.  Optional guidelines and image overlaps make it quicker and easier to line up the image when taping stencil pages together.    \n\n-Convert any image into just outlines with a single click \nWe’re tattooers - we all love showing off that crispy linework.  Enhancing your designs with the convert to lines feature eliminates excess ink from your stencils making them cleaner, easier to see and ultimately more precise.  And you don’t have to spend time tracing the outline yourself, the app does it for you.  You can also fine tune those outlines to be thicker or thinner depending on your preference.  \n\n-Convert realistic and shaded images into halftone dots or crosshatching for stencils that have shading in them.  \n\n-Fine tune the contrast, shadows and highlights of your designs to take a “not so great” reference picture and turn it into the sort of design that makes for a perfect stencil.  Often times a picture of the reference that you take on your phone can be enhanced with our adjustment sliders into a truly stencil worthy image.   \n\n-Add an optional, customizable grid to your stencil as a visual reference to help see if your image is level on the body.  This is especially useful for doing symmetrical pieces across the width of the torso, ie full chest piece, back piece.   \n\n-The ability to stretch out a design if necessary, by adjusting the width and height separately. \n\n-Customizable grid images to print out and stencil to help with freehand drawing onto the skin.  Choose from square, isometric and polar grid.  \n\nThis printing system is already a part of our other app Geometrica - the first ever drawing app created for tattooers.  So if you’re a Geometrica subscriber you don’t need Tattoo Print System, you already have it.  But it was so ground breaking we had to also release it as it’s own app, because this is something that all tattooers need, not just the geometric artists."

But not all of us find drafting sleeve caps or armhole shaping to be as interesting; this is where the Handknit Garment Design App comes in. It does the work of designing the slope and shape of the sleeve cap, shoulders, armholes, necklines and even waist shaping, right down to the stitch. You, the designer, will still develop your overall garment design, but having these sometimes more tedious details taken care of for you will make the overall process more enjoyable and build your confidence in a successful outcome.\n\nBegin by developing your overall garment plan and work your swatches as described in Knitwear Design Workshop. Sketch out your working schematic, select your desired sweater silhouette, enter your measurements and required ease, and the app will generate stitch-by-stitch charts called stitch maps that you can use to write your pattern."

      "label": "TexCad is the tiniest app to design imaginative woven fabrics in minutes on your iPhone and iPad. Quickly create a woven fabric design using the ready library of Colours and Weaves. Unlock your design imagination with the powerful Auto-Design feature.\n\nLook before you Loom !!\n==================\nQuickly create a collection of beautiful woven fabric designs using simple weaves and colors. The app contains a pre-fed library of the commonly used weaves and colors. Also included is a set of default designs that help you get hands on while discovering the power of this app. \n\nTexCad with its ergonomic and user-friendly interface makes creativity a very enjoyable and addictive experience. The app is designed to be friendly to the designer, merchandiser, weaver and student alike. Knowledge of yarn parameters like counts and blends are not required.\n\nAuto-Design\n==========\nPlay on any given design using the power of Auto-design to create amazing new patterns and color-ways. The Auto feature gives you the option to create random warp and/or weft patterns. With the Auto Color option you can create amazing new color-ways from a given design. \n\nUsers will love this feature and enjoy creating stunning new designs in seconds by the touch of a button !!\n\nFabric size\n========\nFabric images are viewed in the required finished ends per inch( or cm) and picks per inch(or cm). The fabric images are realistic and in near actual size, based on the entered ends/inch (or cm) and picks/inch (or cm). \n\nDesign Communication\n==================\nCommunicate your design ideas to other TexCad users or to fabric and garment manufacturers, merchandisers or traders. \n\nSend and receive designs and their images to and from other TexCad users via email. The design file can be opened from within the email message and saved to your library.  All the design data on a device can be backed up to a desktop using  iTunes.\n\nFabric Effects\n===========\nVariety of fabrics like yarn dyed stripes and checks with different structure effects can be displayed accurately. \n\nEffects like  Melange, Indigo, Silk, Denim, and many Natural Spun effects are closely represented.\n \nRealistic weave effects are displayed in fabrics even when the same yarns are used in the warp and weft. \n\nThe 'Spun' slider brings to life the displayed fabric, simulating effects of the yarn's natural unevenness.\n\nPattern  Editor\n===========\nThe Warp and Weft pattern is input using a text format. A pattern like 4A4B would represent 4 threads (ends or picks) of Color A followed by 4 threads of Color B, and so on. 8 colors are available in each the Warp and Weft respectively. A pattern can be a maximum of 1200 Ends and/or 1200 Picks;\n\nReady Library Of Weaves And Colors\n============================\nThe app contains a weave library of the most used standard weaves.

      "label": "\"The perfect -one of a kind- app organizer!\"\n\nMister Icon helps you keep a neat and tidy home screen by providing a range of decorative text labels and matching wallpapers.\n\nCreate beautiful, practical, aesthetic home screens.\n\nNo ads, in-app purchases or subscriptions!\nJust a simple, one-off payment.\n\n\n-- USER REVIEWS --\n\n\"This is THE app to easily and neatly organize your screen.\"\n\"I've been looking for something like this for years.\"\n\n\n-- THE BASICS --\n\nIf you have a lot of apps, it can often be difficult to find the one you are looking for, but Mister Icon's text-based label icons can help bring some order to your iPhone or iPad.\n\nMister Icon does not provide any means of making 'folders', and does not do all the hard work for you.\n\nMister Icon simply provides a range of pre-prepared text icon labels that you can add to your home screen and display next to your apps. It's then up to you to move the icons around until you're happy.\n\nFor example, install a 'Games' icon to your home screen, then move all your favorite games nearby so that it's easier to find them the next time you swipe past.\n\nThe icons are easy to install and there is no need to use the Shortcuts app, unless you want to make the icons perform special actions when you tap on them. The Tips & Tricks section in Mister Icon includes detailed instructions on both installation methods, so you can choose whichever suits your needs best.\n\n\n-- THE ICONS --\n\nThere are more than 150 icon labels to choose from, and each icon is available in 20 different styles, including several 'round' options.\n\nUse any of the 36 built-in color schemes, or create your own custom color schemes, then apply them to both icons and wallpapers.\n\nMister Icon allows you to easily label the different screens on your iOS device, so you can effectively create a 'kids' page, a 'work' page, a 'news' page, or simply number each of your home screens from 1 to 15.\n\nThe icons can be reorganized the same way as normal apps - simply tap and hold on any icon until it starts wobbling, then drag it into the desired location.  Be creative and use Mister Icon's icons in whatever way works best for you!\n\n\n-- THE WALLPAPERS --\n\nThe included wallpapers are simple in design, but highly functional, and can be easily matched to your icon colors.  Different wallpapers have been designed for each iOS/iPadOS device model, from the smallest iPhone SE right through to the largest iPad Pro.\n\nSome wallpapers allow for a 'seamless' effect when used with icons of the same color. Similarly, a circular label effect can be achieved through use of the app's 'round' icon sets and matching wallpaper backgrounds.\n\nSpecial 'hidden notch' and 'hidden island' wallpapers are available on relevant devices to allow you to blend in the 'notch' or 'island' at the top of your home screen, if you want to.\n\n\n-- THE DETAILS --\n\nPlease visit mistericon.com for more information, along with some sample icon arrangements that might provide useful inspiration for organizing your own home screens.  If you're unsure about what this app does, please be sure to take a thorough look through my website before purchasing.  If you're lazy or just don't care about neatness, then my app is probably not for you.\n\nIf you don't speak English then my app is probably not for you either, as the icon labels are in English only (aside from some Arabic numerals).\n\nMister Icon contains NO ads, NO in-app purchases and NO subscriptions.  Buy once and access all of the icons, plus the matching wallpapers, including any added to the app in the future.\n\nI hope you will find my app to be a useful and fun way to help tidy up your home screen.\n\n-- Mister Icon --"

Facebook.com/qixelgallery\n\nHere's what you can do with Qixel HD: \n\n- Draw pictures with 4 different pixel types: Squares, Circles, Diamonds and Triangles. \n\n- The canvas background button flips between black or white. This has a very different effect on your qixels. \n\n- Use the darken and lighten buttons to add shade and depth to your art. \n\n- The triangle setting has an extra button: Rotation. Try rotating your triangles 90 degrees to make strange patterns and origami-style art. \n\n- Use Qixel to make quirky typography. \n\n- Write simple messages and greeting cards to send to friends. \n\n- Make cool patterns and abstract backgrounds for websites. \n\n- Create retro game graphics, and then export frames in stages to make animation. \n\n- experiment with colour: great for artists and colour therapy teachers. \n\nALLOW The PHOTO PERMISSION\n\n- Qixel HD will ask you to permission to access your photos. Clicking 'OK' will allow you to save high res PNG files to your device's Camera Roll. \n\n- The Photo button saves a high-res PNG screenshot to your iPad's camera roll. \n\nMake sure you allow the Photo permission in your iOS device's restrictions.\n\nGo to Settings > General > Restrictions > Privacy > Photos > Switch Qixel HD on.\n\niOS 12:  Settings > Screen Time > Content and Privacy Restrictions > Photos > Switch Qixel HD on.\n\n\nhese aren't just Pixels... these are Qixels!"

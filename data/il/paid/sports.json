By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "Sailing on the go – Tactical Sailing Tips\nWhether a rookie or a professional sailor, everyone interested in the sport of sailing can find a selection of the most important tips needed to steer your boat the \"Right of Way\", to take the wind from the best side and to also make use of tactical maneuvers while racing against other opponents. \n\nThe main purpose of this app is to visualize the paths sailed in 16 tips overall as animated video clips for following advanced racing tactical situations: \n- speed of boats,\n- position of sails, as well as direction and strength of wind,\n- for tactical maneuvers against the wind,\n- basic Right of Way Rules (ISAF / World Sailing).\nAll animations are presented as video clips, comments can be printed out (pdf) as an extension to the tips and their simulated scenes, which you should watch on your iPhone or iPad. After downloading you can use the tips without internet access to take with you on your yacht. \n\nIn 2012 these tips were awarded winner of the \"European Award for Technology Supported Learning - Best Media Didactics!“ \niPhone and iPad: This App, however, is only the first step into the world of sailing. Designed for iPad, it will also display on iPhone, but of course in smaller sizes of videos. The first three tips are with sound, the others are without sound, it is  because of memory allocation restrictions (150 MB). Therefore the text is a useful extension for iPhone because of its small font size, print and read the comments in a .pdf file. The video clips are sized to be presented on Apple TV.\nThese tips - and further 40 tips - are part of a game: \"Tactical Sailing - A Game Against the Wind\" and “Boat Against Boat” and \"Coach´s Toolbox\".  If you want to have fun with a powerful Tactic and Strategy game,  see a demo for free and order it on our website: www.Tacticalsailing.com - runs on Mac and PC.

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available).

      "label": "OVERVIEW\n\nHarry's Sailor is a GPS based navigation tool / sailing companion. Like all apps from Harry's GPS Suite it uses an advanced GPS Engine developed and maintained for a decade. For this Sailor app, the engine was expanded for the specific situation on a ship. One example for this expansion is treatment of speed. GPS is weak delivering exact speed informations at low vessel speeds making it necessary to utilize special algorithms.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThis version brings a number of unique features to the iPhone platform. Examples are: visualization and measurement of heeling including a visual alarm when heeling in larger that 20 / 25 degree; display of racing rule #10: when boats are on opposite tacks, a port-tack boat shall keep clear of a starboard-tack boat; full navigation support, course can be defined using polar coordinates, defined waypoints, or using a course given; full integration of Google Maps; while navigation is started, deviation from course, distance to waypoint, and velocity made good (VMG) is displayed continuously; extensive reference on nautic information: signal flags, morse code, buoyages, lights and shapes, wind speed; finally, a full trip recorder including statistics, ports visited, and Google Earth export. \n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nSailor requires an iOS device featuring GPS. In case you want to use an iPod touch, an external GPS mouse needs to be added. Compatible devices are listed on www.gps-laptimer.de/compatibility/ios."

      "label": "Dive Plan is a digital decompression table and log book, made using general public information, most compatible with PADI, SSI, SDI, NAUI, NAVI diving tables, and it is comparable with most of the other current diving organizations and their dive tables. Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

      "label": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year. There is a 2 weeks free trial period.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to SprintTimer Pro, the purchase will be charged to your Apple ID account. The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the period. You can manage it from the user settings in iTunes after purchasing it, and you will also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there.\n\nIf you purchase a new SprintTimer Pro subscription during a free trial you will forfeit any free trial remaining from your first subscription.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy: https://sprinttimer.se/privacy\n\n\nIcon runners made by Freepik from Flaticon.com"

      "label": "This nice little tool - a must have for every paraglider pilot - emulates a variometer on your iPhone. \n\nSince version 3.0 the app supports iOS9, as well as the pressure sensor of your iPhone 6(s) or iPhone  6(s) Plus. \n\nTherefore your iPhone is a complete replacement for a \"real\" variometer. \n\nIn conjunction with an external sensor such as ASI FlyNet2, FlyTec SenseBox or the XC-TRacer, the app provides even more precise climb- and sink-rates. \n\nYou can use it to measure\n\n    - climb/decline rate\n    - absolute altitude\n    - hight over ground\n    - relative height\n    - speed over ground and\n    - course\n\nValues ​​displayed in meters or feet/kn.\n\nThe current climb- or sink-rate is signaled via different \"beep\" sounds, as usual for a variometer. \n\nYou can watch your flight using the integrated map view in real time, so you will never loose your orientation. Even if your are flying accidentally within a cloud or under poor visibility conditions!\n\nBy typing to „Alt 3“ - usually after the adjusting phase - or any time later you can reset „Alt 3“ to „0“.\n\nMoreover you can use the App to\n\n    - record you flights \n    - view your recorded flights in the integrated map view  \n    - send your recorded flights by mail as kml-files or gpx -files to your friends \n    \nOne last note: \nThe app reacts a little somewhat slower, as e.g. a Bräuninger- or Flytec Vario, if you use the internal pressure sensor of the iPhone, because the sensor doesn't provide data as often as an external sensor. \n\nThe app requires a good GPS signal, if no internal or external pressure sensor can be used. \n\nPlease make sure in any case, that you have a good GPS signal,  if you use the app. \nThe app does NOT work - completely and reliably - in buildings or other situations in which you have no or a bad GPS signal! \nHowever, this should not be a problem, since you usually flying under a clear open sky. ;-) \n\nUsage - without - an internal or external sensor is possible, but subject to known the limitations of a pure GPS operation, such as using only open-air, a good GPS signal and altitude changes > 5m with at least 1-2 m/s. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\nEven if the App is running in background, the GPS location service is used by the App, if you record your flight!"

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle type and clip position, pilot jet and air screw position are shown (screw position is expressed in turns from fully tightened). These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration introduced in the next tabs. Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. The air density and density altitude are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine (you know that each engine has its own personality). \n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the model year, model and carburetor, and the oil mix ratio that you\\'re using.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures.\n\nValid for the following models from 2005 to 2021:\n- 50 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 50 SX Factory Edition: 2021.\n- 50 SX Mini: 2017-2021.\n- 65 SX: 2017-2021.\n- 85 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 105 SX: 2006-2012.\n- 125 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 125 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 125 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 125 XC: 2017-2018.\n- 144 SX: 2007-2008.\n- 150 SX: 2009-2021.\n- 150 XC: 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019.\n- 200 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 200 XC: 2005-2012.\n- 250 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 250 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 250 XC: 2007-2019.\n- 250 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 XC: 2009-2018.\n- 300 MXC: 2005.\n* Please note that the application is valid only for engines that use carburetor.

      "label": "Designed by sports scientists and coaches. Scientifically validated (publication in review in a high-impact journal). \nThe only app that accurately calculates the complete power-force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino et al.´s method (published in 2015). \n\nMy Sprint is the first app scientifically developed to measure the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes. Innovative design, validated by sports scientists, My Sprint is as reliable as a 4000$ radar plus PC system. Scientifically approved!\n\nSprint running, power output and forward acceleration are a key combination of performance in many sports activities. Determining individual Force–Velocity profile, maximal power and mechanical effectiveness during sprint propulsion is of great interest for coaches, sport practitioners, or physiotherapists. What makes you fast?\n\nTheir opinion about My Sprint:\n\n- Dr. Samozino: “One of our main interests is to make accessible to sport practitioners the scientific evaluations we do in our labs with very specific devices. The simple method on which My Sprint is based was developed in this sense to test the sprint mechanical capabilities in field condition. The results of the validation of the method in comparison to force plate measurements were better than those we expected! And the validity of the data obtained with My Sprint is in the same extent… but with an impressive simplicity!”  \n\n- Pr. Morin: “When we developed our 2015 simple method, we found it was a great achievement to measure sprint acceleration mechanics with a very high concurrent validity compared to the gold standard force plate measurements. My Sprint takes things to another level, since it allows accurate measurements with just an iPhone!”\n\nMy Sprint calculates Power-Force-Velocity profile and measures the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. It was specially designed to take advantage of the extraordinary 120-240fps camera of the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. You just need to perform an all-out 40 m sprint and mark the track with a reference system marks located at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 meters and you only need six visible vertical markers (like thin poles) at these markers to record the time between markers. After that My Sprint does the computations and calculates athlete´s mechanical capabilities.  \n\nFEATURES: \n\n- Accurate measurement of the split times over a sprint acceleration. Scientifically validated!\n- Calculation the Power-Force-Velocity profile using the innovative Samozino et al.´s method. You can therefore know the athlete’s mechanical capabilities that determine the entire sprint acceleration performance. These properties are integrative and encompass all the mechanisms involved in the total external force produced during each lower limb extension and the ability to orient it effectively onto the ground. \n- Record amazing slow motion videos up to 240fps (iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s) and analyse in a frame-by-frame mode as well as import videos from your camera roll. \n- Multi-user. You can create as many users as your need with My Sprint. You can assign each user to a team for a higher ease of use. \n- Performance follow-up. You can record as many sprints as you want for each user created and analyze performance through a competitive season. \n\nNote: My Sprint was scientifically validated using an iPhone 6, and it uses the slow motion video recording on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. On other devices, the measurements are less accurate slow motion video recording feature is not available. \n\nA SPRINT ACCELERATION MECHANICS LAB IN YOUR POCKET!"

      "label": "Blackjack Card Counter is a unique application for the iPhone and iPad.  Beware of imitations this is the original.\n\nIt allows any blackjack player, professional or amateur to keep track of their card count.\n\n** True Count **\n\nBlackjack Card Counter calculates the \"True Count\" for you and does it more accurately than manual methods.  As buttons are pressed in the app the total counted cards are recorded.  This is then adjusted to take into account cards that aren't recorded.  A “total cards dealt” number is determined which is then divided by 52 to represent total decks dealt.  This number is then used in the \"True Count\" calculation.\n\nYou can adjust the number of decks in the shoe by going to the info screen.\n\n** Card Counting Methods **\n\nFor each strategy press the button that contains the face value of the cards as they are drawn from the deck.  Depending on the strategy and on the value of the card the button will either add or subtract 1 or 2 from the \"Running Count\".\n\nHi-Lo  - Low cards 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (add 1 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q, K and A (subtract 1 from total).\n\nHi-Op  I - Low cards 3, 4, 5, and 6 (add 1 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 1 from total).\n\nHi-Op  II - Low cards 2, 3, 6 and 7 (add 1 to total) 4 and 5 (add 2 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 2 from total).\n\nOmega II - Low cards 2 and 3 (add 1 to total) 4, 5 and 6 (add 2 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 2 from total).\n\nAfter a shuffle the new deck button should be pressed to set the tally back to 0.\n\n** Basic Strategy **\n\nAs most blackjack players know if you stick to the Basic Strategy for blackjack the house has a small advantage.  But if you can keep count of the number of High and Low ranked cards in the pack you can gain a small advantage.  You do this by betting more when there are more High cards still in the deck.  \n\nYou have an advantage when more high cards are in the deck particularly near the end of the shoe.\n\nThis small advantage, around 1%, over a long period of time can result in huge wins.\n\nDisclaimer: This app is intended for home use entertainment purposes only. At many casinos it is deemed illegal to use an electronic device with the intention of gaining an advantage over the casino. By choosing accept you agree not to use this app for illegal purposes.  The developers of this app can not be held responsible for any misuse of this application.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWebtopia is the trading name for Poulet Maison Pty Ltd"

      "label": "****Designed by sport scientists, trusted by elite athletes****\n****Validated in the prestigious Journal of Sports Sciences****\n\nWhat is your maximal strength? Which weight should you use in your next training session to optimize results? My Lift is the first scientifically designed app to measure your 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM) in the most accurate way possible. \n\nKnowing your 1-RM in every single training session is essential to adjust your training intensity and get the best adaptations. However, performing an actual 1-RM test could be dangerous and fatiguing and, if performed every day, it will most likely lead to overtraining or injuries. \n\nTo solve this problem, My Lift uses scientifically validated algorithms that can estimate your 1-RM with high precision by simply recording your exercise. To do this, My Lift uses the high-speed video recording available on most iPhone and iPad devices to measure the velocity at which you are performing the exercise, which is highly correlated with your maximal strength capabilities. This novel approach is used by sport scientists and top-level coaches thanks to advanced instrumental like linear transducers or force platforms, but now you can measure your 1-RM like a pro just with your iPhone or iPad!\n\nMy Lift is very intuitive and easy to use: you just need to record one repetition of the desired exercise with 1 to 4 different submaximal loads and select its start and beginning in the app with its accurate frame-by-frame navigation. After that, My Lift will show you your 1-RM! \n\nLet's say you got a workout which includes 4x5 repetitions at your 80%1-RM. Well, you just need to pick a load and record one repetition with My Lift. It will tell if that load really corresponds to your 80% or not, so you can increase or decrease the weight to train in the right zone!\n\nMy Lift has a lot of great features that will help you measure your 1-RM in a very simple, yet powerful way:\n\n-Estimates your 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM) in a very simple way by measuring your movement velocity, a novel approach used by top sport scientists and elite coaches\n-Measures what %1-RM corresponds to a specific load so you can adjust your training and get the best results\n-Calculate your movement velocity to monitor your performance!\n-Analysis of velocity loss to monitor fatigue.\n-Track the trajectory of your lift and measure instantaneous position and velocity\n-Works with some of the most widely-used upper and lower body exercises by default: bench-press, deadlift, pull-up, military press, back squat & hip thrust. You can even create your own exercises!\n-Multi-team and multi-user: create as many teams and users as you want\n-Progress analysis: save as many tests as you want and see your progress through time to check if you have improved or worsened your performance. You can even see the percent of change from one test to another!\n-Data export: export your whole database to a csv file and play with your data in Excel!\n-iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n-Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n\nMy Lift, train smarter and get the best results!"

Accelerate through the entire engine rev range => On a flat, straight and horizontal road, perform an acceleration from low rev to the maximum rev, keeping the same gear : that's it!\n\nIMPORTANT : dyno test is not compatible with automatic gearboxes that doesn't have a manual mode.\n\nWith such a tool, you can check the efficiency of your various tunings, ECU mapping, chiptuning, and even your chassis settings.\n\nUsing the specification of the tested car and your device’s accelerometer, the application runs our algorithms and dynamic power loss calculations to provide the performances of your car with high accuracy.\n\nSkeptical? Here is a selection of comparison tests between “PerfExpert - Car Onboard Dyno” and real chassis dynos, performed by some of our users : http://bit.ly/perfexpert_vs_chassis_dyno\n\nFor further information, you can find our FAQ at https://www.perfexpert-app.com/faq\n\nHere are sample dyno and timed run reports created using the application :\nhttps://network.perfexpert-app.com/results/featured\n\nJoin now the growing PerfExpert community:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PerfExpert\n- Support : https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfexpert/\n\nFeatures:\n- Dyno test : measure the power and torque of your engine with advanced loss calculation model. Detection of the engine rev limiter. Detailed reports featuring interactive charts of wheel and engine horsepower and torque / engine speed, just like a regular chassis dynamometer.\n\n- Compute corrected power and torque using the correction norm of your choice (atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature and air humidity are taken into account). Available standards: DIN (Europe), SAE (America), JIS (Japan), CEE (Europe) and ISO (International).\n\n- Timed Run test to measure your 0-60mph, 0-60ft, 0-1/8mi, 0-1/4mi, 0-100km/h, 0-20m, 0-200m, 0-400m,  and much more.\n\n- Use of your phone accelerometer at its maximum frequency and advanced signal processing for smoothed curves.\n\n- Custom choice of units from a large choice: Hp, Ch, Cv, Kw, Nm, Ft.Lb, mKg, Mph, Km/h, m, ft, G, m/s², psi, inHg, mBar, °C, °F\n\n- Export reports in Tab Separated Value format and PNG"

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Then you need a gear calculator on your iPhone and your Apple Watch.\n\nBuilt by track racers for track racers, the Track Gear Calculator supports chainrings from 44 to 56 teeth and cogs from 12 to 20 teeth. It includes a speed/cadence calculator, and can calculate the next gear up or down using only the gears in your track bag.\n\nWant a bigger gear or a smaller gear? Track Gear Calculator works in reverse, too: just swipe the gear inches, and you'll get a new gear, up or down from where you are, using only the chainrings and cogs you have with you. You can also select from the standard 27\" nominal method for calculating gears, or more accurate actual wheel diameters, and you can see results in either Imperial gear inches or Metric development."

It automatically calculates your pressure groups and can even find your minimum surface interval. It’s quick and simple and super easy to use. \n\nTo calculate your pressure groups just enter your depth (feet or meters) and time (min) for your first dive. Then enter your surface interval between dives in minutes. After that enter your second dive depth and time the same way, and the program will calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nTo calculate your minimum surface interval between dives enter the depth and time of your first dive. Then enter the depth and time of your second dive. The program will now find your minimum surface interval and then calculate your final PG, ABT, RNT, TBT and new no decompression limit. \n\nThis program uses only the standard PADI dive tables. It can NOT calculate reverse profile dives. Reverse profile dives are when the second dive is deeper than the first. Unless you absolutely know what you are doing always dive shallower than the last dive. \n\nDisclaimer: This application is not a replacement for diving tables, dive computers, or experience. Please do not rely on Ez Dive Planner as your sole dive planner and make sure to double check all information before diving.

      "label": "The 'YO YO Endurance Test' provides an important instrument for determining the level of physical efficiency of an athlete.\nThe physical capacity is evaluated quickly and easily by placing two cones spaced 20 meters each other.\nThe athlete has to run at full speed from one cone to another and then return again on the first cone. This path must be repeated for six times without any break, and get  the split times every time the athlete passes on the first cone.\n\nThis application will track all the split time and at the end will be calculated two parameters that determine the outcome of the test. More these values are low and better will be the athlete's performance.\n\nBasically the final result is given by a mathematical formula that processes the delta between the averages of the last two split times and the first two split times  and thereby the athlete's ability to maintain its maximum speed for a certain period of time.\n\nThe second value obtained on completion of the test, is the first result considering also the total time of the test.\n\nThe 'YO YO Endurance Test' can be used to determine the level of athletic in all sports (football, running, basketball, volleyball, cycling, tennis etc.)\nAt the end of the test you can get for each athlete the final result (eg. \"Above average\" or \"Poor\") and the Vo2Max estimate\n\nYou can manage more Athletes and save personal data and notes.\nYou can analyze test results.\nAutomatic Sync between devices thanks to iCloud\nInfo section where you can better understand how prepare the test and you can visit linked website and video where get more info about YO-YO Endurance Test\n\nIf you find this application useful, please give a positive review in the AppStore, so we can further improve and develop new options.\n\nFor any further information, please send an email to:\nsupport@bitandweb.com\n\nThanks"

You add the buttons that you need and aren’t bound by someone else’s predefined ideas of what is important to your team.\n\nFrequency statistics are displayed and data can be exported for number crunching. The time and duration of each note is recorded, allowing events to be imported into video analysis software from where valuable video coaching resources can be created.\n\nEasyTag-Note works as a standalone app but is also designed to integrate with Dartfish software. Use its Quick Import function to match tagged events to the corresponding moment on video. Now you can use Dartfish for editing, analysis and video presentations to your team.\n\nEasyTag-Note Features:\n• Create custom panels or easily modify the provided templates\n• Make your panel unique – you decide what’s important.\n• Time stamping of fixed or open duration periods of activity\n• Pre-roll setting allows you to assess an event before deciding to tag it \n• Mark favourite events for later review.\n• Export data (CSV file) via email\n• Statistics display and bar graph representation of data\n• Dartfish Quick Import easily integrates your notational analysis with video. \n\nDartfish EasyTag-Note is an iOS 10 compatible update of our Easytag app and the little brother of Dartfish Note. No myDartfish subscription is required but it has more limited functionality than both these apps. \n\nAbout us: Dartfish has a pedigree in video analysis going back to 1998. We are proud to serve teams, federations and gold medallists from all round the world."

      "label": "CrewNerd turns your cell phone into an on-the-water training tool in any rowing shell, canoe, kayak or dragon boat - with no wiring! With a waterproof case, you can get real-time data during your workout and even relay it to your coach.\n\nUsing the accelerometer in your device, CrewNerd is able to accurately calculate your stroke rate as well as how much bounce (vertical movement) and stern check you are producing.  Speed, pace and distance are calculated via GPS.\n\n• Configurable display\n\nIn landscape mode there are up to six configurable data fields, and in portrait mode there are up to ten. Choose from the following:\n  • Stroke rate\n  • Elapsed time\n  • Distance\n  • Speed or pace\n  • Average speed or pace\n  • Heart rate\n  • Stroke count\n  • Interval count\n  • Meters per stroke\n  • Total distance\n  • Projected time and distance\n  • Check\n  • Bounce\n  • Course (direction)\n  • Time of day\n\nSet the top line to be double-height to make the most important data stand out. In portrait mode, the top two lines can both be made double-height.\n\n• Custom workouts\n\nSelect from one of the provided workouts, or create your own based on distance, time or strokes.  An auto-start feature starts the timer when the first stroke is taken, or you can set a “countdown” of 15 or 30 seconds before the timer starts to allow you to build up speed before starting a piece.\n\n• Custom courses\n\nCreate custom by plotting your start and finish lines on a map. The application will start the timer automatically when you cross the start line and stop when you reach the finish. This is great for hands free operation in long distance races or for set routes you routinely use.\n\n• Review your data\n\nAll workout data is recorded and can be reviewed on the device or uploaded directly to Strava, Concept2, TrainingPeaks, Sportlyzer, or the Apple Health app. On the history page for your practice, press \"Select export type\" to choose one of these options.\n\nYou can also export data as GPX, KML, TCX, or CSV. You can view a map of your workout or view an interval data chart with configurable distance markers showing split times on your phone.\n\n• Heart rate\n\nCrewNerd supports all Bluetooth Smart heart rate monitors.\n\n• Live position tracking\n\nStream your workout data as it happens to any web browser via CrewNerd.com.\n\n• VoiceOver support\n\nFor blind and vision-impaired athletes, CrewNerd provides audible feedback during your workouts. Configure the content and timing of the announcements to meet your needs.\n\n• For coaches\n\nUse custom workouts to keep your practices on target. In coach mode, you can tap anywhere on the screen to check stroke rate. CrewNerd can also be used on the iPad for a larger display.\n\nWaterproof cases are available to protect your iPhone on the water. See our web site for more information."

      "label": "This is the original Kart Chassis Setup app (you'll see a fake app in the App Store).\n\nSet up your kart chassis analyzing information like cold and hot tyre pressures, tyre temperatures and behaviour in corners. Using all the data the application will give you some recommendations about how to adjust your chassis in order to resolve any set up problem that you're suffering. For each advice, you'll find an explanation about the adjustment. The explanation usually contains pictures to be more understandable.\n\nThe application is valid for sprint (road) karts and for all classes (adult or senior, cadet, junior). It's usefull for both experienced or novice drivers. For the former, it'll be a second opinion about what's wrong with the chassis setup, and for novices it will teach them the secrets of the chassis adjustments and chassis setup.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Driving: in this tab you'll have to inform about how the driver feels the behaviour of the kart in corners. In the first fields, \"Behaviour in corners\" you'll have to enter the information about what the driver is feeling and in which grade, that is, if it's very noticeable or not. These are the most important information used by the application to calculate the advices. You can enter, in this tab, if the track is clockwise or anti-clockwise, and the current temperature. Both elements are taking into consideration for calculations.\nBesides, you can indicate some information about the driver in order to adjust the calculations for his weight and chassis special features. \n\n- Pressure: in this tab you can inform about the hot and cold pressures of each tyre. \n\n- Temperature: you can set in this screen the information about hot tyre temperatures in the inside, middle and outside of the patch.\n\n- Results: this tab will show you some recommendations related on which adjustments you can do to solve any problem in the chassis setup that you can be suffering. A screen with detailed information about the adjustment will be shown. This explanation is very important in the \"Modify pressures\" advice, because it will show how much you should adjust your pressures.\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, PSI and BAR for pressures, lb and kg for weights."

Kindle books you have purchased on Amazon will automatically appear in your app. Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime members can select and download Kindle books directly in the app.\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT GREAT READ\n• Read the books you buy on Amazon in the Kindle app. Choose from over six million Kindle books (including those with Audible narration), magazines, and comics and start reading in seconds. Explore Amazon Charts best sellers and titles across genres like romance, science fiction, children’s books, self-help, religion, nonfiction, and more—and try any book with a free sample straight from the Kindle app.\n\n• Kindle Unlimited members can enjoy unlimited reading and listening, with the freedom to explore over 1 million titles, thousands of audiobooks, and current magazines. \n\n• Over 1,000 books, magazines, comics, and more included with Amazon Prime.\n\n• Kindle Vella brings you stories released one short episode at a time. The first three episodes of every story are always free--after that, purchase Tokens and redeem them to unlock episodes. Tokens may only be used to unlock Kindle Vella story episodes and are available for In-App purchase. Kindle Vella and In-App purchase of Tokens are currently only available in the US. \n\nGO BEYOND PAPER\nTurn your iPhone or iPad into a book with the free Kindle app—so you can read anytime, anywhere. Explore these reading features in the Kindle app:\n\n• Read your way. Customize your text size, font type, margins, text alignment, and orientation (portrait or landscape)—and choose whether to turn pages from left to right or continuously scroll. Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

Sikhs read nitnems at Gurdwaras. The Nit-Nem bani's usually include the Panj bania (5 bani'below) which are read daily by baptized Sikhs in the morning between 3:00 am and 6:00 am (this period is considered as Amrit Vela or the Ambrosial Hours) and 'Rehras Sahib' in the evening 6pm and 'Kirtan Sohila' at night 9pm.\n\n1. 'Japji Sahib' (amritvela)\n2. 'Jaap Sahib' (amritvela)\n3. 'Tav-Prasad' Savaiye(morning)\n4. 'Chaupai Sahib' (morning)\n5. 'Anand Sahib' (All 40 Shabads) (morning)\n6. 'Rehras Sahib' (evening)\n7. 'Kirtan Sohila' (night)\n\nThe 5 morning Banis are usually recited in the early morning while Rehras is read in the evening (around 6pm.) and Kirtan Sohila is recited just before going to sleep at night. More prayers may be added to the Sikh's liking.\n\nWe do hope that you will really like reading/ listening to Nitnem Path on our app. Thanks."

It was composed by Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism. It is headed by Mool Mantra and followed by 38 paudis (stanzas) and completed with a final Salok at the end of this composition.\n\nJapji Sahib is believed to be the first composition of Guru Nanak, and considered in Sikhism as the faith's most comprehensive essence.\n[1] It is regarded amongst the most important Bani or 'set of verses' by the Sikhs, as it is first Bani in Nitnem. It is notable for its discourse on what is true worship and the nature of God. It states that God is indescribable, the only true form of worship is acceptance of God, and to remain one with loving God, always."

This set of Hymns or Bani is very popular among the Sikhs, who frequently recite it in their places of worship called Gurdwaras and at home. The full recital takes about 90 minutes and is normally undertaken by everyone in the congregation. According to Sikh doctrine, this Bani is believed to bring peace to one's mind and compoundly peace to the world. This set of 192 hymns were compiled by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev Ji."

We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests.

I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter. \n\n\nمن صناع Quran.com يأتي تطبيق القرآن للأجهزة المحمولة، تطبيق للمصحف ذو صفحات جميلة خالي تماما من الاعلانات.\n\nلقد أصبح من السهل قراءة القرآن بالشارع، وحفظه، والاستماع إلى قارئك المفضل.\n\nهذا هو مجرد بداية لتطبيق القرآن. سنعمل على تحديث التطبيق بشكل منتظم إن شاء الله، ونحب أن نسمع رأيك ومتطلبتك. يمكنك الوصول إلينا عن طريق البريد الإلكتروني ios@quran.com\n\nعَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة."

      "label": "Guru Granth Sahib is the religious scripture of Sikhism, regarded by Sikhs as the final, sovereign, and eternal living Guru following the lineage of the ten human Gurus of the Sikh religion. Adi Granth, the first rendition, was compiled by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, added one salok, dohra mahala 9 ang, 1429 and all 115 hymns of Guru Tegh Bahadur. This second rendition came to be known as Sri Guru Granth Sahib.\n\nThe text consists of 1430 angs (pages) and 6,000 shabads (line compositions), which are poetically rendered and set to a rhythmic ancient north Indian classical form of music. The bulk of the scripture is divided into thirty-one ragas, with each Granth raga subdivided according to length and author. The hymns in the scripture are arranged primarily by the ragas in which they are read. The Guru Granth Sahib is written in the Gurmukhi script, in various languages, including Lahnda (Western Punjabi), Braj Bhasha, Khariboli, Sanskrit, Sindhi, and Persian. Copies in these languages often have the generic title of Sant Bhasha.\n\nGuru Granth Sahib was composed by seven Sikh Gurus: Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Angad Dev, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan Dev, Guru Hargobind and Guru Tegh Bahadur. Guru Gobind Singh added 1 sloakh in mahala 9 Ang 1429. It also contains the traditions and teachings of Indian sants (saints), such as Ravidas, Ramananda, Kabir and Namdev among others, and two Muslim Sufi saints Bhagat Bhikan and Sheikh Farid.\n\nThe vision in the Guru Granth Sahib is of a society based on divine justice without oppression of any kind."

      "label": "Bhagavad Gita is knowledge of five basic truths and the relationship of each truth to the other: These five truths are Krishna, or God, the individual soul, the material world, action in this world, and time. The Gita lucidly explains the nature of consciousness, the self, and the universe. It is the essence of India's spiritual wisdom.\n\nBhagavad Gita, is a part of the 5th Veda (written by Vedavyasa - ancient Indian saint) and Indian Epic - Mahabharata. It was narrated for the first time in the battle of Kurukshetra, by Lord Krishna to Arjun.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita also referred to as Gita, is a 700–verse Dharmic scripture that is part of the ancient Sanskrit epic Mahabharata. This scripture contains a conversation between Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide Krishna on a variety of philosophical issues.\n\nFaced with a fratricidal war, a despondent Arjuna turns to his charioteer Krishna for counsel on the battlefield. Krishna, through the course of the Bhagavad Gita, imparts to Arjuna wisdom, the path to devotion, and the doctrine of selfless action. The Bhagavad Gita upholds the essence and the philosophical tradition of the Upanishads. However, unlike the rigorous monism of the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita also integrates dualism and theism.\n\nNumerous commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita with widely differing views on the essentials, beginning with Adi Sankara's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita in the eighth century CE. Commentators see the setting of the Bhagavad Gita in a battlefield as an allegory for the ethical and moral struggles of the human life. The Bhagavad Gita's call for selfless action inspired many leaders of the Indian independence movement including Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who referred to the Bhagavad Gita as his \"spiritual dictionary\".\n\n•All 700 Sanskrit Shlokas with Hindi translation and description\n• Bookmark your favorite Bhagavad Gita shlokas/verses\n• Fast and responsive user interface\n• Share feature to easily send your favorite Bhagavad Gita shloka/verse to your friends\n• App fully functional without internet\n\nPlease take out a minute to Rate and Review our app.\n\nJai Shri Krishna!!!\n\nAssuming it is out of copyright protection.\nImage License: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Krishna_and_arjun_in_mahabharat_images.jpg"

      "label": "Bhagavad Gita is knowledge of five basic truths and the relationship of each truth to the other: These five truths are Krishna, or God, the individual soul, the material world, action in this world, and time. The Gita lucidly explains the nature of consciousness, the self, and the universe. It is the essence of India's spiritual wisdom.\n\nBhagavad Gita, is a part of the 5th Veda (written by Vedavyasa - ancient Indian saint) and Indian Epic - Mahabharata. It was narrated for the first time in the battle of Kurukshetra, by Lord Krishna to Arjun.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita also referred to as Gita, is a 700–verse Dharmic scripture that is part of the ancient Sanskrit epic Mahabharata. This scripture contains a conversation between Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide Krishna on a variety of philosophical issues.\n\nFaced with a fratricidal war, a despondent Arjuna turns to his charioteer Krishna for counsel on the battlefield. Krishna, through the course of the Bhagavad Gita, imparts to Arjuna wisdom, the path to devotion, and the doctrine of selfless action. The Bhagavad Gita upholds the essence and the philosophical tradition of the Upanishads. However, unlike the rigorous monism of the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita also integrates dualism and theism.\n\nNumerous commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita with widely differing views on the essentials, beginning with Adi Sankara's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita in the eighth century CE. Commentators see the setting of the Bhagavad Gita in a battlefield as an allegory for the ethical and moral struggles of the human life. The Bhagavad Gita's call for selfless action inspired many leaders of the Indian independence movement including Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who referred to the Bhagavad Gita as his \"spiritual dictionary\".\n\n•All 700 Sanskrit Shlokas with Hindi translation and description\n• Bookmark your favorite Bhagavad Gita shlokas/verses\n• Fast and responsive user interface\n• Share feature to easily send your favorite Bhagavad Gita shloka/verse to your friends\n• App fully functional without internet\n\nPlease take out a minute to Rate and Review our app.\n\nJai Shri Krishna!!!\n\nAssuming it is out of copyright protection.\nImage License: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Krishna_and_arjun_in_mahabharat_images.jpg"

It is a lengthy composition, written by Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru. \n\nThe sacred prayer spans 35 pages from page 262 to page 296 of the Guru Granth Sahib. Surprisingly, many ardent Sikhs include the recitation of this Bani in their daily regimen of Nitnem. \n\nThe physical site, where the Guru around AD 1602-03 composed this composition was once enclosed by a dense wood. The location is still marked on the bank of the Ramsar pool in the city of Amritsar, near the famous Golden Temple the Harimandir Sahib.\n\nKey Features of the app Sukhmani Sahib:\n\n1) One can listen to path using soft keys(Play, Pause or Stop).\n\n2) Meaning of the path on every page.\n\n3) One can change the text size (i.e. increase or decrease) within app.\n\n4) One can select path language from Gurmukhi, Hindi and English.\n\n5) One can share this app with friends and family.\n\n6) Themes: User can change theme. \n\n7) User can use Go option to quickly go to any page.\n\nThe design of app is very simple.\n\nWe hope you will like our app.\n\nPlease rate us and if you have any feedback or suggestion, you can contact us via email: care.happyinfotech@gmail.com"

You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

The Bhagavad Gita, or The Geetha as it is popularly known, is a part of the epic Mahabharatam. The epic describes the war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas on the battlefield of Kuru-kshetra.\n\nBhagavath gita is the discourse given by Krishna to Arjuna just before the war is about to begin. Krishna is identified as God. His words contain the essence of Vedic wisdom, the keystone of Hinduism.\n\nBhagavad Gita is knowledge of five basic truths :-\nIshvara – The Supreme Lord\nJiva – The Living Entity\nPrakruti – The Material Nature\nKala – Eternal Time\nKarma – Activities\n\nBhagavad-Gita consists of 18 chapters with 700 slokas. Each Chapter is called a yoga. Yoga is the science of the individual consciousness attaining communion with Ultimate consciousness. So each chapter is a highly specialised yoga revealing path of attaining realisation of the Ultimate Truth.\n\nEighteen Chapters of Bhagavad Geeta are :- \n\nArjunaVishada, Sankhya, Karma, Jnana, Karma Sanyasa, Akshara Bhramaha, Raja Vidhya, Vibhooti, Vishvaroopadarshana, Bhakti, KshetraKshetraVibhagaYoga, \nGunatrayaVibhaga, Purashottama, Divaasura Sampadhvibhaga, ShraddatrayaVibhaga, MokshaSanyasa Yogas\n\nThis Bhagavad Gita contains all 18 chapters with slokas with vivarana, Gita saramsam, sri krishnuni jananam, Sri krishna slokas and astotharamulu.\n\nBhagavad Geetha Features:\n----------------------------\nShare slokas\nTrack completed slokas\nAdd slokas to favourites\nShare Greeting cards\nGenerate cards with quotes\nFestivals List\nEnglish translation with all Bhagvath Geeta SlokasPlay audio.\n\n\nBhagavad-gita was injected into the Mahabharata, an action-packed narrative of an important era in ancient Indian politics.Sri Krishna speaks for the benefit of all souls who have forgotten their eternal nature, the ultimate goal of existence, and their eternal relationship with Him.\n\nJai Shree Krishna !!"

      "label": "The Indian Evidence Act, originally passed in India by the Imperial Legislative Council in 1872, during the British Raj, contains a set of rules and allied issues governing admissibility of evidence in the Indian courts of law.\n\nThe Indian Evidence Act, identified as Act no. 1 of 1872, and called the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, has eleven chapters and 167 sections, and came into force 1 September 1872. At that time, India was a part of the British Empire. Over a period of more than 125 years since its enactment, the Indian Evidence Act has basically retained its original form except certain amendments from time to time.\n\nAmendments:\n\nThe Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2005\n\nThe enactment and adoption of the Indian Evidence Act was a path-breaking judicial measure introduced in India, which changed the entire system of concepts pertaining to admissibility of evidences in the Indian courts of law. Until then, the rules of evidences were based on the traditional legal systems of different social groups and communities of India and were different for different people depending on caste, community, faith and social position. The Indian Evidence Act introduced a standard set of law applicable to all Indians.\n\nThe law is mainly based upon the firm work by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, who could be called the founding father of this comprehensive piece of legislation."

This bani is present in Charitar 404 of Dasam Granth in Bani Ath Pakhyan Chairtar Likhyatey. This Bani is one of the five Banis recited by the initiated Sikh every morning. It is also a part of evening prayer of the Sikhs called Rehras sahib. The Benti Chaupai can be read at any time during the day to provide protection, positive focus and energy.\n\nIt is short composition which usually takes less than about 5 minutes to recite at a slow pace; it is written in simple Punjabi language and can be easily understood by most speakers of this language.\nChaupai is the short name for the Sikh prayer or Gurbani whose full name is Kabiobach Bainti Chaupai. This composition is part of the second most important Sikh Holy Book called the Dasam Granth. The Bani comes after the section called Charitropakhyan. Many 'charitars' (tricks; deceptions) of the world are shown in Charitropakhyan. Charitars highlight negative energies that can be found on earth. After composing Charitars, the tenth master composed the section that includes this particular bani. It is an Ardas or 'request' or 'sincere plea' to God for protection.\nThe sub-sections of this composition are as follows:\nKabiyo Bach Benti Chaupai\nArril and Chaupai (which follows Benti Chaupai as written in the Sri Dasam Granth. These short stanzas act as a conclusion to this Bani before the Zafarnama)\nSavaiye and Dohra (compiled from an earlier section of Sri Dasam Granth)"

      "label": "Bhagavad Gita is knowledge of five basic truths and the relationship of each truth to the other: These five truths are Krishna, or God, the individual soul, the material world, action in this world, and time. The Gita lucidly explains the nature of consciousness, the self, and the universe. It is the essence of India's spiritual wisdom.\n\nBhagavad Gita, is a part of the 5th Veda (written by Vedavyasa - ancient Indian saint) and Indian Epic - Mahabharata. It was narrated for the first time in the battle of Kurukshetra, by Lord Krishna to Arjun.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita, also referred to as Gita, is a 700–verse Dharmic scripture that is part of the ancient Sanskrit epic Mahabharata. This scripture contains a conversation between Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide Krishna on a variety of philosophical issues.\n\nFaced with a fratricidal war, a despondent Arjuna turns to his charioteer Krishna for counsel on the battlefield. Krishna, through the course of the Bhagavad Gita, imparts to Arjuna wisdom, the path to devotion, and the doctrine of selfless action. The Bhagavad Gita upholds the essence and the philosophical tradition of the Upanishads. However, unlike the rigorous monism of the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita also integrates dualism and theism.\n\nNumerous commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita with widely differing views on the essentials, beginning with Adi Sankara's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita in the eighth century CE. Commentators see the setting of the Bhagavad Gita in a battlefield as an allegory for the ethical and moral struggles of the human life. The Bhagavad Gita's call for selfless action inspired many leaders of the Indian independence movement including Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who referred to the Bhagavad Gita as his \"spiritual dictionary\".\n\nThe only available Gujarati translation of Bhagavad Gita is made available on this app. One would derive great pleasure by just reading the Gujarati version as it keep intact the storyline. The tune and meters of poetry are also not exactly replicated in Gujarati yet, in their own they are pretty consistent.\n\nFeatures Of Bhagavad gita in Gujarati :\n•All 700 Sanskrit Shlokas with Gujarati translation and description\n• Bookmark your favorite Bhagavad Gita shlokas / verses in Gujarati\n• Fast and responsive user interface for Gita in Gujarati\n• Share feature to easily send your favorite Bhagavad Gita shloka / verse to your friends in Gujarati\n• App fully functional without internet"

It is a Sikh prayer that is done before performing or after undertaking any significant task; after reciting the daily Banis (prayers); or completion of a service like the Paath, kirtan (hymn-singing) program or any other religious program. In Sikhism, these prayers are also said before and after eating. The prayer is a plea to God to support and help the devotee with whatever he or she is about to undertake or has done.\n\nThe Ardas is usually done standing up with 'folded hands'. The beginning of the Ardas is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. When it comes to the conclusion of this prayer, the devotee uses:\nThe word Waheguru - 'Waheguru please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake' when starting a new task.\n\nOr the words Akal Purakh - 'Akal Purakh, having completed the hymn-singing, we ask for your continued blessings so that we can continue with your memory and remember you at all times'."

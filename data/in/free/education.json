Created by a Stanford grad, this baby learning program will help you unlock your child’s incredible potential early on in life. Do you feel confused or concerned about what to expect when it comes to infant development? Do you worry that your infant will be behind the curve on growth of skills? Whether you’re still in your pregnancy journey or you’ve already brought home your newborn baby, you’re right to wonder how you can help them succeed. And now look no further, because Prodigy Baby has the solution for you!\n\nTEACH YOUR BABY\nProdigy Baby is a unique baby learning system that allows you to reach baby milestones early through a variety of developmental activities. And best of all, the framework includes NO SCREENTIME for babies: we’re interested in raising superstars, not gluing your babies to a screen. Through our revolutionary learning system, your child can:\nLearn to read (as early as age 2!)\nLearn to speak\nLearn numbers and math\nDevelop creativity\nDevelop incredible athletic skills\nAnd so much more!\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR NEEDS\nWhen you download the Prodigy Baby app, you will be able to take a quiz regarding your baby’s stage of development and the skills and developmental milestones you wish to jumpstart. Once you’ve completed the quiz, you will receive a program recommendation for your baby care and learning system. The baby activities are specifically designed to help unlock particular abilities, not just as a random collection of things to do - the difference will show!\n\nBABY GAMES ON A BABY SCHEDULE\nThe wonder weeks from age 0-2 are an important, but particular period of baby development. For this reason, we don’t want to overwhelm the baby or the parenting experience. With this in mind, the Prodigy Baby programs are super easy and convenient and require only 5 minutes of daily developmental activities with the baby.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe Prodigy Baby app is based on the Prodigy Baby framework. Developed after 2,000+ hours of study, it is a simple but powerful step-by-step program created to help your baby ignite their hidden genius potential efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe framework combines the methodologies of the greatest parenting minds in the world, including Glenn Doman, Makoto Shichida, Maria Montessori, Waldorf, and others, to create a fun, accelerated learning system that helps your child unleash their hidden talents.\n \nWEEKLY PLANS\nExplore our learning system for newborns which is carefully planned with weekly schedules for newborn baby games. We know parents are not teachers and we don’t want you to be. So don’t worry about the development planning, that’s all on us. Simply follow the program laid out and watch the baby learning activities take root! Try keeping a baby learning growth chart and watch yourself be blown away! You may think you’re seeing things, but the milestone tracker can’t lie.\n\nDownload today and see why we’ve been featured in The Economic Times, The Times of India, Entrepreneur Magazine, and more! Prodigy Baby - because you want more than a child development app, you want a genius development app!\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.theprodigybaby.com/terms-of-use"

Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

      "label": "The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is the main criminal code of India. It is a comprehensive code intended to cover all substantive aspects of criminal law. The code was drafted in 1860 on the recommendations of first law commission of India established in 1834 under the Charter Act of 1833 under the Chairmanship of Thomas Babington Macaulay. It came into force in British India during the early British Raj period in 1862. However, it did not apply automatically in the Princely states, which had their own courts and legal systems until the 1940s. The Code has since been amended several times and is now supplemented by other criminal provisions.\n\nAfter the partition of the British Indian Empire, the Indian Penal Code was inherited by its successor states, the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan, where it continues independently as the Pakistan Penal Code. The Ranbir Penal Code (RPC) applicable in Jammu and Kashmir is also based on this Code. After the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, the code continued in force there. The Code was also adopted by the British colonial authorities in Colonial Burma, Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), the Straits Settlements (now part of Malaysia), Singapore and Brunei, and remains the basis of the criminal codes in those countries.\n\nThe objective of this Act is to provide a general penal code for India. Though not an initial objective, the Act does not repeal the penal laws which were in force at the time of coming into force in India. This was so because the Code does not contain all the offenses and it was possible that some offenses might have still been left out of the Code, which were not intended to be exempted from penal consequences. Though this Code consolidates the whole of the law on the subject and is exhaustive on the matters in respect of which it declares the law, many more penal statutes governing various offenses have been created in addition to the code.\n\nThe Indian Penal Code of 1860, sub-divided into twenty-three chapters, comprises five hundred and eleven sections. The Code starts with an introduction, provides explanations and exceptions used in it, and covers a wide range of offenses. \n\nDownload now and enjoy reading it :-)"

The maximum cost (interest & processing fee) can go up to 36% APR (Annual Percentage Rate) based on an individual’s credit profile, although most of our customers incur much lower cost. As an example, if you take a personal loan of Rs.20,000 for a tenure of 12 months at 20% interest rate, you will have to pay a processing fee of Rs.708 (3% of loan amount & GST) and your EMI will be Rs.1853.

It lets you do both card & UPI transactions from one place. It has an easy and transparent interface and also lets you track your spends without causing a migraine.

Get used to assured cashback of up to 2% on all spends and new offers every week (check out spark). You just need to be 18+ years old to apply. \n\nslice UPI\nWhy switch apps when you can also pay via slice UPI? Our intuitive design lets you scan & pay in a flash or send money to friends with ease. We’ve also done away with boring and hard-to-remember UPI IDs, and introduced super cool &IDs instead. &MoneyLisa? &RichieRich? &ForeverBroke? Who are you gonna be?\n\n\nNo-cost EMI Gift vouchers\nMake the most of online shopping with our no-cost EMI vouchers of up to 6 months from Myntra, Flipkart, Amazon, MakeMyTrip and many more! The world of e-commerce is your oyster. \n\nStill need a reason to apply? Here are 3 more: \n\n- The slice card is a free PPI card in partnership with SBM Bank and VISA. It has absolutely zero annual and joining fees and no hidden charges and you can borrow upto ₹10L for your expenses via this card. This gives you the freedom to buy now and pay later next month for free, so that your wishlist can finally become your shopping list. (You're welcome.) \n\n- The slice app has everything you need to track your payments, manage your spends, repay your dues, transfer money to friends, and even get help from customer support.

No Spam, No Ads - ever!\n\nNow check & track your CIBIL score along with your Experian credit score with OneScore. Download the latest version of OneScore to check your CIBIL score now!\n\nEveryone with a loan or credit card has a credit score, & staying up to date on yours is crucial. Your credit score affects your major purchases - your car, your house, & even paying for your education. It makes sense to not only track your credit score but also take the necessary steps to improve it.\n\nOneScore helps you understand your credit score for free & monitor it regularly. We give you insights on what makes up your score & alert you when something changes in your report. Using OneScore does not hurt your score (but not using it may!).\n\nWe understand that your credit score is a key piece of personal information. Don’t worry, unlike other apps that spam you with loan offers, we do not use this information for sourcing loans for financial institutions. None of your information is shared with any third parties or institutions.\n\n\nNo Ads, No Unnecessary App Permissions & Trusted for life!\n\nInconsistent email ids across accounts? Using too much of your credit card limits? Someone enquiring in the Bureau on your behalf? We will highlight all small & large aspects of your score to help you decide if you wish to act upon or change them to improve your score.\n\nThere are 4 credit bureaus in India -  Experian, Equifax & CRIF High Mark. OneScore shows your CIBIL credit score & Experian credit score & helps you keep track of both of them individually.\n\nKey Features\n\n◼ Free Credit Report: Track your score on the go & understand the factors that impact your score.

It indicates how responsible you are likely to be in paying off your balances. \n\n◼ Credit is scored on a scale that ranges from 300 to 900. The higher the number, the better off you are. Get started on your credit journey here!\n\n◼ Keeping a good credit score is beneficial while applying for a job. Employers check credit scores to check how responsible the candidate is before hiring.\n\nWho can enroll on OneScore?\n\nAnybody with a loan or credit card can get OneScore & check their फ्री क्रेडिट स्कोर. You need to be over the age of 18 with a valid PAN card number that can be matched to a credit profile from the Experian credit bureau. \n\nWhat info do I need to have handy when I sign up?\n\nTo sign up, we'll ask you for some basic personal information such as your mobile number, email ID & name. Next, we will authenticate you with a One Time Password (OTP) sent to your registered mobile number. In case we are not able to find your credit report, we may ask you for some additional information such as your PAN Number, Date of Birth.\n\nWill using OneScore hurt my credit score?\n\nIt won’t. You can use all OneScore features without affecting your credit score.\n\nProudly Made with love in India."

Interest rates starting from as low as 13% per annum* for 3 to 36 months. We offer you the benefits of an easy personal loan and credit card combined.\n\nFor salaried employees only! Minimum salary = ₹30,000 per month.\n\nIf you need money, view MoneyTap as your first choice for loans.\n\nFees\nFor ₹1,00,000 borrowed for 1 year, with interest rate @13% per annum*, a user would pay:\n-> Processing fee (@ 2%) = ₹2,000 + GST = ₹2,360\n-> (Line setup fee of ₹499+GST = ₹588/- to be paid before starting the credit line)\n-> Interest = ₹7,181\n-> EMI = ₹8,932\nTotal amount to be repaid after a year = ₹1,10,129/-\n*Interest Rate varies based on your risk profile\nThe maximum Annual Interest Rate can go up to 36% (However, only a fraction of our customers get an interest rate higher than 30% per annum)\n\nWe are India’s first credit line based personal loan app in partnership with leading banks and NBFCs.

Now, the interest will only be charged on ₹50,000. Ajay still has access to ₹4,50,000 whenever he has another emergency without paying any interest on it until he withdraws any amount.\n\nWhat features make MoneyTap convenient?\n● 100% paperless process, no bank visits\n● You can use any amount from your available credit line\n● Make UPI transactions directly from your Credit Line\n\nDocuments required\n● Aadhaar number\n● Identity proof (Driving license/Voter id/Passport/Aadhaar/PAN)\n● Address proof (Driving license/Voter id/Passport/Aadhaar/Utility bills/bank statements)\n● Original passport photo/selfie\n● You can get a personal loan online on Aadhaar card. E-sign your application with registered mobile OTP for fast-track application\n\nHow does MoneyTap work?\n\nGet a personal loan in 4 simple steps:\n● Apply on the app and get approved in 4 minutes, create your profile, fill basic information such as age, city, PAN, & income to check eligibility\n● Instantly find out your pre-approved amount\n● Complete KYC verification\n● Transfer money to the bank account from the approved amount\n\nAvailable in 50+ cities.\n\nMoneyTap Personal Loan Application Uses\n● Phone pe loan - use it as an urgent personal loan. \n● Personal loans can be used for education, medical, marriage / wedding loan, home renovation loans, mobile / laptop loan, used car/ two-wheeler loan, travel loans, debt consolidation loan, etc.\n● The experience of an early salary for emergency cash.\n\nBonus: MoneyTap RBL credit card\n● 100% cash withdrawal from your credit card online\n● 50-days interest-free period\n\nSecurity & Protection of Privacy\nData security & privacy is a top priority at MoneyTap.

Similarly, you receive the bill for your purchases made between 16th to 30th/31st. \n\nIf you consistently fail to pay your Simpl bill timely, the pay later app charges a penalty of up to INR 250 excluding GST. However, if you inform Simpl of any technical issues that stopped you from paying the bill timely, there are no additional charges.\n\nYour spending limit changes depending on timely bill payments and usage. If you clear your dues consistently and timely, we can increase your spending limit. \n\nRead the FAQs here!: https://www.getsimpl.com/help/\n\nTo check if you’re pre-approved for Simpl, visit https://getsimpl.com"

As an example, if you take a personal loan of Rs.20,000 for a tenure of 12 months at 20% interest rate, you will have to pay a processing fee of Rs.708 (3% of loan amount & GST) and your EMI will be Rs.1853.

Using OneScore does not hurt your score (but not using it may!).\n\nWe understand that your credit score is a key piece of personal information. Don’t worry, unlike other apps that spam you with loan offers, we do not use this information for sourcing loans for financial institutions. None of your information is shared with any third parties or institutions.\n\n\nNo Ads, No Unnecessary App Permissions & Trusted for life!\n\nInconsistent email ids across accounts? Using too much of your credit card limits? Someone enquiring in the Bureau on your behalf?

It indicates how responsible you are likely to be in paying off your balances. \n\n◼ Credit is scored on a scale that ranges from 300 to 900. The higher the number, the better off you are. Get started on your credit journey here!\n\n◼ Keeping a good credit score is beneficial while applying for a job. Employers check credit scores to check how responsible the candidate is before hiring.\n\nWho can enroll on OneScore?\n\nAnybody with a loan or credit card can get OneScore & check their फ्री क्रेडिट स्कोर. You need to be over the age of 18 with a valid PAN card number that can be matched to a credit profile from the Experian credit bureau. \n\nWhat info do I need to have handy when I sign up?\n\nTo sign up, we'll ask you for some basic personal information such as your mobile number, email ID & name. Next, we will authenticate you with a One Time Password (OTP) sent to your registered mobile number. In case we are not able to find your credit report, we may ask you for some additional information such as your PAN Number, Date of Birth.\n\nWill using OneScore hurt my credit score?\n\nIt won’t.

Interest rates starting from as low as 13% per annum* for 3 to 36 months. We offer you the benefits of an easy personal loan and credit card combined.\n\nFor salaried employees only! Minimum salary = ₹30,000 per month.\n\nIf you need money, view MoneyTap as your first choice for loans.\n\nFees\nFor ₹1,00,000 borrowed for 1 year, with interest rate @13% per annum*, a user would pay:\n-> Processing fee (@ 2%) = ₹2,000 + GST = ₹2,360\n-> (Line setup fee of ₹499+GST = ₹588/- to be paid before starting the credit line)\n-> Interest = ₹7,181\n-> EMI = ₹8,932\nTotal amount to be repaid after a year = ₹1,10,129/-\n*Interest Rate varies based on your risk profile\nThe maximum Annual Interest Rate can go up to 36% (However, only a fraction of our customers get an interest rate higher than 30% per annum)\n\nWe are India’s first credit line based personal loan app in partnership with leading banks and NBFCs.

Now, the interest will only be charged on ₹50,000. Ajay still has access to ₹4,50,000 whenever he has another emergency without paying any interest on it until he withdraws any amount.\n\nWhat features make MoneyTap convenient?\n● 100% paperless process, no bank visits\n● You can use any amount from your available credit line\n● Make UPI transactions directly from your Credit Line\n\nDocuments required\n● Aadhaar number\n● Identity proof (Driving license/Voter id/Passport/Aadhaar/PAN)\n● Address proof (Driving license/Voter id/Passport/Aadhaar/Utility bills/bank statements)\n● Original passport photo/selfie\n● You can get a personal loan online on Aadhaar card.

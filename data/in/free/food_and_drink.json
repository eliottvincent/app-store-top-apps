      "label": "1. About TBSE\nConceptualized on the lines of our infamous stock market, TBSE is fun, unique and cutting-edge bar concept that allows customers to trade in alcohol and spirits, with prices starting from as low as MRP prices!\nIndia’s first stock market-based pub chain where the drink prices change based on real time demand, TBSE presents an experience similar to trading in the stock market - Think of it as happy hours where you control the prices of all the drinks, any time, every time! Being touted as the most technologically advanced bar in India, customers can also place an order via a specially developed app that lets you monitor prices and order in real time. Customers can compete with each other and the system to score the best prices on their choice of drinks. The brand has taken the nation by storm and has become the ‘place to be’ for revelers & also being added on the ‘must-go-to’ list of foreign expats & tourists alike.\n \n2. How it works\nTBSE will “trade”* in alcohol whilst making sure you have a great exchange (of conversation, ofcourse!). Starting with all prices starting at retail prices, the prices of your favourite drink rise in direct proportion to its consumption over a period of time at the bar. Every increasing peg/pint/shot/glass ordered by a patron increases its value margin, to be brought down once again if time is on your side (if orders for the same drink decrease over a period of time). Before you gasp in worry, our circuit breaker system will ensure that you get the best bang out of your buck always (whether your favourite stock be high or low)."

      "label": "We are all food connoisseurs and have enjoyed the magic of our mothers' hands at every festival and at every special event from birth to adulthood and beyond. But imagine being away from home and missing the delectable \"Ghar Jaisa, Maa Ke Haath Ka Khana?\" Or picture having a childhood favourite dish that just exists in your mind and never makes it to the centre of your dining table? \n\nThere are moments when we have a longing for original and rich flavours that bring us closer to our roots. Those flavours that we can relish only when we come home for a special occasion, during the festivities, or meeting relatives. While some people are eager to return to their hometowns ,the first chance they get, to experience their favourite cuisine with their family and friends, the vast majority of the 'young Indian workforce' remains put. Nevertheless, individuals who are stuck in a distant city, far from home, can rely on the support of India's food pioneers.\n\nJustMyRoots is one of India's leading intercity perishable and non-perishable food Tech platform, that delivers food within 24 hours from cities across the country. For instance, if someone in Delhi is craving Tundey Kebab from Lucknow, they can order their kebabs using JustMyRoots rather than waste time imagining the flavours . So, while utilising the technology at hand, ordering from a variety of restaurants and establishments that have been serving delicious cuisine for centuries ,appears to be a concept too brilliant to pass up. \n\nSo, the next time someone craves a taste of home, JustMyRoots, an Indian food pioneer that delivers meals from some of the most Heirloom Restaurants ,as well as, hundreds of other renowned eateries from over 20+ cities, is the only beacon at the end of the food tunnel.\n\nAre you craving for Authentic Hyderabadi Biryani from Hyderabad or 150 years old Tunday Kebabs from Lucknow or Misti Doi from Kolkata, worry not, Now, you need not travel to that city, you can simply Order via JustMyRoots and enjoy the food,from all your favourite restaurants,for which you feel nostalgic about, from various cities, at the comfort of your home!\n\nJustMyRoots is a food revolution, envisioned and created by a group of ex-corporates and ex-bankers with a fervent passion for good food. We are a food tech platform, proud pioneers in intercity perishable and non-perishable food delivery, which aims to connect people, back to their roots through food, delivering from iconic brands and restaurants from more than 20 cities all over the country.

We’re delivering, within a time frame of 12 hours, in 20000+pin codes across Metros, Tier1 & Tier2 cities and expanding!\n\nOur most unique service is DFH/ Direct From Home Service(Ma ke hath ka khana), wherein, children travelling, out of home for studies and work, can now relish, the food cooked at home, by their own mothers. The food is collected, packed in containers provided by Justmyroots, and delivered at the location, of the children, within 12 hours. Justmyroots, has managed to bridge the gap so efficiently and Home, just got a lot closer.\n\nHomesickness is like a wave that sweeps over you after one leave’s home—an overwhelming feeling that sometimes creates an existential void. Any expat will share, that, it is a mixed feeling of a deep longing for home, and everything associated with it. Food bears the essence of one’s belonging and aims to bridge the said gap, so essentially, the craving for those nostalgic aromas, never dies down, but actually gets stronger with time.\n\nNow, Justmyroots is proud to embark on a journey, in International turfs, to satiate, those gastronomical cravings, to help the NRI Diaspora, feel a little more connected to their roots.\n\nLet’s bask in nostalgia and keep the flames of tradition alive"

While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. It’s fun for the whole family; You’ll be playing this one for hours. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.\n\nHow to play Ludo King:\nThe objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\n\nAnother nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King.\n\nReady to roll the dice?! Make your move and become Ludo King."

A sequence is a group of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit, while a set is a group of 3 or 4 cards of the same value/rank but different suits. To form the required sequences and sets, you need to pick a card from the open/closed deck and discard a card to the open deck on each turn.\nWhen you have formed at least two sequences, including a pure sequence, and all your other cards are arranged in sequences or sets, you have to finish the game by discarding one of your cards to the “Finish Slot'' and declare your hand for your opponents to see. If your hand is valid, you win the game and cash prizes.\n\nRummy Game Rules:\nThe rules of this cash rummy game are very simple. Arrange all the 13 cards in your hand in sequences (at least two sequences), or sequences and sets. One of the sequences must be a pure sequence (one in which no card is replaced by a joker). All the remaining cards must be arranged in sequences or sets.\n\nDownload this amazing multiplayer cash rummy app & win big cash prizes daily while enjoying thrilling gaming on Junglee Rummy.\n\nQuick Links:\nHow To Play Rummy Card Game - https://www.jungleerummy.com/how-to-play/rummy-rules\nLegality - https://www.jungleerummy.com/legality\nResponsible Gaming - https://www.jungleerummy.com/responsiblegaming\nReach Us - support@jungleerummy.com"

It’s a simple yet challenging puzzle you won’t be able to put down.\n\nMatch blocks to complete lines and squares to remove them. Keep the board clean, and beat your high score.\n\nHow to play:\n\n- Drop the blocks on the 9x9 grid.\n- Fill up lines and squares to keep the board clean.\n- Complete Daily Challenges and get unique trophies.\n- Join Seasonal Events and get unique animated postcards.\n- Compete against other players in Tournaments, beat your high score, and climb the leaderboard.\n- Destroy several elements at once to make a Combo.\n- Make several successful moves in a row to get a Streak.\n- Customize the game with a theme of your choice.\n\nHow to become a Blockudoku® master?\n\n• There is no time limit, so no need to rush. Think one step ahead when faced with a difficult move. It might be your last one.\n• Try to place classic and wood blocks on the board to destroy lines or 3x3 squares with every move to keep the board from filling up.\n• Find your zen by balancing between destroying figures as quickly as possible and getting as many combos and streaks as you can to score higher.\n• Score more points by making streaks. The emptier the board, the better for you!\n• It's always risky to wait for a good block – you may quickly run out of moves. When you see a chance to destroy a figure, do it.\n\nRelieve stress, or train your brain with a relaxing, yet challenging, game of Blockudoku® anywhere, anytime!"

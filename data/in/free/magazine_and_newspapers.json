Rather than simply trying to be the first to report something, we share news in a concise manner that is accurate, adheres to journalistic ethics, and has been verified by multiple sources.\n\nBrifly began with a simple idea: \"News can be so much more simplified and even easier to consume.\"\n\nYou can read interesting news from a variety of categories and feeds in multiple languages. Download the app to stay up to date on the latest breaking news in 70 words or less from around the world, right at your fingertips, from:\nEntertainment\nEnvironment\nPolitics\nBusiness\nNational\nWorld News\nBrifly Exclusive\nCOVID-19\nTech/Science\nStartups\nBizzare\nCrime\nArt & Culture\nLegal\n\nHow is Brifly different than any other news organization?\n\nWe concluded that the most efficient way to consume news is through a CRISP, BRIEF, and SWIFT manner after conducting extensive research on how the average person consumes news. This way, the consumer not only saves time, but also has the assurance that the information is correct and verified.\n\nHere's how we distinguish ourselves:\nBrifly News is the brainchild of a diverse group of media professionals who want to change the way news is delivered and consumed.\nAt Brifly, we encourage our reporters to present facts rather than opinions, with an emphasis on fact-checking and verification.\nOur distinct news delivery format: keeping it brief, accurate, and easy to read.\nWe focus on delivering verified news that is consistent and credible using a hybrid approach (traditional + new media) to content presentation.\nWe set out to deliver news in an \"easy-to-consume\" format by leveraging the potential of social media, particularly among the younger demographic.\nBrifly's news is packaged as an Instagram visual or post, with short captions and a voice-over that elaborates on the news presented.\n\nThe following are the fundamental principles upon which Brifly was founded:\nVerified News: We verify news from a variety of sources.\nNo Opinion: Concentrate on Facts, Not Opinions\nNo Biased News: we deliver news Not views\nBrief: We provide 5Ws and 1H \nCrisp: We publish News in less than 70 words\nRegional News in Several Languages\n\nFeatures:\nSEARCH function for easier access to news that is important to you\nSimple to use Every news card has the option to Share, Save, or Report.\nBookmarks allow you to save news that you don't have time to read for later.\nDark mode is now available on all devices.\nThe Auto Video Play option allows videos to play automatically when they appear in the news card.\nYou can choose which topics are most important to you, from being notified of the latest COVID-19 alerts to receiving the most recent updates in technology, sports, entertainment, and business.\n\nDownload The Brifly App Now and Enjoy Scrolling Through Interesting Short News & Stories Like Never Before!\n\nFinally, we want to thank you for using the Brifly Short News app, and please don't forget to rate and review it on Apple Play Store.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\nSupport: contact@briflynews.com\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/briflynews/\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYol591WjQc4znqRlC1BI2g\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/briflynews/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/briflynews/\nWebsite: https://www.briflynews.com/"

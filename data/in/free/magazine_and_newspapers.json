      "label": "Noa brings you the world’s best journalism, curated by editors and read aloud by professional voice actors. We aim to provide multiple perspectives on trending news topics, through a highly involved curation process where Noa’s editors hand-pick the very best articles from the world's best publishers.\n\nIn a world with polarised opinions and ideology-driven media coverage, are you seeking multiple viewpoints? Start listening to Noa to save you time in exploring varying perspectives and to help you stay informed on the topics everyone is talking about.\n\nIt integrates easily into your daily or weekly routine. Listen while exercising, driving, cooking, or walking.\n\nTOP PUBLISHERS. ONE APP\nOur partnering publishers include\n\n• The Economist\n• Harvard Business Review\n• The Washington Post\n• The Telegraph\n• Bloomberg\n• The New York Times\n• Fast Company\n• Insider\n• MIT Technology Review\n• Foreign Affairs\n• The Independent\n• The Conversation\n• And more.\n\nOUR EDITORIAL PRINCIPLES\t\n1. Multiple Perspectives: Offer multiple perspectives from trusted sources and empower listeners to make up their own minds on where they stand on a topic.\n2. Thought-provoking: Present audio articles that inform, inspire, and offer fresh insights, through both a global and a national lens. Focus on opinion, feature, and analysis articles.\n3. Storytellers: Be storytellers and educators. Help our listeners understand global topics, and perspectives, while also telling the stories of the people behind the headlines.\n4. Global Impact: Ensure coverage and raise awareness of important topics, regardless of a topics popularity or ability to drive “clicks”. \n5. Fourth Estate: Uphold journalism’s values as a democratic check on power. And always celebrate great journalism.\n6. Embrace Complexity: Encourage thought and avoid black and white explanations that aren't followed with depth. The world is complicated and can seldom be explained in minutes. Our goal is to help listeners navigate it. \n\nAUDIO STORIES\nListening to the best journalism is a great way to learn and grow, especially when you don’t have time to read. Audio articles are produced and recorded daily by Noa’s talented voice actors – Sam Scholl, Adrienne Walker, Peter Hanly, Martin Buchanan, Les Smith, Grainne Brookfield and Jessie McGee. They’re probably in the booth recording as you read this!\n\nAUDIO SERIES\nEach day, Noa’s editor’s select the very best audio articles and add them to topic-specific playlists. Every Series begins with a short explainer – written by a Noa editor – that provides valuable context on the subject at hand before you dive in. Within 20-30 minutes, you’ll walk away fully informed.\n\nAUDIO FEATURES\nAlong with the usual audio features, you’ll find: CarPlay, AirPlay, Offline Mode, Sleep Timer, Playback Speed Adjustment, an editable Article Queue, and Rewind and Fast-forward.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nWe know you expect more. That’s why the Noa app also offers:\n• In-app chat (we respond quickly)\n• My Stats to view your daily streak and listening stats\n• Save, Download, and Follow\n• Share – articles and Series\n• Read Along\n\nALWAYS FREE\nYou can listen to the free tier of Noa without any need to pay. You’ll get a weekly article allowance and access to most of our publishers.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES\nBy choosing to support Noa with a monthly or annual subscription you’ll get unlimited, ad-free access to over 18k audio articles (and counting) from the world’s best publishers, including our Premium-only publications. We would love to welcome you as a member of Noa’s growing community.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY\nWe’re real people, just like you and we take great care to protect your data. Noa does not share your data with others or allow advertisers to track you. Your data is used solely for the purpose of providing you with the best news, learning, and listening experience possible.\n\nPrivacy: https://www.newsoveraudio.com/privacy\nTerms: https://www.newsoveraudio.com/terms"

Uttar Banga Sambad was the first daily newspaper in West Bengal to be published from outside Kolkata. It was soon accepted as the mouthpiece of North Bengal and today Uttar Banga Sambad has emerged as one of the largest circulated newspapers in the entire North East India .\n\nUttar Banga Sambad continues to dominate the media market in North Bengal with an overwhelming 55% market share while the combined circulation of the competition adds up to 45%. The circulation of Uttar Banga Sambad at 1,65,452 is more than Combined circulation of all Kolkata based dailies : 1,05,560 as per ABC data Jan~June 2017.\n\nNot one to rest on its laurels, Uttar Banga Sambad is continuously making efforts to evolve and improve and reach further into the heartland of North Bengal, tapping into hitherto unexplored markets. To this effort, we have set up two parallel lines of completely new high speed all colour printing set up with combined capacity of printing 32 pages in colour.\n\nThe competition for print newspapers these days is not only from the electronic media but also from the digital media. The key to strengthening the market share is concentrating on localised news, what is happening in the immediate vicinity of the reader, in addition to what is happening in the state, national and international arena, in decreasing order of importance. Read by more than 15 lakh readers everyday (Source: Indian Readership Survey) Uttar Banga Sambad today consists of four sub-regional editions : Siliguri, Coochbehar, Alipurduar and Malda. Siliguri, the Gateway to the North East has become an increasingly strategic city. With a network of offices across India , we are just a phone call away to cater to your needs.\n\nToday the UBS group consist of apart from the flagship Uttar Banga Sambad, All India Appointment Gazette - an English weekly newspaper on employment and career opportunities, Tathya Kendra - a Bengali family magazine, Sambad - a Bengali daily newspaper being published from Bardhaman having more than 6 lakh readers (Source: Indian Readership Survey 2009) in the Durgapur Asansol Industrial belt."

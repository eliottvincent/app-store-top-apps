From news and information to entertainment there will be something good for everyone from Shekinah.\nHeeding the call of our Lord to bear witness for truth in the modern era through the mass media, Br Santhosh Karumathra, together with a small group of committed people, took that challenging step of faith in the year 2017. Day by day...Stone by stone... the dream project was becoming a reality... Shekinah, in its literal meaning was proved... God's visible presence was revealed for his greater glory... We witnessed the unfolding of a new dimension out of the blue... And that was the SHEKINAH NEWS ...\nBeing a satellite Indian news channel, we have created vibes in the secular field and spiritual arena within a surprisingly short span of time. Driven by the unique mission of empowering our viewers with real, authentic and genuine news, we are committed to the task of enriching our content through debates, discussions, interactive encounters, spiritual nourishment and live telecasts. Built upon a firm foundation of prayer, we have proved our identity in developing a global impact through fighting against social evils, denouncing injustice and becoming the voice of the unheard...We promote the national integrity and unity of the country by taking strong steps against any such divisible forces. We have marked exceptional and outstanding performance through covering a wide range of multiple perspectives from news & information to entertainments. We hold on to the pledge of providing unbiased, unspoken and hidden accounts of current affairs from a distinct viewpoint; that is why we have succeeded in gathering a multitude of spectators all across the world..\n\nThe VISION leading to a MISSION\n\nShekinah News stands firm in the mission to witness for truth in the present scenario of various fake and misleading ventures… We bring buried facts and realities which are conveniently and intentionally silenced by so many medias... We create space for the face and voice of truth and thereby illuminate the darkness of ignorance through the light of knowledge... This dream vision of ours has been manifested in the form of an unparalleled media Mission, which is the SHEKINAH NEWS\n\nShekinah News started its test transmission on April 28, 2019. Soon, on 8 October 2019, we could go on air in its full strength. Blessed with a group of committed, highly spirited, God fearing, skilled and efficient team, we are moving forward with the unique and single mission to make a difference and to stand for truth..."

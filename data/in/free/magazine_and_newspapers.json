The cheapest items in those magazines are £65 for a t-shirt or £200 for a coat. I can't afford that, what can I get in River Island, Topman etc. that's right on trend. MFM does that brilliantly at an amazing price. I'd recommend this magazine to any man, at £8 a year you'll more than have enough leftover to buy what they recommend. Couldn't recommend it enough!” – owens681\n\n“Just the best magazine for just style and fashion!

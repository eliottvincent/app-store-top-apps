Within the application you can upgrade to full access, which brings you every page of the issue and a searchable archive of every issue of The Wire published since issue one from summer 1982.

These will remain in place if your subscription expires, unless your device removes them (for example when running low on disk space). Re-downloading issues requires a current subscription.\n\n• Swipe or tap the page edges to flip to next/previous page. \n• Use the animated thumbnail view to flick through the pages. \n• Pinch or double-tap pages to zoom. \n• Switch between single or double-page view.\n• Search the current issue or the archive. \n• Tap any page links to web sites, email addresses, phone numbers or maps. \n• Tap contents-page links to jump to a particular article. \n• Sync the latest issue to your device for offline reading (requires wi-fi). \n• Sync additional back issues by tapping the stars beside their names (requires wi-fi). \n• Network connection required otherwise. \n\nWe recommend first running the app within a wi-fi area so it can sync the latest issue to your device - after that you can use it anywhere.

      "label": "News application for Uttarbanga Sambad.\nOn May 19, 1980 Uttar Banga Sambad made a humble beginning with its Siliguri edition. Uttar Banga Sambad was the first daily newspaper in West Bengal to be published from outside Kolkata. It was soon accepted as the mouthpiece of North Bengal and today Uttar Banga Sambad has emerged as one of the largest circulated newspapers in the entire North East India .\n\nUttar Banga Sambad continues to dominate the media market in North Bengal with an overwhelming 55% market share while the combined circulation of the competition adds up to 45%. The circulation of Uttar Banga Sambad at 1,65,452 is more than Combined circulation of all Kolkata based dailies : 1,05,560 as per ABC data Jan~June 2017.\n\nNot one to rest on its laurels, Uttar Banga Sambad is continuously making efforts to evolve and improve and reach further into the heartland of North Bengal, tapping into hitherto unexplored markets. To this effort, we have set up two parallel lines of completely new high speed all colour printing set up with combined capacity of printing 32 pages in colour.\n\nThe competition for print newspapers these days is not only from the electronic media but also from the digital media. The key to strengthening the market share is concentrating on localised news, what is happening in the immediate vicinity of the reader, in addition to what is happening in the state, national and international arena, in decreasing order of importance. Read by more than 15 lakh readers everyday (Source: Indian Readership Survey) Uttar Banga Sambad today consists of four sub-regional editions : Siliguri, Coochbehar, Alipurduar and Malda. Siliguri, the Gateway to the North East has become an increasingly strategic city. With a network of offices across India , we are just a phone call away to cater to your needs.\n\nToday the UBS group consist of apart from the flagship Uttar Banga Sambad, All India Appointment Gazette - an English weekly newspaper on employment and career opportunities, Tathya Kendra - a Bengali family magazine, Sambad - a Bengali daily newspaper being published from Bardhaman having more than 6 lakh readers (Source: Indian Readership Survey 2009) in the Durgapur Asansol Industrial belt."

      "label": "Madhyamam is India's first international newspaper-with Gulf Madhyamam, the largest circulated newspaper in the Middle East, it is also the only Malayalam daily published from seven countries. Madhyamam is the third largest Malayalam daily in India in terms of circulation and advertisement volume. Now into its twenty-fifth year, it has grown into 19 editions including Gulf and online editions. \nBut it's not the quantitative merit that sets it apart. It places great value on quality, truth and credibility. Madhyamam, run by a Public Charitable Trust, is not linked to any interest group or business houses. Its news is often rated the most independent and truthful and its editorial fearless and impartial. The paper does not accept advertisements that exploit women's honour and offend human dignity, titillate base emotions, promote superstitions or dishonest business. The many public interest campaigns Madhyamam initiated by its investigative reporting, sacrificing much advertisement income, have helped to create a fiercely loyal readership for the paper. And the circle is growing wherever Malayalis live. \nMadhyamam has a strict code of ethics on news, views and advertisements. It believes that news is sacred and not to be tampered with. It also believes that comment should be free.Both are age-old norms but fast fading from the media under survival pressure. Madhyamam sets great store by universal human values that transcend boundaries of caste, race, religion and region. The paper has established beyond doubt that even in these days of crass profiteering, value-based journalism is viable, and that it still has adherents and public support. That is why it has grown in spite of its strict ethical codes. \n\nWeekly: As a decennial contribution to the cultural area of Malayalam, Madhyamam Weekly was launched on 19 Feb, 1998. The editorial team had at its head noted writer and journalist C.Radhakrishnan. In a matter of about 40 weeks it has established as a forerunner of Malayalam periodical journalism, true to its claim of providing a new reading culture. Besides literary pieces, in-depth political analyses and informative studies in science, sociology, politics and current affairs, it has also made its presence felt through trendsetting interventionist reportage of social evils and the struggle against them.\n\nMagazine Subscriptions are available for purchase inside this app. \n\nOne year subscription - $9.99 (automatically renewed until canceled)\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. \n\nYour iTunes account will automatically be charged at the same price for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period unless you change your subscription preferences in your account settings. \n\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your account settings after purchase on your device. \n\nNo cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n\nPlease visit http://www.magzter.com/privacy-policy for our Privacy Policy and http://www.magzter.com/terms-and-conditions for our Terms & Conditions"

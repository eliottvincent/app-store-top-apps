Goodbye medicines\n \n          We reboot your metabolic health to reduce and then totally eliminate \n          your dependence on medicine. For good. In the process, saving you \n          money and eliminating side effects.\n\n\n2. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) to track causes of your blood sugar spikes in real time\n\n          We provide biometric feedback through a CGM to show how your blood \n          sugar responds to food, exercise and other lifestyle habits so that you \n          maximise your health and reverse diabetes. \n\n\n3. No Fad dieting. Simple eating\n\n          We know the futility of fad dieting and the efficacy of simple eating, \n          when it comes to diabetes. That’s why we don’t starve you to reverse \n          your diabetes. Because, eating right is far more effective than eating \n          less.\n\n\n4. Most Compassionate Diabetes Experts in India\n\n          Our meticulous 5-step selection process followed by a custom \n          training program ensures you are guided by only the best.

We address the root cause of diabetes\n\n          The root cause of chronic high blood sugar is damaged metabolism \n          leading to insulin resistance. Our science-backed cutting edge \n          solution addresses insulin resistance to improve metabolic health and \n          reverse diabetes, without the need for medications.\n \n\nOur approach is designed for sustainability and long term organ healing\n\n          Our pioneering approach ensures long term B-cell function recovery, \n          prevention of glucose accumulation through nutrient dense food swaps \n          and active fitness components, prevention of excess fat generation in \n          liver and improved gut nutrient sensing and microbiota community.\n \n\nWe individualise and design for flexibility\n\n          No two diabetes experiences are the same. SugarFit’s evidence-based \n          approach works because we account for personal tastes, lifestyle \n          choices and metabolic condition, and meet each person where they are \n          through a combination of:\n \n          \nPrecision nutrition\n\n          Complex carb counted (what to eat), portion appropriated (how much) \n          and balanced schedule (when to eat). Our unique nutritional guidelines \n          will ensure lower blood sugar while allowing people to eat to \n          satisfaction and avoiding fad diets.\n\n          \nProgressive fitness & behavioural health advice\n\n          Breaking the movement inertia through specific interventions ensuring \n          gradual progression from inactive lifestyle to active lifestyle and \n          eventually goal based fitness. Further, counselling through approved \n          therapeutic techniques help alleviate stress, improve sleep and \n          emotional well being.\n \t \n          \nEmpathetic Coaching for sustained habits\n\n          Our expert led, personalised coaching will help users build healthy \n          routines around what they love to do, and where they need the most \n          support. Based on the latest evidence based practices, including \n          complex carbs, gut microbiome, food pattern and palette analysis, our \n          easy to achieve, intervention based approach solves for the root cause \n          of cues and cravings.\n\nThis app integrates with the Health app.\n\nREACH US:\n\nTo share feedback please email us at: hello@sugarfit.com"

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

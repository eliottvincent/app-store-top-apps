It is a 4-stringed instrument with a base made from cured pumpkin gourd and a stem made from wood.\n________________________________________\n\n◆ AND NOW PRESENTING ◆\niTanpura Lite is an electronic Tanpura for the iPhone and iPod Touch. It uses stereo digital sound to simulate a set of two tanpuras each of which can be tuned with a different string combination. It uses sounds sampled from real Hemraj tanpuras to provide beautiful yet realistic sound in a pleasing design. The sound quality has to be heard to be believed!\n________________________________________\n\n◆ FEATURES ◆\n√ Includes two 5-string tanpuras with independent pan and volume controls, plus a Sur-Peti / Shruti Box\n√ Uses sounds sampled from actual male & female tanpuras for realistic tanpura sound throughout the pitch range\n√ Adjust pitch by name (C#, G, etc.) using pitch up/down buttons\n√ Wide range of pitch from lower A (A2) through upper E (E4) for one and a half octaves of tuning\n√ Suitable for vocal or instrumental music\n√ Fine-tune pitch in cents. The display shows the fine-tune value to allow exact recreation of any pitch\n√ Tempo Control: use the pitch/tempo switch to change the function of the slider in the top section\n√ Play one or two simultaneous tanpuras both controlled by the master pitch controls\n√ Each tanpura's first string can be tuned to Pa, Ma or Ni, or any custom note such as Re, Ga, Dha, etc \n√ Or tune first string to any shruti in the octave using a slider\n√ Each tanpura has its own pan and volume controls to allow precise placement within the stereo image.

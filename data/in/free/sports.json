We feel that the word \"play\" is insufficient to define what gamers do. Their enthusiasm for the game makes the world inside as genuine as the world outside. We feel that technology's responsibility is to immerse them as completely as possible. We vow to form alliances and build communities that will bring gamers closer to and deeper into the games they like.\n\nKhiladi Adda also offers Fantasy Cricket Gaming as an online playground that brings cricket lovers and fantasy gaming players closer to their favorite game. We appreciate the enthusiasm for the game of cricket, therefore we created a FANBATTLE - fantasy cricket with a unique twist!\nWhy waste time in making a team when you can just select player combos?\n\n1. First Deposit: If you are new to the Khiladi Adda app, you shall get a Rs.10 bonus on your signup. Any enrolled user can use 100% of the credit to play games.\n2. Tournament Mode: Tournament mode would consist of varieties of contests. All you need to do is find the best match for your skillset and join the game. You&#39;ll receive room id and passcodes 15 minutes before the match starts.\nThe Khiladi Adda App began its journey seeing the pain points of fantasy game lovers. Too much brainstorming for no assured reward leaves the user hopeless for the most part. Also, with mushrooming and over boarded similar apps to choose from and too much competition on the big fish apps – players are disoriented. KA comes to their rescue! It’s not just any other app! We have been there! And we know what a real gamer set his heart on. Khiladi Adda is just that piece of bite.\nWe are constantly improving our technology and service, and we’d love to hear your feedback.\nPlease leave a review or contact our customer service team at tech@khiladiadda.com."

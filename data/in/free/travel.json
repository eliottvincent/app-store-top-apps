      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 645 cities in 45 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

ArriveCAN no longer collects information on behalf of Public Health Agency of Canada. \n\nArriveCAN still contains Advance CBSA Declaration, which allows you to answer customs and immigration questions up to 72 hours in advance of flying into Canada. It is currently available to international air travellers who enter Canada at selected airports.\n\nBy submitting your customs and immigration information in advance, you will spend less time at a primary inspection kiosk (PIK) or eGate when you arrive at the airport. This contributes to shorter line-ups in arrivals halls.\n\nAt the border, you will be prompted to scan your travel document at a primary inspection device and confirm your identity. Once your identity has been confirmed, your Advance CBSA Declaration will be retrieved from ArriveCAN for you to review and certify. If changes are required, you can edit and update your declaration prior to certification.\n\nUse of the Advance CBSA Declaration feature of ArriveCAN is entirely optional. \n\nPlease refer to the accessibility notice for this app: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/arrivecan.html#accessibility-notice\n\nThis app supports English, French and Spanish (displayed in the language of your device).\n\nFor more information: www.canada.ca/ArriveCAN"

      "label": "\"Where is my Train\" is a unique train app that displays live train status and up-to-date schedules. The app can function offline without needing Internet or GPS. It is also packed with useful features such as destination alarms and a speedometer. It is the highest rated travel app in India. Thank you to all the users who make the app better every day by sharing their feedback with us.\n\nWhy this app is the highest rated train app?\n\nSpotting Train Accurately\n\nGet live train status of Indian Railways anytime, anywhere. When you are traveling on a train, this feature can work without internet or GPS as it uses cell tower information to find the location. You can share current train location with your friends & family via the share feature. You can also set an alarm to wake you up at a fixed time before your railway station arrives.\n\nOffline Train Schedules\n\nThe train app has the Indian Railways timetable offline. You don't have to know train number or names as our Smart search feature allows you to use train source & destination or partial train names even with spelling errors.\n\nCoach Layout and Platform numbers\n\nGet information on coach position and seat/berth layout before you board the train. Also shows platform numbers for boarding and intermediate stations wherever available.\n\nSuper efficient in Battery, Data Usage and App size\n\nThe app is very efficient in battery and data use as key features like finding train locations and schedules can work offline without Internet or GPS. The app-size is relatively small despite having a lot of information offline.\n\n\nSeat Availability and PNR Status\n\nCheck seat availability and PNR status on the official Indian Railways website within the app.\n\nDisclaimer: The app is privately maintained and does not have any affiliation whatsoever to Indian Railways."

      "label": "This app uses the barometric pressure sensor built into all the newer iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch Models sold after 2016 with few exceptions. You need one of these newer devices to use this App. See below which older iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch without this sensor are not supported!\n\nThis App features a Barometer for weather, an Altimeter for outdoor activities, a barometric Trend and a Notification Center Widget.\n\nEven without the optional In-App-Purchase this is a fully functional Barometer with absolutely no draw-backs and all important features accessible. Always without ads! (See \"Pro Features\" at the end). No internet connection required, no data transmitted - runs on your device only!\n\nKeep an eye on the barometric pressure and be your own weather forecast! This little app uses only GPS (optional) and the new barometric pressure sensor to calculate the barometric pressure used in weather forecasts. The new iPhones have a barometric pressure sensor built in so this app works completely without internet. The handy marker helps you keep track of changes in the barometric pressure and let's you predict weather changes! Please realize, that a single barometric pressure reading is not enough to tell the current weather situation but the barometric pressure and its change over time is a very good indicator for weather changes!\n\nNow you can also see the trend in barometric pressure with graph charts displaying the measurements taken during the last 30 days! (6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d)\n\nThe Altimeter helps you track your altitude changes based on the change of pressure. Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for checking how high up the mountain you have climbed (works for other activities too). The App does not use GPS for the Altimeter.\n\nPlease Note that on older devices such as the 4S, 5, 5S and 5C as well as on any iPod Touch and iPad Models older than iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4 as well as the Apple Watch 1 and 2, this app will not be able to read barometric pressure values and not display any useful information. The first generation 4-inch iPhone SE is not supported - the new SE (2020) is!\n\nAll basic features, the Barometer, the Altimeter, the Trend and the Widget are completely free to use for everyone and are fully functional at maximum accuracy available. No ads!\nThe only features with restricted access via In-App-Purchase are listed at the end under \"Pro Features\". Those are nice to have features for power users or those that want to show their support for the App!\n\nFeatures (free for everyone)\n- Barometer for weather\n- Altimeter for outdoor activities\n- HomeScreen Widget (iOS 14 and newer)\n- Today-View Widget (all Versions)\n- Watch App\n- Up to 30d trend visualised with graphs\n- Interactive timeline on the trend graphs\n- No internet connection required since the sensor is built into the new iPhones and iPads\n- Supports 6 different pressure units\n- Support for 2 different altitude units\n- Analog Barometer with support for all 6 units\n- Configurable \"displayed accuracy\" / number of decimals\n- Supports setting a custom marker so you can track changes in barometric pressure\n- Manual altitude setting or automatic altitude updates based on GPS for the Barometer.\n- GPS Correction. In case your GPS seems to always be 'off' a little you can now fix this easily.\n- Portrait and Landscape support\n- No ads! No data collection beyond your device (history and settings). No web communication at all.\n\nPro Features (one time In-App Purchase required)\n- Change the Barometer Face\n- Fishing Barometer\n- Two scales on the Barometer\n- Data export in CSV Format"

The change in the weather condition has worsened air quality.\n\n• Air is the Earth's atmosphere. Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear gas in which living things live and breathe. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no colour or smell. It has mass and weight, because it is matter. The weight of air creates atmospheric pressure. There is no air in outer space. \n• Air is a mixture of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and very small amounts of other gases.\n• Air can be polluted by some gases (such as carbon monoxide), smoke, and ash. This air pollution causes various problems including smog, acid rain and global warming. It can damage people's health.\n• The Air Quality data sources varies depending on the cities.\n\n\n\nPLACES:\n- Store favourite places to find out Air Quality Info easily.\n- Easy to navigate to the bookmarked places and find pollution level instantly.\n\n\nMAP: \n- You can check all the near by City’s Air Quality Index on Map\n- Providing the Air Quality info city wise.\n- Plan your visit based on the good AQI for the specific city.\n\n\nWEATHER:\n- Show weather conditions for the current place.\n- Show sunrise and sunset time.\n\n\nNEWS:\n- Get up to date with latest Air Quality Data and Air Pollution news using Google News.\n- The latest News provides option for planning the journey for any new places based on pollution levels.\n\n\nAIR QUALITY INDEX CHART: \n- You can check the range of quality indexes and info about Index is good or bad\n- Distinguish between different indexes with color so the user can easily understand the level of pollution.\n\n\nCOUNTRY LIST: \n- You can check the country list and select your city to get the AQI info\n- Providing the country name and flag so easily identify and fid the top cities for the selected country.\n\n\nProviding below gases information in Air using this app: - CO (Carbon Oxide) \n- NO2 (Nitrogen dioxide)\n- O3 (Ozon)\n- PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter)\n- PM25 (particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter)\n- SO2 (Sulfer dioxide)\n- T \n- W\n- WG \n- H (Hydrogen)\n- DEW (Hydrocarbon Dew)\n\n\n\nAQI LEVELS DEFINITION:\n\n• Green: AQI (0 - 50) | Good\nAir quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk\n\n• Yellow: AQI\t(51 -100) | Moderate\nAir quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.\n\n• Orange: AQI\t(101-150) | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\nMembers of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected.\n\n• Red: AQI (151-200) | Unhealthy\nEveryone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects\n\n• Purple: AQI (201-300)\t| Very Unhealthy\nHealth warnings of emergency conditions.

      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Lite provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Lite is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. There are many settings for units and format of METAR/TAF available.\n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes basic airport data like sunrise/sunset, twilight times, timezones etc. \n\nAeroWeather Lite offers built-in groups for nearby stations, today widget (pre iOS 14), and earthquakes. Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view.\n\nMETAR alert notifications** is an helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with the following criteria: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility, and ceiling (BKN and OVC). Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when wind is greater/equal 10 kts, flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data comes primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. The pictures will be available to all other pilots (on the map or within an airport detail view) helping them to get a better idea about local conditions. AeroPix should be especially helpful when there's no or insufficient webcam coverage.\n\nThere's also an iMessage app included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. In order to keep AeroWeather Lite free we added a small ad banner at the bottom of the screen. Consider getting AeroWeather Pro, subscribe the additional features**, or remove the ad banner through one-time unlock* to have an ad-free app.\n\n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - METAR/TAF from ADS-B receiver thru GDL 90 protocol (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nWhen using AeroWeather Lite also the following features are enabled:\n - Remove ad banner\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/"

Knowing when sun protection is recommended wherever you are in the world gives you confidence to enjoy the sun safely, minimizing the risk of skin damage which can lead to cancer. \nThe SunSmart Global UV app takes the guesswork out of being safe in the sun with daily sun protection times sent to your phone along with simple advice for protecting your skin.\nWhat are sun protection times?\nSun protection times are linked to the UV Index and are advised when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above. This is consistent with the WHO UV Index guidance and has been determined as the level at which damage to the skin is likely to occur more quickly.\nThe app will advise you that sun protection is required during specific times when the UV is forecast to be 3 and above so that you can adequately protect your skin.\nHow is it different to other UV apps?\nIt is the only UV app that has the backing and credibility of the World Meteorological Organization making it a truly trusted and reliable source.\nUnlike other apps, the SunSmart Global UV app is designed to simply inform users when sun protection is required and when it is not. \nWhat are the key features?\n\n-         daily UV levels for the local area including sun protection times\n-        5-day forecast including UV and weather forecast\n-        access to the forecast UV and sun protection times anywhere in the world"

Never wonder when the sun will set or rise again!\n\nTracking the sun and moon is something people have done for thousands of years but it's never been easier than it is today with Sundial. Sundial puts solar and lunar information into the palm of your hand and, thanks to the Apple Watch app, onto your wrist as well!\n\nSundial is an app designed to give everyone access to the sun and moon in ways they don't normally have it.

Sundial is an app for anyone who just needs to know when it'll get light and dark.\n\nSundial provides a one-of-a-kind display of the sun and moon's rise and set cycle over the 24-hour day. As the seasons change, the yellow Òsun is outÓ arc informs you of the precious daylight hours, shrinking during winter months and expanding as summer approaches. The white inner arc represents when the moon is visible in the sky. Civil, nautical, and astronomical twilights are also shown on the solar dial in shades of blue.\n\nCreate alerts for one of 24 different solar and lunar events and Sundial will tell you about them Ð without you ever having to open the app.\n\nThe 24 events that support notifications include:\n\n- Sunrise, solar mid-morning, solar noon, solar mid-afternoon, sunset, and solar midnight\n- Civil twilight (dawn/dusk), nautical twilight, and astronomical twilight\n- Moonrise, lunar noon, moonset, and lunar midnight\n- Moon phases: full moon, new moon, first quarter moon, and last quarter moon\n- Astronomical seasons: March equinox, June solstice, September equinox, and December solstice\n\nAll notifications can be customized to alert you minutes, hours, and even days before an event takes place.

      "label": "Trying to avoid walking straight into a rainstorm when you go out? Check our rain radar and rain graph before you leave so you never have to get drenched!\n\t\nDe Buienradar app starts with the 3 hour or the 24 hour rain radar forecast. The rain radar image will show you whether it is going to rain in the next upcoming hours or even the next day. Below the radar is the rain graph. In this graph you can see exactly when it is going to rain and how much rainfall is predicted (in millimeters). If you prefer an even more detailed image of your city or town you can press the magnifying glass icon to zoom in.\n\nThe Buienradar app is suitable for iPhone and iPad. Via the handy widgets (with rain graph for your current location) you can quickly see on your today's screen whether it will rain soon without opening the app. The widget is now also visible with 3D touch: press the Buienradar app icon a little harder in your app overview to make the widget appear.\n\nBesides the Buienradar you can also find other radars and maps:\n- Drizzle\n- Sun \n- NL Satellite images\n- Storm\n- Pollen (hay fever)\n- Sun (UV)\n- Mosquitos\n- BBQ\n- Temperature\n- Feeling temperature\n- Wind\n- Fog\n- Snow\n- EU Buienradar (rain radar)\n- EU Satellite images\n\nYou can find personalized weather info in the table “Komende uren in” (Next 8 hours weather prediction) for your favorite location (even abroad!) like hour-to-hour predictions for: temperature, feeling temperature, the number of millimeters of rain per hour, the chance of rain and wind force (in Beaufort).\n\nBesides thunderstorm, snow, sun, wind and temperature maps we also offer wind chill, ground temperature, sun intensity, air pressure, gusts, visibility and humidity data, together with the exact times of sunrise and sunset for your location.\n\nWe also offer seasonal radar maps. In the summer, for example, you can use our pollen and mosquito radars in order to receive a timely notification when it is wise to hang up your mosquito net. In the winter you can use our snowradar, which informs you about winter precipitation, but we also offer a map especially for ground temperature which warns you about night frost.\n\nIn the “14-daagse” tab (14 day forecast) you will find the weather forecast (in a graph) for the next 14 days. You can also see a detailed list view when you click on the tab “Lijst”. This list offers an hourly forecast for the next 7 days and a daily average for the second week.\n\nIn the “Meldingen” tab you can create your own rain alert (free push notification) customized to your daily time schedule and favorite locations so you will never be unprepared for rain or a storm.\n\nIf you don't want to see ads, we also offer the Buienradar Plus plan for €3,49 per year. You can find this easily in “Instellingen” (“Settings”) and then press “Neem Buienradar Plus” (Get Buienradar Plus).\n\nOur Terms of Use can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/gebruikers-voorwaarden.html\n\nOur Privacy statement can be found here:\nhttps://privacy.rtl.nl/privacy-statement.html\n\nWe are continuously improving the Buienradar app. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve or if you have any questions, you can always reach out to us by using the feedback form in the app or by sending us an e-mail via appsupport@buienradar.nl.

Details show the index and 6 major pollutants being tracked along with health advisory for the same. \n\nYou can get alerts from the app.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Air quality index.\n- Air quality index by city\n- Air quality index data for - 10,000 stations in 800 major cities from 70 countries\n-Weather\n- Monitoring of 6 key Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide\n- Complete Health Index chart available for reference\n- Trusted Air Quality Data from AQICN http://aqicn.org\n- Automatically fetch and display local Air Quality and Air Pollution data as a pollution meter from the nearest reporting station using your phone's GPS location.\n- Data used for air quality index includes ground-level ozone, particulate matter, pm10, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitric oxide, and nitrogen dioxide. \n- Easy to understand pollution meter.\n- Search Air Pollution and Air Quality data for any location by City name.\n- Contains Air Pollution / Air Quality data for over 60 countries including in over 60 countries including Canada, United States Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Turkey and India.\n- Display up to date Air Quality Index (AQI) data for the selected location. \n- Displays basic weather metrics for a selected location such as: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind vector (wind speed, wind direction).\n- Maintains a list of recently searched locations for easy look up and Air Quality reference.\n\nThe air quality index is based on the five 'criteria' pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act:\n\n• ground-level ozone\n• particulate matter\n• carbon monoxide\n• sulphur dioxide\n• nitrogen dioxide\n• CO (Carbon Oxide) \n• NO2 (Nitrogen dioxide)\n• O3 (Ozon)\n• PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter)\n• PM25 (particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter)\n• SO2 (Sulfer dioxide)\n• T \n• W\n• WG \n• H (Hydrogen)\n• DEW (Hydrocarbon Dew)\n\nOften the weather can be the cause of air pollution. In cold winter nights without wind, there is a higher possibility the air quality to worsen due to temperature inversion.\nParticulate matter is removed primarily by rainfall. If the pollution level of the air is moderate to high and it starts raining, about 60 minutes are needed to see a difference. This is why weather can cause and solve the air pollution problem.\n\nThis air quality index app is great for anyone concerned about air quality, air pollution, and weather conditions in countries such as India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Pakistan , United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Czech Republic, India, Singapore, South Africa, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and air quality in their general vicinity especially in heavily polluted regions like those around Beijing and eastern China,India, New Delhi.\n\nVIP MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS are now available!\n\nJoin in VIP Membership, you can get the paid functions below:\n• Ads will not appear inside the app \n• Different types of pollution maps\n• Apple Watch support\n• Specific notifications for your location\n\nNote: Air Quality offers two auto-renewing subscription options: $0.99 one month, $ 4,99 six months, $8,99 one year.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here -\nhttps://alejandro99aru.wixsite.com/misitio/terms-conditions\n\nRead more about our privacy policy here - \nhttps://alejandro99aru.wixsite.com/misitio/privacy-policy"

      "label": "Climate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.\n\nA region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere.\n\nThe climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.\n\nPaleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming. Global warming results in redistributions."

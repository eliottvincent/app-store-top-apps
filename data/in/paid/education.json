Interaction between Propofol and opioids is implemented. An exceptional feature is the IVassist mode that will calculate a manual dosing scheme  to obtain  and change a target blood or effect site concentration with adjustable precision. This will allow to show an example of a TCI like  administration of drugs and Pk models that are not yet available in TCI systems and evaluate that model.

The prodigal Prada gal spent $1500 on a pair of Prada boots. Get it? :)\n\nThe app's smart spaced repetition system shows you words when you need to review them to make your GRE vocabulary studying more efficient and effective.

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "Every musician should work on Ear Training (or Aural Training) and Interval Ear Training is a very important element of ear training. To put it very simply, you will learn to recognise the relationship between two notes (by distance), when they are played together or apart!\n\nThere are two types of interval listening, harmonic and melodic. In harmonic intervals the notes are played at the same time and in melodic the notes are played one after the other. Easy to remember: Melodic Intervals make melody, Harmonic Intervals make harmony!\n\nMany of you will probably want to understand how the names are found and how to work out the interval note names in every key. For this info you probably want to check out my ebook Practical Music Theory (available from justinguitar.com) which will explain all the theory related to this.\n\nThis app deals specifically with Interval Ear Training, both melodic and harmonic. It will start very easy and gradually get harder as you get more correct and can pass each stage. You can choose from Piano or Guitar Input for your answers, and you can chose to hear the notes and guitar or piano. Personally, I'd recommend getting used to both. In \"Training Mode\" you can select specific intervals to work on if you are struggling with just specific intervals or types of interval.\n\nI'm sure you'll find this app very helpful, all you need to add is practice time! \n\nBest wishes, Justin"

Here you train yourself in recognizing other people's behaviour patterns, which will be of great benefit in all future meetings. For example, how do you meet an introvert if you are an extrovert yourself? In what way can you separate factual issues from personal ones? How do you adapt more quickly to people around you and get what you want? You find the answers here. With the help of Surrounded by idiots, all interaction with others becomes both smoother and easier.\n\nThe app contains many areas of knowledge about different behaviours. You regularly test your skills through different types of quizzes and through concrete problem solving of different relationship challenges. In just a few minutes you can also do a simplified behavioural analysis of both yourself and others. Then you receive a recommendation on which strategy you should use towards different individuals. It cannot be more simple!\n\nThe content is easily accessible and entertaining, at the same time as you build real skills around how to handle everyone you meet from now on.\n\nSurrounded by idiots is for both you who are interested in yourself and your own personal development, and for you who are curious about how other people work - and why. Have you ever had trouble understanding people around you? Are you tired of poor communication and misunderstandings? Are you looking for tools to easier get along with others? Then this is the app for you.\n\nThe biggest benefit is that from day one you will increase your social skills. You will understand people around you in a completely different way. Your various interactions with people you meet will be seen in a whole new light. The amount of unnecessary conflicts will decrease, and you will more easily understand both your partner and – why not your boss. And, not least, they will understand you.\n\nThe app costs no more than a lunch but contains insights you will benefit from for years.\nIt is based on the best-selling book Surrounded by Idiots. And builds on the worldwide model with the four colours: red, yellow, green and blue. The fundamentals can be traced all the way back to Carl Jung."

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong. Water suddenly bursts from a pipe, a builder falls into a hole or the wind blows the bricks away because the cement wasn’t dry yet.\n\nLittle Builders is the first 3D app for children aged 2-6 years that want to explore the world of being a real little builder. Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

      "label": "Letter Quiz is the best way to learn the English Alphabet with over 10,000 copies being purchased by schools. Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.\n\n- What People Are Saying:\n\"I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.\"\n\n\"My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.\"\n\n\nFour great games to develop your skills:\n\n- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters\nThe uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.\n\n- Letter Identification to test knowledge\nMultiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.\n\n- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters\nThe top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.\n\n- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting\nEach letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter.

There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug!

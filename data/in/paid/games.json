Sven, as we like to call him, can use animals to aid his escape from an icey end. Each of the hillside animals have different attributes to make a speedier escape. Penguins glide further, Yetis are tougher, Eagles soar to great heights, each of these can provide useful advantage for Sven. Sometimes on the slopes Sven can find fast Snowmobiles which can ferry multiple animals a maintain a very high top speed.\n\nStaying ahead of the avalanche has its advantages and perks. Completing objectives can 'level up' Sven  and increase his score multiplier. Riding animals, performing backflips add to the score and with an increased score multiplier Sven will rocketing up the highscore table with ease."

By constantly intertwining and replacing each other, they maintain balance. The main character named OVO was born of these two halves and has the ability to switch between them. OVO travels through the metaphorical world, overcoming dangers and collecting mysterious symbols. These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.\n\nFeatures:\n■\tFlow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black—upward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being carried by a flow.\n\n■\tFascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions.\n\n■\tDesign without words. There is almost no text in the game and the story is told through gameplay and visuals.\n\n■\tMeditative ambient soundtrack by Brokenkites."

With this we should consign the term “interactive movie” to history’s dustbin, because movies can’t dream of offering audiences a narrative structure as intimate and involving as this: they’re just moving pictures. Her Story points to the future\" 5/5, The Guardian\n\nHer Story is the critically acclaimed mystery game from Sam Barlow. Playing like an interactive true crime documentary, the game lets you go hands on with a police database full of live action video footage. It stars Viva Seifert, actress and one half of the band Joe Gideon and the Shark.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nHer Story sits you in front of a mothballed desktop computer and logs you into a police database. Search through hundreds of video clips that cover seven interviews from 1994 in which a British woman is interviewed about her missing husband. Explore the database by typing search terms, watch the clips where she speaks those words and piece together her story.\n\n\"Her Story is a beautiful amalgam of the cinema and video game formats... a remarkable achievement...\" 90, The Washington Post\n\n\"Profound, gripping live-action drama… sure to be discussed for years to come\" 5/5, Digital Spy\n\nUnlike anything you've played before, Her Story is an involving and moving experience. One that asks you to listen."

You can now even design custom interiors.\n\n- Set product menus and pricing wisely to compete with neighboring coffee shops. You can now also develop brand-new products.\n\n- Conduct store marketing to drive traffic while minimizing the cost. You now have more marketing campaigns.\n\n- Hire store staff and keep them working hard and happy. Their services will determine your store's popularity. You can now even hire a store manager to delegate many of daily store operations.\n\n- Store staff and customers cause many accidents every week. You deal with it one by one or delegate them to store managers.\n\n- Borrow money from banks if you need cash. Watch out the interest rates, though, now that every country has its own GDP growth and bank policy rate.\n\n- As the number of stores grows, store management gets complex. Open offices, hire white-collar workers and create functional departments: Human Resource, Finance, Products, Marketing, Engineering, Executive, and Investment.\n\n- Through the HR division, provides training, recreations, compensations and benefits to employees.\n\n- The Finance now has a cash flow statement, in addition to income statement and balance sheet.

      "label": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens."

If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\r\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\r\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\r\n\r\nWe will update and improve Real Drift constantly. Please rate and give your feedback for further improvement of the game.\r\nFOLLOW US\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Real-Drift/788082697884714"

      "label": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

While the original got rave reviews for its stylized manga graphics and quick, bloody gameplay, Samurai II delivers even more action and an intuitive new control scheme.\n\nSlideToPlay.com - 4/4\nIpadarena.com - 10/10\nAppSpy.com - 5/5\nMacWorld.com - 4.5/5\nAppAdvice.com - 4.5/5\nGamezebo.com - 4.5/5\nTouchreviews.net - 4.5/5\nNineoverten.com - 4.5/5\nifanzine 4.5/5\nGamerstemple.com - 90/100\nPixeljumpers.com - 9/10\nPocketGamer.co.uk 8/10 \n\n\nSamurai: Way of the Warrior was featured in Best Games of 2009 by Apple – Samurai II is a true successor, aided by over a year of focused development. Overall production values and vicious action put Samurai II on par with console 3D brawlers. Screenshots don’t do Samurai II justice – the fluid action has to be seen running at 60 frames per second on the Retina display or popping off the iPad screen.\n\nBut looks alone won’t carry a game – the developers listened to fan feedback and improved gameplay throughout. With a new virtual d-pad, dynamic camera, environmental puzzles, traps, and vicious new enemies, Samurai II is brand new experience for hack ‘n’ slash gamers on the go. \n\nSamurai II sends Daisuke on a quest for revenge across the war-scorched countryside. From a seafaring village to a flying fortress to the legendary Isle of the Dead, the samurai will stop at nothing to hunt down his arch-enemy Orochi. Will he get his Vengeance?\n\nFEATURES:\n* Intuitive virtual joystick ensures you’re slicing up baddies, not swiping the screen.\n\n* Dynamic camera finds the best perspective for each encounter, adding variety while keeping focused on the action.\n\n* Tense, quick and gory battle sequences!\n- Battle hordes of on-screen enemies wielding new weapons and sporting unique abilities.\n- Stay nimble and plan your attacks – roll out of harm’s way and eliminate ranged enemies like the Samurai Archer before they can strike.\n* Improved gameplay includes new features.\n-   Solve environmental puzzles, avoid dangerous traps, and discover useful items.\n- The fight is on - not to worry, the combat never takes a back seat to platforming or fetch-quests.\n\n* RPG elements reward skilled players – upgrade the Samurai’s health, buy new attack combos and upgrade them to devastating levels.\n\n* Between levels, gorgeous anime-style comic panels tell the samurai’s tale with original hand-drawn artwork.\n\n* New survival mode pits the samurai against waves of enemies, giving hardcore players a score-attack mode to hone their skills. Two games in one!\n\n* Advanced AI system on par with console games. Goal Oriented Action Planning architecture is used in many PC and console games.\n\n* Apple Game Center support, including Leaderboards and Achievements. \n\n*Support iCloud to transfer save between various devices\n\n*Support MFI Controllers (Gamepads)\n\n* Original soundtrack – in classic samurai movie style, soft music builds with the heat of battle.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks To : ImNoSuperMan, PureSkill, Squarezero, Rocco, eggzbacon, Prab"

Wage war upon neighboring states to slow their growth, and build spectacular pagodas to increase your own prestige. How will your reign be remembered?\n\nBalance in All Things\nExpand your civilization by placing tiles that represent the five facets of a thriving kingdom:\nGovernors - Keep the peace and quell revolts with a strong civic leadership!\nSoldiers - Defend your growing empire -- or wage war upon your neighbors!\nFarmers - Cultivate the banks of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers!\nTraders - Acquire the resources your people need to prosper!\nArtisans - Shape the culture of your dynasty and inspire your citizens!\nYour legacy will be judged by your weakest category, so a wise leader must maintain harmony to achieve victory!\n\n\nPraise for the physical board game:\n\"It's all very strategic as you build kingdoms and decide the best moment to attack. The game is very intense. It's delicious stress.\" - The Dice Tower\n\n\"Yellow & Yangtze is just awesome. Because you're trying to get a balance of all different colors, it's not just a tug-of-war back-and-forth. There's sort of this circular cyle of motion of different colors that people are going for, and it really makes the game super enjoyable. Overall, this game is amazing.\" - Board Game Geek\n\n\"An exceptional thematic work.

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

Playing through campaigns unlocks more elements to appear in the game.\n* Modes & modifiers: A variety of game modes, guilds, game modifiers, and challenges make each playthrough unique. \n\nGameplay\nEach round, you get to place a tile on the isle for free.

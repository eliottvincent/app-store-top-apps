The game departs its familiar desert setting and delves into the depths of cities infested by zombies. \n\nMULTI-TIERED LEVELS:\nLevels are now multi-tiered! Drive across decayed highway overpasses, via underground tunnels, or smash through epic zombie filled factories. Whichever path you choose to take, you won't be able to escape the zombie hordes - your only choice is to smash through them!\n\nBUILD A ZOMBIE-SLAUGHTERING MACHINE\nUnlock and upgrade 10 different vehicles, including a sports car, a fire truck, and even an ice-cream van. Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.\n\nDESTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES\nVehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.\n\nMORE ZOMBIES. MORE DESTRUCTION. MORE MAYHEM.\nWhat are you waiting for?

Each of the vehicles in the game has it's own specifications and engine sounds. Well detailed body and dashboard create the effect of full presence and realism.\n\nThe game offers four unique tracks with different weather conditions. Drive on scenic country road dotted with cherry blossoms, or go for a ride in the Japanese city, which is particularly beautiful at night, thanks to the traditional Japanese lanterns, hanging over the road. If you are a real extreme racer, you should drive on winter track with dangerous icy road. You can choose the starting time of the day, that will change dynamically.\n\nStart the engine, press down on the gas and chase as quickly as possible. Earn points by overtaking traffic cars, you need them to open the new vehicles, modes and other features of the game.\n\n  This racing simulator gives you the ability to choose the style of driving that can be tranquil and safe or extremely racing. The abundance of settings allows you to customize a level of car physics realism, from arcade and simple to the most realistic, as in the difficult racing simulator in which you will need to show your driving skills. \n\n Record your gameplay videos and share them to your friends in social networks with Everyplay Service. You can edit recorded video replays and comment them using the camera and microphone on your device. \n\n Features: \n- No Ads;\n- 20000 bonus points;\n- Game progress synchronization;\n- Modern beautiful graphics;\n - Realistic car physics; \n- Change the time of day in real-time; \n- Qualitatively modeled Japan cars; \n- 4 tracks with different weather conditions; \n- First person view / interior camera. \n\n Warning! This game is quite realistic, but it is not designed to teach you how to street racing. Be careful and responsible when you're driving real car. Enjoy virtual racing in heavy car traffic, but please observe the traffic rules and be careful on real roads."

If you change drift direction, points are added to Total Points Indicator (located in the top left of the screen) and reset. If points reach every multiple of 2000 again, Drift Combo is increased by 1 again. This works only if you keep drifting without too long interruptions between one drift and the other (less than 1 second), otherwise Drift Combo multiplier will be reset to 1.\r\nProximity multiplier is increased when you drift with the back of the car near a wall (less than 1.5 meters) proportionally to closeness. You'll notice this bonus with a slow motion effect and a text showing the multiplier factor.\r\nIf you hit anything you'll lose your partial points and all multipliers.\r\n\r\nWe will update and improve Real Drift constantly. Please rate and give your feedback for further improvement of the game.\r\nFOLLOW US\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Real-Drift/788082697884714"

Love it\"\n\nWelcome to Ski Safari!\n\nSki Safari is where Animals, Avalanches and Action come together to create a new casual gameplay experience.\n\nOur deep sleeping hero has to stay ahead of a relentless avalanche that threatens the local mountainsides. Sven, as we like to call him, can use animals to aid his escape from an icey end. Each of the hillside animals have different attributes to make a speedier escape. Penguins glide further, Yetis are tougher, Eagles soar to great heights, each of these can provide useful advantage for Sven. Sometimes on the slopes Sven can find fast Snowmobiles which can ferry multiple animals a maintain a very high top speed.\n\nStaying ahead of the avalanche has its advantages and perks. Completing objectives can 'level up' Sven  and increase his score multiplier. Riding animals, performing backflips add to the score and with an increased score multiplier Sven will rocketing up the highscore table with ease."

Play 40 different levels, and build bridges over deep valleys, canals, and rivers. Stress tests reveal whether the bridge you build can withstand the daily stress of continual use from cars, trucks and, more recently, super-heavy tank trucks.\n\nYou can choose from a range of materials for each individual bridge, such as wood, steel, cables, or concrete pillars. Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realise your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system! \n\nAwesome Add-Ons: SlopeMania & Trains\n\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes! The 24 tricky, never-before-seen levels will have you using sloping lanes to overcome the massive height differences.

      "label": "40% OFF SALE to celebrate the launch of MUL.MASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL!!!\n\nFlame kick werewolves, perform thrilling acrobatic stunts, and run a trillion dollar mining company in Riverman Media’s combat-action masterpiece! \n\n#2 Best-reviewed iOS game of 2015 - Metacritic.com\n\nFrom the creators of the award-winning “Pizza Vs. Skeletons” comes The Executive: a fast-paced, cinematic, martial arts action game designed from the ground up for iPhone and iPad. You are the CEO of a company that has been infiltrated by werewolves, and it’s your job to save your employees, and eventually the entire city, from their dastardly schemes.\n\nOUR PROMISE TO YOU: No ads. No getting suckered into buying more stuff later. The whole game, for one price, for all updates, forever.\n\nThe Executive combines a high-speed combat system, timing-based running and platforming, 120 hand-crafted levels, a full inventory of moves and upgrades, and a simple mining company simulation for earning money, all into one cohesive experience. The fighting engine evokes a cross between Street Fighter II and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, with controls designed from scratch to be ideal for touch screens. The platforming (or “stunt”) segments require precise timing, similar to Elite Beat Agents but with an emphasis on visual timing instead of musical rhythm. Both of these mechanics are brought together by the SP bar, which allows you to execute gesture-based special moves like flame kicks, health restoration, and even morphing your character’s arm into a silver spike to impale foes.\n\nThe Executive uses Riverman Media’s proprietary animation system to bring to life its large, hand-drawn 2D sprites with an unprecedented amount of smoothness and detail. The Executive represents the pinnacle of Riverman Media’s research and development into new 2D graphics technology.\n\nFEATURES\n\n+ 120 levels, hand-crafted one pixel at a time. No randomly generated endless filler.\n+ Dozens of abilities and skills to learn\n+ Battle enemies and execute stunts in every level\n+ Over 50 unique enemies, each with their own intelligence, strengths, and weaknesses\n+ Invest in your mining company and earn money continuously\n+ 12 Menacing bosses that will require your strategy and skill to defeat\n+ Universal App: purchase it once, play forever on iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch\n+ 12 Challenging achievements\n+ High-definition “Retina” graphics for all supported devices, Retina HD graphics on iPhone 6+\n+ iCloud support: touch the Book icon from the main menu to transfer progress between devices!\n\nNot ready to buy? Try the first 10 levels in the FREE version! Once you're ready to upgrade to this version, your progress will transfer over automatically.\n\n――――――――――\nRiverman Media is two brothers who have dedicated their lives to the art of 2D game making\n――――――――――\n\n* Street Fighter 2, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and Elite Beat Agents are not affiliated with Riverman Media or The Executive."

      "label": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens."

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

Hack RUN® is a game which uses 'old school' command prompts (like DOS or UNIX) that simulate a real operating system. Learn the commands of each system to help you navigate through your adventure.\n\nAs you hack into their systems, you will learn about the organization and the people who work there. Read files and emails to find clues and riddles which will give you access to more accounts. Data found on their systems will help you learn about the motives of the organization, and how dark their plans can get. You may also discover dirty little secrets about the employees as well.\n\nHacking into new accounts or discovering key information will increase your skill level. As you achieve your goals, you will move closer and closer to the final achievement; over 60 levels deep!\n\nIt's time for a Hack RUN!\n\nUse the Apple TV companion app to enhance your game on the big screen!\n\nApple Watch support! Now you can display the recent contents of the terminal on your watch, view your achievements and view tips and help.\n\nGAME CENTER SUPPORT: Earn achievements and compare your leaderboard score against other players.\n\nStuck on a level? Just use the 'hint' or 'answer' commands to help you along.\n\nMake sure to play all FIVE games in this series! Play 'Hack RUN 2 - Hack ZERO', 'Hack Time', 'Hack NET' and 'Hack WATCH' after you complete this game!\n\nGreat news! Hack RUN® has been featured in the App Store! We are thrilled Apple has given us this honor, and we hope you enjoy it as much as they do! \n\n\"Great fun! - I just finished Hack RUN, what a great game! I'm a big fan of interactive fiction and this is a wonderful example of how the genre can be expanded and still be current.\"\n \n\"BRILLIANT - This game is innovative, clever and a HUGE breath of fresh air...\"\n\n\"This is AWESOME!!! - This game us so cool that I stopped texting my girlfriend to play it haha :P\"\n\nHack RUN® is a game.

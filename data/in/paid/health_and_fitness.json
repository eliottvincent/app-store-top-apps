I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

This high-intensity training with little rest results in higher daily metabolism and is the equivalent of working out for over an hour - for only slightly longer than 7 minutes. \n\nThe best part?

      "label": "Grapefruit is an app for managing your mental health. Write your journal, track your habits and emotions, and use the unique mood rating system to tie everything together. You then get back real data on your mental health that you can use to make your life a well-oiled smile factory.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. Write In Your Journal\n\nOne of the best things you can do for your mental health is keep a journal. They help you understand your thoughts, reduce stress, and many other benefits. So Grapefruit is centered around that. You'll see instant benefits from just journaling alone, but to get the most out of it, you can go deeper.\n\n2. Track Your Feelings (And Whatever Else)\n\nSay you're struggling with a particular emotion (e.g. depression, or anger) and trying to identify the triggers. Wouldn't it be helpful to read back your journal for just the days when you felt that emotion? That's one way our emotion tracking can help. But what about two emotions? What happened on days when you were sad and angry? You can look at those days as well. Though ... maybe you won't want to.\n\n3. Review Your Data\n\nDo you know how often you have a good day? That’s one of the many things Grapefruit will show you. Why? Because it’s so much easier to weather the storms when you know exactly when the sun is coming. Now, how about days of the week? Or most common emotions? When you rate your days and track a few things, the results can be really impactful.\n\n4. Make It Your Own\n\nThere are as many ways to use it as there are people! Add questions that are specific to your own unique experience. Change the emotions/feelings list to reflect how you describe your feelings, or replace it entirely with a list of different cheeses if you want.\n\nIt's your journey, we're just here to help!\n\n-----\n\nSome of our favourite quotes:\n\n\"This is a great app and it is truly making a difference in my life! I really love it and now I can't imagine a day without rating it here.\"\n\n\"I thought my life was filled with bad days. I'm discovering that I'm not having as many bad days as I thought. I'm already starting to have a more positive outlook on life.\""

      "label": "The next big trend in bio-hacking is understanding the relationships between different metrics. NatureBeat integrates and correlates data from popular fitness platforms like MapMyFitness, Fitbit and Withings. \n\nBy analyzing HRV and Stress along with additional data, NatureBeat provides a deeper dive into health and provides insight into what activities you engage in that effect the health metrics you care about.\n\nIMPORTANT: NatureBeat requires external hardware:\nA tested Bluetooth Low Energy Heart Rate Monitors.  While other manufacturers wrist worn devices work well for heart rate, their wrist worn heart rate monitors are not accurate enough for HRV and so are not supported. They can be used for Food Sensitivity test.\n\nNatureBeat can be used with IOS 8 and newer.  iPhone 5 and newer, iPad 3 and newer, iPad Mini and newer, iPod touch 5.  \n\n•Please visit www.BeatHealthy.com for a list of compatible Heart Rate Monitors, noting that the Wahoo and 60Beat dongles are not supported\n\nNatureBeat has four main components:\n•Monitor Stress\n•HRV for Training\n•Food Sensitivity\n•Data Correlation\n\nMonitor Stress: \nWith NatureBeat, you can see your stress levels in real time, giving you the ability to take action to reduce stress. If your chosen stress threshold is reached, NatureBeat’s Relax screen prompts you with a deep breathing screen that includes calming images.\n\nNEW: Checkup mode is a 3 minute countdown ideally suited for use with the Zoom device. Checkup can be run with any compatible BTLE heart rate monitor chest strap too. The three minute session allows the Zoom user to accurately assess stress and power levels anytime during the day.\n\n•Stats: The stats screen more widely referred to as the “geek” screen, shows all the metrics being measured. If using the HealthPatch, the user can view the additional provided metrics.\n•Graph: The graph screen shows a real-time building graph of your heart rate from RR Intervals. Turning the phone 90 degrees counter-clockwise will bring up the graph in landscape. \n•Export RR Intervals: SweetBeat provides RR interval export capability. \n\nHRV For Training: \nIn competitive sports, improved performance is often affected by alternating periods of intensive training with periods of relative rest. NatureBeat measures HRV, an objective measure of your body’s response to each workout and provides training recommendations based on the morning reading. \n\nFood Sensitivity Test: \nIf you are sensitive to certain foods, you may not experience symptoms, though your body reacts by elevating your heart rate after eating an offending food. Low level food sensitivities may contribute to inflammation. This inflammation tells the body to hang onto stored fat to combat whatever stress caused the hormonal release. NatureBeat measures your pulse three times after eating and assigns either a “X” (sensitive) or a green checkmark (not sensitive).  \n\nCorrelation: \nThe correlation screen uses a patent pending algorithm to correlate all of the data the user has shared with NatureBeat. This data will come from the app itself and any other apps or devices the user has authorized (Fitbit, Withings, and/or MapMyFitness). \n\nThe correlation feature turns your data into useful information and provides insight into what combination of activities lead to desired HRV, stress or weight, giving you the knowledge you need to achieve your health and fitness goals.\n\nNatureBeat Features: \n•Post your session summary on Twitter to share with friends.\n•Customize your Relax screen images with your favorite pictures. \n•Track your heart rate recovery after exercising. \n•Track the foods you have eaten and your body’s response to them. \n•Save and upload sessions to your secure MySweetBeat account at www.BeatHealthy.com. \n•Email your RRs and session data for personal analysis off-line"

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

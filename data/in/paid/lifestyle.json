With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock."

      "label": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin."

This is an attempt in which I don’t think would have been possible with my own effort and intellect but could do it by the Grace of Sri Sri Radha Madhava and offer this creation in the Lotus feet of Sri Radha Madhava with the hope that it will help Vaishnavas observe fast in the different locations of this globe.\nI know with all the work that has gone into it there must be still shortcomings and mistakes for which I seek apologies in the feet of Vaishnava jans and request to verify these dates with your local temples from where you have been already referring for these times and dates. \n\nThis app is based on the rules put forth by Goswamis for deciding the dates of Ekadasi and Mahadvadasi fast.\nOnly Vaishnava Ekadashi is Supported!\n\nTechnical Features of the app :\n*The app is designed to show the Upcoming Ekadashi Vrat Observing date & Parana timings as soon as you open the app.\n*Katha for the Ekadashi’s are also available\n*Selection of current location can be done manually (latitude, longitude) or by using GPS or web database.\n*Notification support is available with different frequency settings\n*Home-screen widget helps to know the Upcoming Ekadashi Fast on the go\n*Year Calendar View is available wherein all the Ekadasi Fasts are sorted by months\n*Rules of observing Ekadashi fast are included\n*Sunrise time and Brahma Muhurta Timings for the selected locations are also displayed\n*Easy to use UI\n\nYou can feel free to contact us at - contact@itsraghav.com for any suggestions. \n\nDownload Ekadasi App Now\n\nHare Krishna"

Depending on your location, the application choose the appropriate calculation method and Fiqhi school. \n\nFor an accurate location, please ensure that your location settings and your Internet connection or your GPS are enabled!\n\nNote about App features :\n-------------------------------\nIf you are familiar with Salatuk in other platforms please note that this version DOESN'T SUPPORT some features like \"Turn Phone to Silent after Athan\". Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats.

Currently this includes an on-the-fly pitch tracker - so you can practise different ways of speaking and immediately see their effect - as well as unlimited archive space, celebrity comparison graphs, and a charting tool so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWe’re working to expand Vocular to other areas too.

An alarm that irritates me enough to wake up\n √ Exceptional App!! This app is super super annoying... It really gets me out of bed\n √ Love it. It's the best alarm ever\n √ Great Alarm! Been having trouble getting up. No more!\n √ This app is so easy to use, and has all the perfect functions! I'll never be late again!\n\nFEATURED IN THE MEDIA\n √ Definitely one of the more “annoying” alarms to help you get up and out of bed in the morning. – AppAdvice.com\n √ If you are the kind of person who has a difficult time waking up after you’ve turned off your alarm, this app may help keep you from being late for work. - iDownloadBlog\n\nAlso in MacWorld NL, AppsRumors, AppChronicles, etc.\n\nHOW IT WORKS \n\nAs the name \"Step Out!\" implied, the only way you can turn off this alarm clock is STEPPING out of your bed (you still can snooze - in a limited duration). It uses advanced image recognition and step tracking technologies to check whether you’re far away from your bed. \n\nAfter ringing, the app asks you to capture another photo of a specified place, it should be where you usually be every time you wake up, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, ... So you just take a photo and do your routine work like washing your face or preparing breakfast. \n\nAnother alternative is using the step counter, which simplifies this process into just nothing. You wake up and go to wherever you want with the device. After reaching enough number of steps, the alarm will automatically turn off. It’s simply a smarter alarm with no additional action., You’ll love using it from the very first time. \n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n\n- MUSIC ALARM \no Wake up with your favorite songs\no Listen to them when moving\n\n- FULLY FUNCTIONAL ALARM \no Easy setup with hand-drawn mini-game\no Repeating rule for daily, weekly alarms \no Built-in alarm sounds \no Snooze, Vibrate, Fade-in & Volume for the perfect experience \n\n- MOTION TRACKING \no Innovative motion tracking system to sense your steps\no Smart anti-cheat system to make sure that you are stepping\n\n**IMPORTANT: We do not encourage our users to step so fast when you are not totally awake, this app will just recognize the steps when you aren’t walking too fast.\n\n- IMAGE RECOGNITION\no State-of-the-art image recognizing engine\no Can match both horizontal and vertical pictures\no Strict image comparison to assure you’re leaving your bed and your eyes opened wide enough to take the right picture.\n\n**HINT: Choose a scene that has a stable light condition for better matching results.\n\n- SLEEP TIMER \no Fall asleep with music \no Auto-lock and ready for next alarm \n\n- FLASHLIGHT \no Easy to find way through the dark when you are stepping\n\n- CLOCK \no Full feature clock \no Show/hide seconds, 24 hour format, …"

      "label": "Osho describes Gautama Buddha as the greatest breakthrough in the evolution of human consciousness because his discovery of meditation shifted the focus away from praying to a god toward meditation; toward becoming alert to the potential of each human being for godliness. \n\nThe 52 cards in this deck comprise a thoughtful guide to understanding the Buddha’s important contribution to human enlightenment.  \n\nEach card contains a sutra, a commentary by Osho, and a beautiful image of a Buddha statue. \n\nReaders can first enjoy the words as poetry and allow them to evoke an intuitive, emotional response; they can then read Osho’s corresponding entry.\n\nA 53rd card, called Sammasati, represents the last word spoken by Buddha and an inspiring reminder of the readers’ own Buddhahood.\n\nIndividual sutras include Only Love Dispels Hate, Beyond Judgments, Neither Praise nor Blame, Conquer Yourself, Beyond Sorrow, Awake Forever and Shining the Way.\n\nThe app features the following:\n\n- All Cards\n- Sutra\n- Osho’s commentary on the Sutra\n- Discover the Buddha\n- Guide\n- Help\n- Share via Facebook and Twitter\n- Retina display enhanced\n- Save cards to favorites\n- Can be used off-line\n- Set your own notification time for daily readings \n\nThank you for continued feedback; please email mobile@osho.net so we  can continue improving. If you enjoy the app please leave us a store rating.\n\nABOUT OSHO\n\nOsho is a contemporary mystic whose life and teachings have influenced millions of people of all ages, and from all walks of life.  His often provocative and challenging teachings generate today more and more interest and his readership is dramatically expanding around the world in more than fifty languages. People can easily recognize the wisdom of his insights, and their relevance to our lives and to the issues we are facing today.  The Sunday Times in London named Osho as one of the \"1,000 Makers of the 20th Century\". He is known around the world for his revolutionary contribution to meditation – the science of inner transformation – with the unique approach of his \"OSHO Active Meditations\" acknowledging the accelerated pace of contemporary life and bringing meditation into modern life."

      "label": "OSHO Reminding Yourself of the Forgotten Language of Talking to Your BodyMind.\n\nThis is a guided process allowing you to make friends with your body. A voice will guide you into communicating with your body and with your mind to support natural healing and harmony.\n\nThis process is especially developed as:\n¬ a simple, yet powerful relaxation process for relieving the symptoms of stress-related physical discomforts and pain -- including such as headaches, sleeplessness, digestive problems, neck, and shoulder pain and many other body symptoms.\n\n¬ a method for deepening and harmonizing the body-mind connection, which results in an overall improvement in well-being.\n\n¬ a process of befriending the body and becoming more sensitive to its needs, which in turn can help to support other health-related programs such as diet and exercise.\n\n¬ an initial 7-day process which can be repeated but also used on a daily base according to your own structure.\n\nThe roots of this simple technique can be found in the ancient teachings of China and Tibet. Now, these ancient techniques have been revitalized and updated for the twenty-first century according to the guidance of Osho.\n\nThis guided process is a way of reminding us of a language most of us have forgotten. It's the language of communicating with our own body. To communicate with the body, talking to it, listening to its messages has been a well-known practice in ancient Tibet.\n\nModern medical science is only now beginning to recognize what the sages and mystics have always known: that the mind and body are not separate entities but deeply related. The mind can affect the body, just as the body can affect the mind. Osho has created many meditation techniques especially for today's men and women. This guided meditation of talking to the mind and body has been developed with his guidance.\n\nAbout this, Osho explains: \n\n“Once you start communicating with your body, things become very easy. \n\n“The body need not be forced, it can be persuaded. One need not fight with the body – that's ugly, violent, aggressive, and any sort of conflict is going to create more and more tension. So you need not be in any conflict -- let comfort be the rule. And the body is such a beautiful gift from existence that to fight with it, is to deny existence itself. It is a shrine... we are enshrined in it; it is a temple. We exist in it and we have to take every care of it – it is our responsibility. \n\n“So for seven days.... It will look a little absurd in the beginning because we have never been taught to talk to our own body – and miracles can happen through it. They are already happening without our knowing it. When I am saying something to you, my hand follows in a gesture. I am talking to you – it is my mind that is communicating something to you. My body is following it. The body is en rapport with the mind. \n\n“When you want to raise the hand, you have to do nothing – you simply raise it. Just the very idea that you want to raise it and the body follows it; it is a miracle. In fact biology or physiology has not yet been able to explain how it happens. Because an idea is an idea; you want to raise your hand – it is an idea. How does this idea become transformed into a physical message to the hand? And it does not take any time at all – in a split second; sometimes without any time gap. \n\n“For example, I am talking to you and my hand will go on collaborating; there is no time gap. It is as if the body is running parallel to the mind. It is very sensitive – one should learn how to talk to it, and many things can be done.” Osho\n\n\nApp Features:\n\n- Guided relaxations\n- Journaling for your thoughts as you meditate\n- Reminders\n- High-quality audio files\n- Available in English, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, Chinese Traditional , Russian, French, Dutch, Hindi, Japanese, Portugues, Turkish, Hebrew, Korean, Svenska, Estonian, Dansk"

Put the Bible into your daily life. Every time you look at your device! \n\nFEATURES: \n\n- Over 1,100 custom Bible-based iPhone & iPod Touch Lock Screens \n- iOS 9 Support & Design\n- Thumbnail view!\n- Categories (New, Popular, Love, Relationships, Encouragement, Prayer, etc.)\n- 15-second Video Devotionals (from our Instagram page)\n- Universal App optimized for iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch! \n- iPad-specific images, perfect for Landscape & Portrait modes\n- Tap and hold to save to your Camera Roll on your device \n- Many more Bible Lock Screens™ (not available online) \n- Suggest a Verse (suggest verses for new Bible Lock Screens™) \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\niPhone users look at their lock screen many times a day, to use their phone, to check the time, or to use one of the millions of apps available on the iOS platform. \n\nThe lock screen appears for about eight seconds and is the first thing you see when you use your iPhone. Eight seconds is a lot of time to be looking at something random. Why not use a background with Scripture on it! \n\nMy heart is that these Bible Lock Screen backgrounds would help remind you of what the Word of God says and help you walk it out. \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\nAPP STORE REVIEWS: \n\n\"This app is a GREAT buy! By far the best Christian wallpaper app in the AppStore. Such a great way to be encouraged daily by God's word in beautiful art form for your iPhone!\" - Kim S. (iTunes User) \n\n\"This has been so awesome! The variety of lock/home screens available is practically endless. I also love the new update. Flows great! What a great way to profess your faith in the 21st century. Get it!!\" - Lando25 (iTunes User) \n\n\"What a blessing it is to have this app! I'm able to encourage other people by sending them a pic. And when I look at my phone I get to be reminded of my sweet Savior the Lord Jesus Christ! Thanks a million times over! - Torch A. (iTunes User) \n\n\"This app is the best for getting to know Bible verses and if you are having a bad day then you will always have something to look at when you turn on your social networking device.\" - R110545 (iTunes User) \n\n\"I love this app! It has definitely replaced regular lock screen pictures I usually use and is also a great conversation starter when others use my phone! I hope to see even more screen options in the future!\" - Mandi4787 (iTunes User) \n\n---------------------------------------------- \n\nFollow us on Instagram: @BibleLockScreens \n\nLike us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/biblelockscreens \n\nFollow on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/biblelockscreen \n\nCheck us out online: http://www.biblelockscreen.com\n\nFacebook and the Facebook logo are trademarks of Facebook, Inc.

      "label": "Learn the Energization Exercises to awaken your inner source of energy!\n\nParamhansa Yogananda, author of Autobiography of a Yogi, created these exercises. Based on ancient teachings and eternal realities, Yogananda explains that the whole physical universe, including man, is surrounded by, and made of cosmic energy. We can, through the act of our will, release tension that blocks the energy flow to our body and mind, and draw on this infinite storehouse of life-force all around us. Through daily use of these exercises we can systematically recharge our bodies with greater energy and train our minds to understand the true source of that power.\n\nThe full set of Energization Exercises is comprised of 39 individual exercises. Once you become familiar with the routine, it takes about 10–12 minutes to practice.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Diagrams of all of the exercises\n- Optional detailed or brief audio guide for each exercise\n- A Principles of Energization Exercises e-booklet (press the \"i\" info button in top right corner of second screen to access)\n- A counter to track your progress\n\nThe app is based on the book \"Energization Exercises\" from Crystal Clarity Publishers.\n\n“The whole purpose of true exercise is to awaken the inner source of energy which we have ignored throughout our lives.”\n                                    -- Paramhansa Yogananda"

      "label": "Meditation for Busy People offers simple strategies to reduce tension, minimize chronic stress, and quickly relax and unwind. Nobody needs meditation more than people who have no time to meditate. \n\nThese busy people may have tried meditation but given it up, as it seems so difficult to integrate into a hectic lifestyle. Most traditional meditation techniques were developed thousands of years ago for people living a very different lifestyle than today. \n\nFew people today find it easy to just sit down and relax.  \nMeditation for Busy People is filled with methods that can actually be integrated into everyday life. A morning commute becomes a centering exercise, and the street noises outside an apartment window in the city become an aid rather than a distraction to finding the silent space within. \n\nBoth active and passive meditation techniques are covered, and the aim of all the techniques is to teach the practitioner how to find the stillness in the storm of everyday life. Many methods are specially designed to be integrated into the reader's everyday routines, so that they soon can tackle even the most hectic day with an attitude of relaxed calm and playfulness.\n\nApp Features:\n\n• 21 Insights in Osho's voice\n• 21 Practical meditations that can be done on the go!\n• Make notes and easily share your meditations with friends\n• Can be used off-line\n• Retina support\n\nThank you for continued feedback; please email mobile@osho.net so we can continue improving. If you enjoy the app please leave us a store rating.\n\nABOUT OSHO\n\nOsho is a contemporary mystic whose life and teachings have influenced millions of people of all ages, and from all walks of life.  His often provocative and challenging teachings generate today more and more interest and his readership is dramatically expanding around the world in more than fifty languages. People can easily recognize the wisdom of his insights, and their relevance to our lives and to the issues we are facing today.  The Sunday Times in London named Osho as one of the \"1,000 Makers of the 20th Century\". He is known around the world for his revolutionary contribution to meditation – the science of inner transformation – with the unique approach of his \"OSHO Active Meditations\" acknowledging the accelerated pace of contemporary life and bringing meditation into modern life."

Bottoms up!\"\n\n- Wall Street Journal - Eric Felten\nIf you're just browsing, hunting for something tasty to try, how do you narrow your selections down to a manageable lot? One iPhone app, Cocktails Made Easy, solves that problem admirably...\n\nFeatures\n- 500+ Easy to follow cocktail recipes.\n- All recipes can be made with just 14 key ingredients.\n- All recipes accompanied by a FULL screen colour photograph.\n- All cocktails contain a comment and rating form top British drinks aficionado Simon Difford.\n- Every necessary ingredient listed including all fruits and mixers.\n- Add your own cocktails rating.\n- Add your own cocktail notes.\n- Create your personal favourite cocktail list.\n- Mark bottles you already own in the 'Cocktail Cabinet' to see which drinks you can make.\n- Shake the iPhone or iPod Touch for a random cocktail recipe.\n- Search for cocktails by either name, rating or ingredients.\n- View all screens in Landscape or Portrait mode.\n- Email recipes to your friends.\n- 'Pin' a cocktail to stop the iPhone/iPod Touch from going to sleep.\n- 'Pin' a cocktail when passing the iPhone/iPod Touch to stop cocktail recipe changing (through Shake feature).\n- Help screens available throughout the application through 'Info' button.\n- Operates without an internet connection.\n\nWhat customers are saying :-\n\n5 Star - Simon Difford DELIVERS \n(US iTunes Review Tiki Bar TV)\n....Simon's books blend masterful mixology with absolutely gorgeous graphic design...... this app has the same classy design and fantastic cocktails as Simon's books. The writing is clean and witty. The drinks? Delicious. \n\n5 Star - Fantastic!! \n(UK iTunes review)\nI didn't think that this application would be up to the same standard set by the book (which is THE definitive cocktail bible), but I couldn't have been more wrong! It's every bit as informative as the book, and the fact that it's interactive - it lists the cocktails that you can make from the drinks in your cabinet - makes it even easier to use. And at the price of half a pint of beer, it's astonishingly under-priced for such a brilliant application.\n\n5 Star - Marvelous \n(UK iTunes review)\nLooks as good as the books, fits in the pocket......."

All you need to know is one of the sizes — the application will tell the rest. Making a shopping trip to another country, online purchasing and an unexpected gift to your beloved will be easier when you can convert sizes on the go.\n\nWhy do we make Sizer?\n\nToday there is no easy way to order clothes online and be sure that it will fit on you well. Size charts do not help, because the size varies and depends on the brand, season, style and region. Size is the reason for the return of 30% of purchased goods online.\n\nSizer is designed to solve this problem - a smart algorithm that learns based on user data:\n1) be brave in online shopping;\n2) forget about returns;\n3) save shopping from stress.\n\n\nHow does Sizer work?\n\n1. You select sizes with the help of our algorithm.\n2. With the help of a button you give feedback - fit or didn’t fit.\n3. Sizer teaches the sizing algorithm.\n\nShopping is no longer a lottery with Sizer.\n\n\n\"An application that remembers that last year your jeans were two sizes smaller.\"\nGQ Russia\n\n\"You could've just said \"We have Beautiful Pixels!\". Seriously, loved the app.\"\n— BeautifulPixels.com"

As you listen your brainwaves fall into step with this inaudible beat, and after several minutes synchronize with the target frequency. \n\nBrain Wave Altered State uses the most advanced multi-stage binaural sequences available, combined with the flexibility to choose from a range of relaxing ambient backgrounds, other audio apps, or your own iTunes Music, allowing your mind you to relax and synchronize with your desired state.  It achieves this using our unique process called Progressive Brainwave Entrainment.\n\n*** Progressive Brainwave Entrainment ***\n\nProgressive Brainwave Entrainment algorithms use layers of frequencies and carrier signals assembled in precise sequences to create profoundly unique experiences.  Each program gently brings your brainwave frequencies to your desired state using a more natural frequency progression.\n\n*** Advanced Features ***\n\n - 20 Brainwave programs each specially designed for a different situation and desired mental state.\n\n - 17 ambient background sounds to choose from.\n\n - Independently adjustable ambient sound volume.\n\n - Visual timer countdown indicator.\n\n - Automatic storage of preferred brainwave program and ambient background.\n\n - Ability to set your own custom program duration.\n\n\n* Programs Included *\n\n - Chakra Meditation:  A series of balanced, meditative brainwave programs each taking you to a different, deeper meditative state, ending in the ultimate state of meditation and calm.\n\n - Euphoric Bliss:  The ultimate brainwave program designed to gently bring your mind through a series of uplifting states, culminating in a state of euphoria and bliss.  This program will truly make your mood soar.\n\n - Lucid Beta Dreams:  This program combines elements of meditative and dreaming frequencies to create a state where you can experience waking dreams and truly escape.  Lucid dreaming is a very unique state of consciousness where you will find yourself slipping in out of dreams while remaining aware of them.\n\n - Tranquil Thoughts:  Designed simply to relax, this program progressively drops your mind into deeper states of relaxation to help you unwind and reduce stress.\n\n - Inspired Creativity:  Creates an elevated state of creativity by combining a series of focus, concentration and meditative frequencies to help you open your mind to new ideas and boost creativity.\n\n - Floating:  A unique meditative program that combines lower frequency meditative sequences with higher frequency lucid dreaming programs to create a relaxed, yet heightened state of awareness.\n\n - Quiet Mind:  Designed to help you clear your mind and empty your thoughts for a deeply relaxed state of mind.\n\n- Mindful Meditation:  Achieve a calm, centered state of mindfulness.\n\n - Other Programs:\n\n   - Morning Zen\n   - Natural High\n   - Awakened Mind\n   - Deep Reflection\n   - Astral Projection\n   - Zen Meditation\n   - High Beta Dreams\n   - Heightened Awareness\n   - Beta Meditation\n   - Gamma Meditation\n   - High Theta Meditation\n   - Full Theta Spectrum\n\nThese programs are powerful and can take effect quickly and should never be used while driving or operating machinery.

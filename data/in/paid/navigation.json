      "label": "A high quality Speedometer, GPS tracker and trip cost monitor for iPhones and cellular iPads. \n∙∙ When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! \n∙∙ The cost monitor shows you the current cost of the journey as you drive and tells you each passengers share. \n∙∙ GPS tracker records your trips so they can be analyzed, viewed and shared at any moment.\n\n‣‣ COST MONITOR. What's the cost of my driving?\nBased on gas price for a gallon or litre, MPG (U.S. or UK) or liters per 100 km the app will tell you what the cost is as you drive. You can add an extra cost per kilometer or mile! Useful for all cost aware drivers and for splitting the cost between passengers.\n\n‣‣ GPS TRACKING. Where I've been? How long did it take to get from A to B? \nSpeedometer records your trip statistics even when GPS tracker is switched off. When you need point by point data to see on the map later or export (Google Earth and GPX), speedometer gives you the first class GPS tracker.\n\n‣‣ INFOTAINMENT. \nWhen switched on, infotainment shows trip stats or weather/wind forecast  when you wait. Way better than just showing you a 0 speed!\n\n‣‣ Easy to set speed limits and SPEED LIMIT MEMORY option\nSet speed limits with 4 or 8 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! With SPEED LIMIT MEMORY you just apply the speed limit once and the app applies it for you automatically the next time!\n\n‣‣ MODES\nUse MENU>MODES to turn the app into a Rally computer, G-Force monitor, Camera alerter or taximeter! Currently there are 12 modes available and we are constantly adding new ones.\n\n‣‣ WAYPOINTS.\nSpeedometer gives you the unique way to leave a note with location and even optional photo or audio note attached! As easy as double tap on the big speed digits! You'll find more in a documentation section (star button).\n\n‣‣ RED LIGHT & SPEED CAMERAS\nImport camera data into speedometer in Garmin or iGO csv formats from poi-factory.com, scdb.info or poi-plaza and let speedo alert you on a camera approach and set speed limit automatically before you pass the speed camera!\n\n‣‣ SUNSET/SUNRISE\nWith the sunset and sunrise information that our speedometer provides, you'll be able to avoid driving in the dusk.\n\n‣‣ BARO VSI. Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\n‣‣ VOICE COACH. When enabled and configured, voice coach will be telling you active track distance and duration as well as current speed and altitude.\n\n‣‣ MAPS. Google's native, Apple map, Blank map and Offline maps.\n\n‣‣ Siri shortcuts: New Track, Stop Track, Speed limits.\n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics.\n\n+ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KM/H AND KNOTS. Maximum/TOP, average speed, distance traveled.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Speedometer will work in background if told so and will still warn you with audio alert when exceed a preset speed limit. You can use other apps while speedometer does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Speedometer never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for tracking your speed and recording the GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always let you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless it is explicitly told to do so.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nDrive safely, keep the log and notes and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal companion no matter what journey you are going on!"

      "label": "Theodolite was one of the earliest augmented reality (AR) apps for iOS when it debuted in 2009 -- in fact Theodolite was pioneering AR technology before \"AR\" was even a buzzword! In the time since, Theodolite has been used by millions of consumers and professionals in their outdoor adventures and on the job. Now, we've taken the Theodolite concept to Apple Watch by combining a compass, inclinometer, GPS, and maps into one indispensable app that sits on your wrist. We're excited to keep evolving this centuries-old instrument as hardware and software technologies allow the concept to come to new device formats.\n\nOn iPhone and iPad, Theodolite uses a viewfinder format, uniting the device sensors (GPS, magnetometer, gyro, accelerometer) and camera.  On Apple Watch, Theodolite combines data from these sensors into an AHRS (attitude and heading reference system) layout similar to what you'd see in the glass cockpit of a modern aircraft. This layout allows Theodolite to efficiently display compass bearing (yaw angle), pitch angle, and roll angle in a compact format that works extremely well on a small screen.  This information is augmented by latitude, longitude, and altitude from GPS, as well as sun and moon position.\n\nNew in Theodolite for Watch version 2 is a map screen and waypoint manager.  You can add waypoints on the map or at your current location, and view waypoints on the compass ring to visualize their bearing from your current location.\n\nTheodolite has settings for compass mode (true or magnetic), distance/altitude units (feet or meters), and position format (decimal degrees, degrees-minutes-seconds, MGRS, USNG, UTM, UTM-B, and Maidenhead Locator System).  Users can choose to display an artificial horizon in the center of the app display (tied to pitch and roll) and can set the app's level reference to flat or vertical orientations of the Watch.  The app has six color schemes, including two night vision modes - midnight red and luminescent green.\n\nTheodolite for Watch is recommended for Apple Watch Series 5 and later (including Ultra).  Apple Watch Series 4 and older do not have a compass sensor and will not show compass data.  On older devices, the app uses the device's gyro sensor to measure rotation.  You can twist the watch's digital crown to adjust and calibrate the gyro to the sun position, moon position, or a known bearing.  Using these references, the \"gyro compass\" is able to give bearing.  The calibration can be repeated as often as desired to give accurate results.\n\nTheodolite reports accuracy from the magnetometer sensor in your Watch.  To improve results, operate Theodolite away from magnets, electronics, or sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.\n\nLike all our apps, we plan to continually improve and evolve Theodolite for Watch.  Please contact us with feature requests, suggestions, and general feedback.  We'd love to hear what you're doing with the app!  And if you don't already have Theodolite for your iPhone or iPad, check it out!"

      "label": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, planets, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!"

(You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "“Awesome!!! The best speed app on iphone” 5 Stars by kurtonic\n\nSpeed Box is a Speedometer and GPS app for both your iPhone and iPad. It displays your current speed, distance, direction and altitude along with your top speed and average speed. The app also keeps a record of the speed and altitude for the last few hours.\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n========================\n\n* MPH, KM/H and KNOTS\n* Show decimal speed (e.g. \"45.7 mph\")\n* One app for both the iPhone and iPad\n* \"Speak speed\" - Tap screen to have the speed spoken to you\n* 11 Analog and digital speedometers\n* Map view\n* Maximum and average speed\n* Altitude \n* Digital compass \n* HUD display to see speed in windshield \n* Odometer to measure distance traveled \n* Chart of the traveled speed and altitude \n* Warning signal when driving too fast \n* Export last 3 hours of data \n* Change maximum displayed speed on speedometer \n* Swipe finger over chart to display historic data \n* Display GPS accuracy by tapping the indicator in the top left corner \n\n\nUSER REVIEWS\n========================\n\n5 Stars by Darekakuta \n\"Just what I needed. My '58 chev's speedo doesn't work. This did the trick.\" \n\n5 Stars by Rawd \n\"Great My 79 Firebird speedo only goes to 140 kmh. ;). This worked perfectly.\" \n\n5 Stars \n\"Within 1 mile per hour +/- Great Job!\" \n\nSpeedBox was one of the very early Speedometer Apps for the iPhone. Take advantage of my experience and the refined algorithms that can get a much greater accuracy from the iPhone then a lot of other apps. I regularly update my application to make it even more accurate and usable. \n\nUsers have already used our application to verify the accuracy of their car's speedometer or they tried measuring the speed they achieved while skiing. Can you come up with more ideas? How about measuring the speed of the airplane you travel with? \n\nUSAGE NOTES\n========================\nThe \"GPS strength\" indicator in the top left corner should display a green dot. You can tap this indicator to display the current GPS accuracy.\n\nPlease allow the application up to a minute to find enough satellites to work correctly. \n\nIf you get a message to enable GSP, please go to ”Settings > General > Location Services“ on your iPhone and check if the little switch is set to \"On\" for Speed Box as well as for \"Location Services\" in general. \n\nATTENTION iPod touch users! Unfortunately this app doesn't work very well on the iPod touch and the iPad WiFI (without 3G) since these devices are missing a GPS!\n\n\nFEEDBACK\n========================\nIf you've got any wishes or suggestions for new features, please let me know with the contact form on this application's website (see link below).\n\nI am already working on the next update!"

Using the GPS features of this app can significantly affect battery life. Only leave GPS enabled when you need to use it. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Pocket Earth only uses GPS in the background for route navigation and gps track recording features. \n   2. This app uses data from the amazing community driven open mapping project called openstreetmap.org!  Coverage detail may vary by region, please visit our website to check the map detail for your regions of interest.\n   3.

For example, an E6B can be used to calculate heading and groundspeed after taking into account forecast winds. An E6B is also used to calculate data used for performance planning such as density altitude.  Our version goes beyond the analog E6B and even beyond all other E6B apps by including functionality to calculate time, rate and radius of turns, pivotal altitude (great for flight training use), and more."

The timer counts either up or down, and will display an alert when reaching zero.\r\n\r\n27 AVIATION FUNCTIONS\r\n \r\n-Pressure & Density Altitude\r\n-Planned True Airspeed\r\n-Heading and Groundspeed\r\n-Compass Heading\r\n-Leg Time\r\n-Fuel Required\r\n-Crosswind, Headwind and Tailwind\r\n-Cloud Base and Freezing Level\r\n-Actual True Airspeed\r\n-Actual True Altitude\r\n-Wind Speed and Direction\r\n-Groundspeed\r\n-Planned Mach Number\r\n-Required True Airspeed\r\n-Required Calibrated Airspeed\r\n-Distance Flown\r\n-Endurance\r\n-Fuel per Hour\r\n-Actual Mach Number\r\n-Percent Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC)\r\n-Hydroplane Speed\r\n-Required Rate of Climb\r\n-Specific Range\r\n-Pivotal Altitude\r\n-Top of Descent\r\n-Required Rate of Descent\r\n-Glide Distance\r\n\r\n22 AVIATION CONVERSIONS\r\n \r\n-Celsius :: Fahrenheit\r\n-Nautical Miles :: Statute Miles\r\n-Nautical Miles :: Kilometers\r\n-Feet :: Meters\r\n-Pounds :: Kilograms\r\n-Avgas Gallons :: Pounds\r\n-Jet A Gallons :: Pounds\r\n-Gallons :: Liters\r\n-Hours/Minutes/Seconds :: Hours\r\n-Climb FT/NM :: Climb Percent\r\n-Climb FT/NM :: Climb Degrees\r\n\r\nCALCULATOR\r\n \r\n-Perform basic math without having to exit the application\r\n\r\nCLOCK/TIMER\r\n \r\n-Simultaneous tracking of Zulu, Home and Local time zones\r\n-Advanced timer counts up or down and operates independently so you can perform other calculations while the timer is running\r\n-Upon reaching zero in the countdown mode, a message will display no matter what app is active  – a useful feature for missed approaches, switching fuel tanks, etc."

      "label": "BlindSquare is pioneering accessible navigation both indoors and outdoors. Know where you are, know where you're going, travel with confidence.\n\nBlindSquare is a new solution that combines the latest technology to help the blind with their daily lives. It has been developed in collaboration with blind people and carefully field tested. You need either an iPhone or an iPad to get started. It also supports some additional accessories to enhance the experience. \n\nHow does it work? \n\nBlindSquare uses GPS and the compass to locate you. It then gathers information about the surrounding environment from FourSquare. BlindSquare has some unique algorithms to decide what information is the most relevant and then speaks it to you with high quality speech synthesis. \n“What's the most popular café within 200 meters radius? Where is the post office or the library?” \n\nYou can control BlindSquare also through voice commands. The Voice Command feature is a premium service requiring purchase of credits for continuous use.  Voice Command Credits are available as an in-app purchase on the App Store.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a GPS solution:\n\nWhen you start the app, it will start telling you the interesting places and street crossings around you. By changing the radius, you can limit the area you are interested in. You can also search by search term or by category. You can select an interesting place from the search results and perform the following tasks:\n\n1) Get contact info (address, phone number) \n2) Open twitter feed or restaurant menu (if provided)\n3) Make a phone call\n4) Start tracking the place (BlindSquare will assist you by repeating the distance and the clock face direction)\n5) Start your favourite navigator for turn-by-turn instructions (TomTom, Navigon or Apple Maps)\n\nBlindSquare is aware of when you travel by car, bus or train and starts to report interesting places in front of you (for example, the next stops) and street crossings when you are passing them.\n\nYou can also save your own private places to iCloud so they will be found with your every device.\n\nUsing BlindSquare as a Foursquare client:\n\nIf you like to play Foursquare, you can do the following with BlindSquare:\n \n1) Get a list of nearby FourSquare venues\n2) When you are in a place, you can check in by shaking your device\n3) Do a check in with commenting and twitter/facebook sharing\n4) Correct the location of the place\n\nBlindSquare supports the following languages: English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean (South Korea), Norwegian, Polish, Portugues, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nVoiceOver usage is supported but it also includes higher quality additional speech synthesis by Acapela Text-To-Speech from Acapela Group.\n \nInstructions in English: https://www.blindsquare.com/user-guide/ and https://www.blindsquare.com/faq/\n\nPlease note: This app retrieves data in real time from Foursquare and Open Street Map. Use of a flat rate data plan is highly recommended.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nHaving only been released in May 2012, BlindSquare has already received several prizes and awards:\n\n - GSMA: Global Mobile Awards 2013, Best Mobile Health Product or Service\n - Apps4Finland 2012\n - OpenCities App Challenge 2012\n - The Finnish Information Processing Association: Best Product 2012\n\nPlease note: To use BlindSquare, your iCloud account has to be active so BlindSquare can access it to save your settings and places.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Save time and money on your instrument flight training by mastering IFR holding pattern entries at the comfort of your own mobile device.\n\nMake IFR flight training easier!\n\nIs the following scenario familiar? You receive a holding clearance from ATC, and only have a couple of minutes, sometimes only a few seconds, to choose the correct entry. By the time you've figured out what's going on, you've already passed the holding fix and don't know what to do next.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, then you need not to worry. Confusion during holding entries happens to practically almost every new instrument student. Even instrument-rated pilots occasionally have the same problem — when they don't get enough practice.\n\nHolding Trainer solves this problem and as a result, cuts the time you have to spend on expensive flight and ground lessons. With Holding Trainer, you can practice on your own time and convenience, so that choosing the best holding entry in the air becomes a breeze. \n\n\nFeatures: \n\n-Entry Trainer - Drills you on choosing the best holding entry. Practice until choosing holding entries becomes second nature and impress your flight instructor with your skills.\n\n-Holding calculator. Solve and visualize any holding scenario by entering your current bearing to the fix and a outbound or inbound holding radial. \n\n-Holding tutorial - learn how to choose the best holding entry quickly and easily.\n\nHolding Trainer for iOS is a complete rewrite based on my popular Flash-based desktop Holding Trainer app available on pilotscafe.com.\n\n***Don't get \"stuck\" next time you receive a holding pattern clearance!***\n----------------------------------\nFor only a fraction of the cost of one ground lesson with your flight instructor, you can practice this important instrument skill at your own pace and save hundreds of Dollars on figuring out holding entries in the air.\n\nThis is a great tool for anyone training towards their instrument checkride, CFII, proficiency check, or simply trying to improve their holding patterns.\n----------------------------------"

      "label": "Featured by Apple in “Best New Apps”!\n\nPlan your next trip. Mark places you want to go. Remember your favorite spots. Across town or across the world, you’ll never forget another place with Pinbox!\n\nAdd pins where you are, where you’ve been, or where you want to go. Pinbox makes it easy to quickly record and organize your important places into distinct maps for every activity, occasion, or geographic region.\n\nUnlike other apps, Pinbox doesn’t force you to save all your places on a single map. You can make one map for your favorite local restaurants - make another map for your next business trip or vacation - and make another map for errands you need to run this weekend. The possibilities are endless!\n\nPinbox is about you and your places. It’s not a social network. You don’t have to create an account or enter your Facebook details to use the app. Your maps aren’t cluttered with random places bookmarked by strangers. Pinbox is simply the best app for privately bookmarking places that are important to YOU!\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Simple, easy-to-use interface\n• Drop a pin for each place you want to remember\n• Add photos, notes, and other details to each pin\n• Choose from seven different pin colors\n• Organize your pins into separate maps\n• See your location in relation to your pins\n• Send maps to other Pinbox users\n• Send pins to Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze, or Transit for directions\n• Save up to 2,500 pins\n• Display maps in Standard, Hybrid, or Satellite\n\nEXAMPLES OF MAPS YOU MIGHT CREATE\n\n• Travel planning\n• Favorite restaurants or restaurants to try\n• Customer locations / sales calls\n• Friends and family locations\n• Real Estate listings\n• Favorite hiking / biking trails\n• Secret fishing spots\n• Dog-friendly places\n• Parking spots\n• Favorite stores\n• Multi-stop errands\n• Potential photoshoot locations\n• The list goes on and on and on…\n\n\nStill not convinced? Here’s a few of our favorite reviews…\n\n\n“Pinbox is one of those simple apps that does one thing so well it feels frictionless”.\n-- Stephen Grassie\n\n\n“The interface is gorgeous - I would say that it looks like something Apple designed”.\n-- Macaddict\n\n\n“I have been using this to keep track of all the places the kids and I go so they can see how spread out our world is and they can see where all we have gone. Will use it forever”.\n-- 1Cool Daddy\n\n\n“This app is extremely useful and so simple to use. A lifesaver for keeping track of locations”.\n-- Davies Photo\n\n\n“I love this app. It is exactly what it claims to be. I have wanted this app since the smartphone was invented. So simple, and so many uses”.\n-- T1Man\n\n\n\nUsing Pinbox on an iPod Touch or an iPad:\nLike other map apps, Pinbox uses GPS to determine your location. iPods and Wi-Fi-only iPads do not have a GPS receiver. On these devices, Pinbox provides your approximate location using information based on your proximity to known Wi-Fi networks (when on and available). The more accurate the available information, the smaller the circle identifying your position on the map. This feature is not available in all areas. Known Wi-Fi networks are predominantly in urban areas. An internet connection is required to load maps, look up addresses, and search. Although Pinbox can be installed on iPads, it’s not formatted for the larger iPad screen - it runs doubled like all other iPhone apps.\n\n\n\nPinbox is the result of a collaboration between Scott D. Smith and Paul Burd. We sincerely hope you like it!"

      "label": "The first and only Vector Magnetometer on the iPhone - Visualize the hidden world of magnetism around you in 3 dimensions (3GS or later!)! It can be perfectly used to explore and measure the direction and strength of the magnetic field of random objects around you (which can be quite fascinating!). With limitations (see docs) it can be used as a metal detector to find electric lines or pipes in walls (always good to check a wall before drilling in, at least better with this than not to check at all). Another application is to use this tool as a rough estimate of your north-south position on earth without using the GPS(!) - just by measuring the local earth magnetic declination (it works fine even while flying in a plane to check how the declination changes). Or simply explore your next Christmas present before opening it! Send us your results!\n\n\nThe application has four different displays modes to visualize the magnetic field:\n\n- Absolute Mode: Displays the absolute magnetic field in microtesla (μT) measured by the magnetometer.\n\n- North Mode: A compass head-up displays the geographic north along with the pointer that directs to the magnetic north (thus display difference magnetic to geographic north).\n\n- Declination Mode: Two arrows will be displayed to indicate the declination of the earth magnetic field (0° just on equator, increasing to north with blue pointer direction up or south with blue pointer direction down). \n\n- Relative Mode: This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the magnetic field in μT. \n\n\n… and five different display modes for acceleration visualization: \n\n- Absolute Mode: Displays the reverse acceleration of the iPhone (1g up when hold steady). \n\n- X-Rotation - Y-Rotation - Z-Rotation: The arrow will display the rotation around the X-, Y- and Z-Axis of the iPhone. The digital indicator shows the angle numerically (-180° - +180°). A way to calibrate will be added with one of the next updates, so you could use this as a level.\n\n- Relative Mode: This mode shows the relative strength (absolute minus compensation vector) of the acceleration.\n\n\nFor a detailed documentation, please visit our product homepage. \n\n\nFor recreational use only. However it CAN (!) be very accurate. The measurement is performed as good as possible (we try our best) by using the inbuilt accelerometer and magnetometer to their limits. The range of the accelerometer typically has a max of ±3g (~4.2g displayed here if combined) and each magnetometer usually recalibrates internally when over ±120μT in one axis. However, tell us your experience!"

      "label": "PlaceTrack is a modern, powerful, full-featured location journaling and sharing app for iPhone. It keeps a history of your locations with speed, course, altitude, and user activity data, lets you track your loved ones, check the speed they are travelling, get directions to their current location or view a street level picture of any place they are or they have been. You can also overlay and compare your contacts location against a GPX track: import from files, Strava or Apple Watch workout routes (the app integrates with HealthKit)\n\nMain features include:\n- safe location sharing with the people you trust, in real time\n- live data: force a contact’s device to immediately send a fresh location\n- passive and battery friendly: run in the background with no noticeable impact on battery life, location is periodically updated as the device moves\n- context data: location data can include location history, speed and course, altitude, whether you’re walking, running, moving in a vehicle or resting\n- you are in control: set who sees your current location or who has access to your location history with fine-grained access controls\n\nOther features: \n- excellent battery usage: PlaceTrack uses SLC mode (Significant Location Change) and region monitoring, NOT continuous background. PlaceTrack is suspended in the background most of the time and is woken up only when you move significantly (detected using cell towers signal); most of the time it just sleeps and the GPS hardware is powered off to preserve battery. Install the app and forget about it\n- save your location history for later viewing\n- optionally share your recent location or location history with authorized PlaceTrack contacts\n- forced contact location updates: you can ask for a live location update from a contact and the backend platform will silently ask your contact device for a new location update \n- delayed sync: stores your locations when network is unreachable and pushes them to the PlaceTrack servers when you're back online \n- in-app streetview images\n- track overlays: import route data from Apple Watch, Strava and GPX files\n- location sharing works using address book phone numbers: your phone number is authenticated through an sms code on your first activation \n- your data, including your phone number and location, is always sent on a secure connection (ssl) and is never shared with any third party"

We love this mode! We found it much more convenient compared to traditional car dashboards (especially on the roads of Western Europe, which are full of speed cameras and where you need to watch your speedometer all the time). And last but not the least - it just looks cool.  Note: this mode works pretty well at night time and twilight, but on direct sunlight the screen brightness can be insufficient.\n\n- \"aSmart HUD\" can keep track on 4 speed limits, giving a warning (sound and visual) each time you crossing it. Normally, it's legal speed limits within cities, local roads and high-speed motorways. \"Never exceed speed\" is the speed you should not exceed under any conditions. For example, it can be a technical limit of your vehicle or the point where government can arrest your driving license. \n\n- You can skip/rewind/play/pause your current iPod music track, select the playlist or set the Shuffle or Repeat iPod mode.\n\n- Weather forecast time intervals and temperature units (C, F) are selectable in Preferences.\n\n- You can quickly take a photo of what's going on the road. Photo will be automatically saved into the Photos Album. The speedometer image, map and a some of other useful information will be placed over your photo. \n\n- Landscape and Portrait screen layouts support.\n\n- Three different compass styles, sound themes, colors, etc.\n\n- 4 functionally different display themes.\n\n- Speed history log chart. \n\n- \"Location Info\"  - longitude and latitude, GPS measurement precision and some more data.\n\n- \"Records\" screen (left upper button on the \"Location Info\" screen), where you can see your maximum reached speed (during the current trip or all of your trips), maximum altitude and maximum distance from start.\n\n- Tap the speed indicator to switch into speed fullscreen mode. \n \nIMPORTANT: for more screenshots and details visit the http://atoll-ordenadores.com website\n\nLimitations \n- The precision is affected by the satellite signal quality. If unsure, use the program only for reference, don't rely on it for 100%. Application requires real A-GPS chip - so, no iPod and not-3G iPad supported. On iPad 3G application function only in \"double pixel\" mode.\n\nThanks to everyone for your suggestions about additional functionality! THE BEST AND FASTEST WAY TO CONTACT US IS SENDING YOUR REQUESTS AND BUG REPORTS to support@atoll-ordenadores.com. WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED  IN DIALOG, what is not possible when you leaving the bug-report as AppStore review."

      "label": "Pro Compass replicates the look and feel of classic pocket compass hardware in use since the 1800s, adding modern features and technologies.  The app uses advanced OpenGL graphics (normally reserved for games) to render 3D floating compass hardware for realistic operation.\n\nPro Compass offers nine different compass modes with direct read, traditional, and rosette styles capable of displaying degrees, quads, or mils (the direct read mode shows a North-South needle and reversed East-West convention).  In all display modes, Pro Compass shows both magnetic and true direction simultaneously, with a rotating outer true ring that is automatically adjusted for local magnetic declination.  Sun and Moon position are marked on the compass rings and continually updated.\n\nPro Compass displays location and altitude, with decimal, degree-minute-second, UTM, and MGRS position formats.  An optional \"Datum Pack\" adds over 230 geodetic datums covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.  The app also contains a built in two-axis inclinometer that drives two independent bubble levels and a bullseye level.  The inclinometer has angle readout dials for each axis, making it useful for many different types of measurements including slopes, pitches, sight lines, and geological angles like dip and strike. \n\nAfter using Pro Compass, you'll see why it's the best and most realistic compass available on the App Store!  Also be sure to check out the new Pro Compass for Watch, available for all Apple Watch models running watchOS 6 or later.\n\n***** IMPORTANT ACCURACY NOTE *****\n\nPro Compass reports accuracy directly from the magnetometer sensor in your device.  This accuracy is determined by the hardware, not the application itself.\n\nTo improve results, operate Pro Compass away from any electronics or other sources of electro-magnetic interference, including car dashboards, aircraft cockpits, metal structures, and other devices.  \n\nPlease contact the developer via the support link if you need additional information about accuracy or operation of Pro Compass."

      "label": "There are hundreds of gps apps. Do we really need one more?\n\nAriadne GPS is more than a simple gps app.\n\nBesides offering you the possibility to know your position and to get information about the street, the number, etc. it also lets you explore the map of what's around you.\n\nWhat do we mean by saying \"explore\"? You'll deal with a talking map. If you have VoiceOver activated on your device, you will be able to know the street names and numbers that are around you by touching them.\nJust put your finger on the screen of your device, when showing the map and moving it you will be told the info's about the street you're touching.\nYour position is on the center of the screen. What's in front of you is on the top half of the screen and things behind you are on the bottom half of the screen.\n\nYou can also explore a different region than the one around you by telling the app the street and the city.\n\nYou can ask for information about your position at any time, also activating a function, called monitor, that will give you this info periodically (Please read the note below).\nThis app has also got some other useful features that might help when walking or traveling by bus, train etc.\nIf you add your favourite points to the app database, you can be alerted when you get closer than a certain distance to one of them.\n\nThis app is completely accessible using VoiceOver and gives you access to information that are normally unavailable to people using the speech synthesizer and can be therefore especially useful to blind and partially sighted people. \n\nNote: The features of Ariadne GPS are based on the location services and on the Maps server for what concerns the information about the position. This information may not be accurate, due to the location accuracy, which is generally below fifteen metres but in some cases can be few tens of metres and to the Maps service, which might be unresponsive at certain times (Ariadne GPS will tell you if this is the case). The aim of Ariadne GPS is to give you an idea of your position and what is around you. Please do not completely rely on it.\n\nPlease note that the use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nFor more info and suggestions please visit http://www.ariadnegps.eu"

      "label": "Pro Altimeter uses the high-fidelity barometric pressure sensor in iOS devices to measure and compute altitude.\n\nPro Altimeter has a dead simple interface.  Barometric altitude and GPS altitude are displayed in large easy to read numbers, showing units of both feet and meters, and giving realtime accuracy estimates from the hardware.  At bottom are calibration and display mode buttons. The display offers a highly-readable daytime mode with black digits on an LCD-green background, and a reversed night mode that is easy on the eyes in dark conditions. That's it!\n\nProper calibration is necessary to measure altitude from barometric pressure (this is why a pilot \"dials in\" the cockpit altimeter before taking off). Pro Altimeter offers four different methods for calibration -- choose the easiest and most convenient:\n\n1. Use GPS altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with the altitude measured by GPS. This method can be used when your device has a clear line of sight to the sky and a reliable GPS fix with good accuracy.\n\n2. Manually enter altitude.  This method correlates the measured local barometric pressure with known altitude from landmarks, elevation benchmarks, trail markers, topo maps, land surveys, etc.  Altitude can be entered in feet or meters.\n\n3. Manually enter pressure.  If you have a weather station, weather report, or METAR report with equivalent sea level pressure for a nearby location, this can be used to correlate local barometric pressure to altitude.  Pressure can be entered with units of inches Hg, kPa, or mb. \n\n4. Check local airports.  With the tap of a button, Pro Altimeter will locate the five closest airports within 100 miles (160km) of your present location anywhere in the world, and pull in METAR data.  From that list of five, pick the airport of your choice and Pro Altimeter will import pressure data for calibration.\n\nOnce calibrated, Pro Altimeter keeps track of the time since its last calibration.  Because weather and local barometric pressure change over time, the app will warn you when 6 hours have elapsed since the last calibration by flashing the \"CALIBRATE\" button.  You should calibrate as frequently as practical -- for example, on a hike, calibrate whenever you pass a trail marker or elevation benchmark.  But at a minimum, calibrate at least every 6 hours or whenever weather changes in your area.\n\nPro Altimeter is intended for iOS devices with a built-in barometric pressure sensor (iPhone 6 and later, iPad Air 2 and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPad Pro).  On older devices without a barometric pressure sensor, only GPS altitude and accuracy will be displayed.  \n\nIf you have an Apple Watch, check out the new Pro Altimeter for Watch and get all this same functionality on your wrist!"

However, some sites set up their feeds to only show a portion of each entry, you know, to get you to click through to their actual website. We find that really annoying, and we're sure you do too.\n\nWhich is why, unlike other RSS feed readers, that either push you into a browser (in-app or otherwise), or depend on third party text parsing services and require you to be online to fetch the full text of one article at a time (which makes it no different from having to click/tap through to a website), in lire, you get your favorite RSS feeds as they should've been. You don't need to click through to any website (though, you do still have the option to, if you really wanted). It takes your favorite partial feeds, does its magic, and converts them in to full feeds, so you don't have to click/tap on those annoying 'Read more' or 'Continue reading' links.\n\nOnce they're cached, you don't even need to be connected to read your full-text feeds.\n\nUse as a standalone feed reader, sync with iCloud,\n\nor,\n\nsync with any of the several services: Feedly, Feedbin, FeedHQ, The Old Reader, Inoreader, BazQux Reader, Newsblur, Feed Wrangler, FreshRSS, Miniflux, Nextcloud News, Tiny Tiny RSS."

The App lets you subscribe and organize your news feeds, which will be updated fully automatically, so you always have the latest news available within the App. All articles will presented for a comfortable reading experience, but of course the original web view is also available.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLegi is special among RSS readers, because it has a speech output feature. This means the App can read all articles aloud when you can not read these yourself, for example when driving a car, while doing sports and for many other activities where you can't look on your device. The App has a full-featured audio player for the speech output (Play/Pause, skip back/forward, a timeline etc.) which works similar to the one of a music player App. Of course, all remote controls for music (the one from the control center, headphones, or Apple Watch) will work for Legi as well, so Legi can be in the background as well.\n\nThe full text of all articles will be presented in a comfortable reading mode, for which you can configure colors, fonts, text size etc. to match your own preferences. \n\nAn offline mode makes it possible to read all articles even if no internet connection is available. In addition the App lets you configure when and under which conditions the data is loaded, so you can load most or all of the data using WiFi and less or no data in mobile networks to avoid traffic.\n\nYou can also create \"smart playlists\" to categorize and organize articles independently of the feeds.\n\nSeveral 3rd-party services to manage your feeds are supported as well: \n- FeedWrangler\n- Feed HQ, FeedBlur\n- FeedBin\n- BazQux\n- InoReader\n- The Old Reader\n\nAlso feeds can be saved as favorites, you can export or import your feeds via OPML, you can share articles using the ShareSheet and much more.\n\nThe Watch App lets you read or listen to (via speech output) articles on your Apple Watch as well. This is great for all the occasions where you do not have your iPhone with you, for example for all kinds of sports activities"

In order to accomplish this, we start at the very root: the design! We believe in delivering the best viewing experience which is why we have absolutely no ads! We also pride ourselves on our minimal design, obstructing all distraction. Most importantly, we believe in delivering experience possible so you can digest information with no interruptions at all.\n\nNext comes the information. We ask you to tune your interests so that you can see news articles based on your interests. However, Views isn't just another news reading application. In order to help you stay up to date in your busy lives, we utilize artificial intelligence to analyze a news article and present you with an informed summarized version. Of course, not all of us have the time to read at our own pace which is why we give you the option of saving articles offline so you can read them at a later date.\n\nAnother great way to stay updated is to tune in to your favorite podcasts. WIth Views 4, we introduce an all-new podcast player designed only for you. You can save your favorite podcasts and download individual episodes for offline listening. Whether you're driving or simply prefer an auditory experience over a visual experience, we've made sure to help you. \n\nFinally, all this information means we need a great way to organize and search through it. Once again, we've relied on machine learning for this task. Rather than fine-tune every aspect of your search, simply search using natural language. For example: \"Search all podcasts for latest news\" or \"Display the top technology news\" gives you just that. Nothing that you wouldn't expect.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThere's a lot of noise in today's social medias and it can be hard to determine what's true and what's fake. We decided we had enough of the shouting matches online so we take very great care in sourcing our articles from reliable sources (powered by NewsAPI).\n\nIn a world where the news we receive can be questionable and sometimes opposing, Views  4 wants to present information with beautiful clarity, both visually and audibly, so what are you waiting for? Download the best news app today!"

      "label": "Songbot is a powerful tool that can search every radio station in the world for the song you want to hear. Just type in the song name or artist you want and start listening immediately. Or choose from a list of currently playing songs from your favorite genre.\n\nNo subscription fees. No ads between stations. No hidden fees or trial periods. Songbot makes tens of thousands of radio stations into one mega searchable jukebox with none of the stuff you dislike from other music apps. It even shows you the song history of your favorite FM/AM radio stations, so you can find out what you just heard.\n\nUltimate Song Finder\nSearch for a song and listen to it right now. Our songbots are actively searching over 90,000 (AM/FM/Internet) stations and finding out what they’re playing in real-time. Tell your personal Songbot what you want to hear, and it'll find the station that's playing the song right now. No more waiting for your favorite song to come on.\n\nAll Your Local AM/FM Radio Stations\nSongbot will give you all of your local AM/FM radio stations as well as the ones slightly further away from your radio's reception reach all in high quality. You can even enter another town's zip code to get stations playing in another city.\n\nListen to Today's Most Played Songs\nSongbot will also list the most played songs over the last 48 hours on radio, and then let you listen to them instantly. Songbot even lists the top songs by genre, so there's something for everyone.\n\nView a Station's Song History\nSongbot lets you see all the songs you just listened to, so you can listen to them again at anytime. You can even see what was playing in the past few hours on any station and be able to start listening to any of those songs listed. It's almost like rewinding a radio station.\n\nPlay YouTube Videos with the Screen Off\nSongbot not only gives you the music videos to the songs you want to hear, you can turn off the screen and continue playing the audio by simply pressing the power button twice, and then pressing Play. You can also use other apps while the audio plays in the background.\n\nSmart Favorites\nYou can save the song, artist or station as part of your favorites, so you can always get to what you want with just one tap. We also keep track of your song history for you, so you can always find that song that you just heard but forgot to add to your favorites.\n\nFind Stations Similar to Your Favorite\nIf you have a favorite AM/FM radio station, Songbot can help you find similar ones from around the world. The great thing is that you don't have to be near them to listen to them. Songbot connects you to them through the internet. And since it's only audio, it will use less bandwidth than listening to a song on a video website. It also doesn't have to do all that buffering that a video website would have to do. The songs play almost instantly.\n\nDiscover New Stations\nTired of the same stations you've already heard on your car radio? In Songbot 2.0, we've included premium stations. Now you can find stations that are playing music that you otherwise wouldn't find in your car stereo system. For example, perhaps you like K-Pop, Anime, or Cinematic music. Perhaps you want a station that only plays Eminem songs. We have that for you!\n\nRadio Talk Shows and Sports Included\nNo matter if you're looking for Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, Rachel Maddow, or NPR; Songbot will find a station for you that's playing their talk show. Want to listen in on the latest game? Songbot will help you find a station that's broadcasting it live.\n\nAdvanced Recommendation Engine\nWant to find other musicians similar to your favorite band? Use Songbot's advanced recommendation engine to pick out radio stations for you based on your favorite artists. Or you can just start listening to a station, and Songbot will suggest other stations to listen to that play similar music. Discover new music this way. It's also good for skipping around when a commercial comes on on your current station."

Find out how close and how big it was with iFeltThat, the most customizable worldwide earthquake app for the iPhone and iPod touch.\n\niFeltThat retrieves information directly from official USGS sources to show you seven days of microquake activity as low as magnitude 1.0 in most U.S. regions. Earthquake lists for U.S. regions show you precisely where an event occurred (not just \"Northern California,\" but \"5 mi SE of Santa Rosa, CA\"). Rotate any list view to see the region-wide map. You can also see at a glance how many citizens reported the event to the USGS \"Did You Feel It?\" service\n\nIn addition to 20 region-specific event listings around the world (visit support page for a complete list), iFeltThat features a Nearby region, which uses your current location as a center point. Add an unlimited number of center points from your Address Book to keep an eye on seismic activity near your family and friends (or your own hometown while you travel) down to magnitude 1.0 in the U.S. (4.5 elsewhere). Or set a center point from any event location around the world to monitor earthquake swarms within 500 miles of the center point.\n\nView single-event and interactive region-wide maps in roadmap or satellite hybrid styles. All maps are pinch-zoomable and draggable, just like the Maps app. Optional one-touch zoom buttons in detail maps let you zoom in and out quickly for one-handed operation while on the go. Tap the Newer and Older buttons to navigate instantly from quake detail to quake detail without having to go back to the list.\n\nWhenever a ••USGS Shake Map•• is available for an event, a special icon appears in that event's detail view. Tap the icon to see the Shake Map within iFeltThat. In fact, all related web pages (including direct access to North American and Pacific/Indian Ocean ••Tsunami Warnings••) appear inside the app. Also from inside the app, send an email with info, links, and a screenshot of an event detail screen/map to anyone you like.\n\nCustomize which four regions are ready to view at a single tap on the bottom bar. For each region list, set the minimum magnitude threshold and default map zoom level.\n\nOne earthquake may have brought you to iFeltThat. You'll be so intrigued monitoring unexpected earth movements near you and around the world that you may find yourself using IFeltThat more often than you check the weather or news."

If you only want to view technology without the politics, you can. Only interested in sports? There's an option for that too. Ruby has options for what you can view on your feed.\n\nRuby also offers bookmarks, so you can find an article and come back to it later. We also offer customization. You can easily change the country you're in, or the language you prefer to read. \n\nThe built in news reader is easy to understand, and provides content from your favorite websites, but without the advertisements and other nonsense.\n\nRuby also offers an Apple Watch app, where you can quickly view headlines on your wrist. The Apple Watch app has the same functionality as the iPhone app, so you can easily read headlines of a specific topic, and more.\n\nIf you want to suggest features for Ruby, contact us on Twitter @RubyNewsApp. We're open to suggestions, and want to create the best user experience possible!"

Now you can hear it all right as it happens around you or from around the globe.\n\nWhy spend hundreds of dollars on an old-fashoned police scanner that will only receive local frequencies, when Action Scanner can tune you in to over 6,600 feeds worldwide?\n\nWith so many feeds to choose from, it would be crazy to expect you to pick just one. That's why we've designed Action Scanner PRO to automatically scan up to 6 feeds simultaneously and seek out the action in real time. No other IOS scanner application can offer that!\n\nOur top-of-the-line scanner offers the features that you want most:\n\n    * Scan up to SIX stations at once - An Action Scanner Exclusive!\n    * Scan in the background - Action Scanner continues to run while you use other apps or play music or games\n    * Find the most popular scanner feeds by state, county or world-wide\n    * Organize your favorite feeds into banks and switch between them instantly\n    * Find the active feed at a glance on the integrated map\n    * Configure the sleep timer and listen to the action as you fall asleep\n    * Beautiful user interface optimized for the Retina display\n    * Extensive coverage of Police, Fire, Emergency Services, Aircraft, Railroad, Amateur Radio Repeaters and more!\n\nPlease note that like all of the scanner apps in the App Store our feeds are provided over the Internet by individual volunteers, and we can't add or guarantee the availability of feeds for any particular area. We are confident that you will find plenty of information and entertainment regardless. If your locality isn't listed, consider becoming a feed provider - information is available at www.radioreference.com. This application and those like it in the App Store do not allow you to receive police radio frequencies directly on your device."

Germany\n\nEasy navigation:\nDrag left, right, up and down for nearby pages. Use \"Back\" button for previously visited pages. Click page links or tap the page number field at the top to enter page number manually. All sub pages displayed below first page. Use system settings to change start page and other preferences. Supports landscape mode.\n\nShortcuts:\nFive configurable shortcut buttons for channel and page. Reconfigure by holding on the button for 3 seconds.\nYou can swipe the page number at the top to go to a predefined page. Use settings on your home screen to configure. Default all swipes go to page 100.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nSome channels have a time at the top that is not the same as when viewed on a TV. This time reflects the time the page was changed. So you may think you read old news but it is the latest available on internet and the same as on TV.\n\nPlease note:\nThis is only a specialized web browser and relies on publications on the internet. This means that channels may disappear at any time. \nRequires OS 6.0 or later."

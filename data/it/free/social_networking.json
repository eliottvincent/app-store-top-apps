      "label": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nApple Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

To offer the widest range of features and up-to-date technology the app has been updated more than 60 times in the past 3 years and we will continue to do so.\n\nYou only need to scan a QR code and then you can:\n\n- access all of your WhatsApp chats (and group chats)\n- enjoy VOICE MESSAGES (SEND + RECEIVE)\n- reply to chats via KEYBOARD, QUICK REPLIES, DICTATION and SCRIBBLE\n- use a VARIETY of different KEYBOARD LAYOUTS*\n- watch VIDEOS\n- see STATUS UPDATES (TEXT, PICTURE, VIDEO)\n- view STICKERS and HD PICTURES (and ZOOM into them in native resolution)\n- CUSTOMIZE your quick replies\n- start a new chat right from the Watch\n- set each chat's font size\n- …\n\n... all with full respect to your privacy, WatchChat does not collect any personal data.\n\n*The currently supported keyboard layouts are:\n\n- FlickType (English)\n- ABC (English, Deutsch, Español, Português, אבגדה, Ελληνικά, Suomi, русский)\n- QWERTY (English, Español, Italiano)\n- QWERTZ (Deutsch)\n- AZERTY (Français)\n- אבגדה)עברית)\n\n\n\nSetting up the app for the first time only takes 4 simple steps:\n\n- open the app on your Apple Watch\n- open WhatsApp\n- in WhatsApp, go to (Settings) > (Linked Devices / WhatsApp Web) > (Link a device)\n- scan the QR code that will appear on your Apple Watch after 10-30 seconds\n- if a popup comes up, just try again, it will work out eventually :)\n\n\nAs this is a 3rd-party-app, I would really appreciate if you had suggestions for further development so I can take your ideas into consideration. If you encounter issues while using the app, don't hesitate to contact me, I am more than happy to help.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that, as the app isn’t officially affiliated with WhatsApp, available features and functionality are subject to change. To keep up with everything, the app has been updated more than 70 times since its release in 2017 - I am always looking for ways to offer new features or improve the existing ones.\n\n\nYou can use the app for free forever, but if you want to support the app's further development, the \"Support WatchChat Development\" subscription CAN be purchased for free users to access the \"Contacts\" and \"Status\" sections and will grant access to future additions. After the free trial period, if offered, the subscription automatically renews with the price and duration given in the purchase button unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. YOU CAN MANAGE AND CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS BY GOING TO YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE APP STORE AFTER PURCHASE. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\n\nAs of January, IF you want to sign up for the subscription, the free trial period is 3 days, it is billed annually and the price is about the equivalent of 3 USD.\n\n\nTerms of use: https://watchchat.info/terms.html"

Send and receive high-fidelity messages, participate in HD voice/video calls, and explore a growing set of new features that help you stay connected. Signal’s advanced privacy-preserving technology is always enabled, so you can focus on sharing the moments that matter with the people who matter to you.\n\n• Say anything – State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption (powered by the open source Signal Protocol™) keeps your conversations secure. Privacy isn’t an optional mode — it’s just the way that Signal works. Every message, every call, every time.\n\n• Go fast – Messages are delivered quickly and reliably, even on slow networks. Signal is optimized to operate in the most constrained environment possible.\n\n• Feel free – Signal is a completely independent 501c3 nonprofit. Development is supported by users like you. No advertisements. No trackers. No kidding.\n\n• Be yourself – You can use your existing phone number and address book to securely communicate with your friends.\n\n• Speak up – Whether they live across town or across the ocean, Signal’s enhanced audio and video quality will make your friends and family feel closer.\n\n• Whisper in the shadows – Switch to the dark theme if you refuse to see the light.\n\n• Sound familiar – Choose custom alerts for each contact, or disable noises completely. Simon & Garfunkel wrote a hit song about it in 1964, and you can experience the sound of silence whenever you want by choosing “None” as your notification ringtone.\n\n• Picture this – Use the built-in image editing features to sketch, crop, and flip your outgoing photos. There’s even a text tool so that you can add more words to the 1,000 that your picture is already worth.\n\n\nFor support, questions, or more information, please visit:\nhttps://support.signal.org\n\nSource code:\nhttps://github.com/signalapp\n\nFollow us on Twitter (@signalapp) and Instagram (@signal_app) for all of the latest updates and announcements."

Whether it's your closest friends planning casual get-togethers or larger groups attending public events, this is your place to plan it all. NOW is used as a tool for the everyday to remind people of the simple pleasures and what keeps us present. \n\nSome features to mention:\nCreating your clique - A clique is a group of people who come together based on common interests and the desire to hang out with one another. There are no right or wrong ideas - the clique is yours and the community will follow. \nOpening hangouts - Hangouts are events that get published in a clique, bringing everyone together in real-life. For example, create a volleyball clique and open a hangout to arrange a game. The clique will then be notified to join in. \nCreating lineups - Use lineups to share places you’ve been and discover others.  Lineups are personalized lists people create to share their favorite spots and save places to visit. \n\nAfter downloading the app, it's time to create your first clique and invite your friends to join! \n\nFeel free to reach out to us at info@nowhangouts.com with any questions, suggestions, or feedback you have! \n\nThink offline, think NOW."

      "label": "Tumblr. Pure effervescent enrichment. Old internet energy. Home of the Reblogs. All the art you never knew you needed. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up. \n\nOh, and influencers? Don’t even go here. Every video you find, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate, every waterfall GIF you secretly gaze at in wonder—that’s all you. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Welcome to weird. Make it yours. \n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is. \n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. Tumblr is the home of all things weird and wonderful, funny and fascinating—old-school internet vibes. We’re built a little different, just like everyone else who goes here.\n\nYour dashboard will become the place to see what you want to see: a chronological tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, reblog and add your own take, this is your universe to discover, express, and enjoy. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here.\n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world, F1 fanfic that your mutuals need to see—you have so many options. Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. You can make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. Don’t say we don’t spoil you!\n\nThe reblog starts conversations in which anyone can join. Reblogging creates jokes and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post only for a couple of your friends to engage with? All possible here). No matter who you are, where you are, or what you are (looking at you here, Pikaman), this is your space—with as much freedom or privacy as you need. \n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. Maybe you have a favorite blorbo from your show? There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3, *and* see their OC art on Tumblr, *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? You get the idea: it’s all here. Wait. Frogs. Did we mention the frogs? \n\nIt’s a whole world out here. If the prospect of reblogging, shipping, curating, and fanart feels a little daunting, or you simply require a refresher on how all this works, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart’s content. Or simply drift through the dream you’ve created for yourself—a chronological dashboard curated by you. For you. You hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service"

      "label": "L'APP Tucum nasce sull'esempio della tradizione partenopea del caffè sospeso che consiste nell'offrire un caffè al bar e un amico o una persona più bisognosa. \n\n\r\n\r\nI principi del caffè sospeso, dunque, sono quelli del DONO e della RECIPROCITÀ che si esprimono attraverso gesti di condivisione e di gratuità.\n\n\r\n\r\nTucum incarna questi valori e li trasmette nella società andando a realizzare “L'economia sospesa” dove tutto (beni e servizi) può essere donato in favore di chi vive in situazioni di povertà.\r\n\r\n\nL'APP diventa così uno strumento innovativo a servizio della carità, andando a contrastare legati ai falsi poveri e al racket dell'elemosina.\r\n\r\nFINALITÀ DEL PROGETTO TUCUM\r\n\r\n\nA. Accompagnare in un percorso di promozione umana chiunque viva in condizioni di estrema povertà (i Beneficiari del Progetto) Tessere a tecnologia NFC (contactless) con la quale possono ritirare dagli shop convenzionati (Partner del Progetto) ciò di cui hanno veramente bisogno. Il ritiro dei prodotti e l'accesso ai servizi avviene in modo semplice e dignitoso;\r\n\r\n\nB. Contrastare il fenomeno dei falsi poveri e del racket dell'elemosina, agli utenti Donatori la possibilità di compiere gesti di carità in maniera rapida, trasparente e sicura;\r\n\r\n\nC. Sostenere l'economia locale;\r\n\r\n\nD. Sostenere progetti di promozione umana in Italia e nei Paesi in via di sviluppo, a favore di Enti no profit (Associazioni, Caritas, Istituti religiosi, parrocchie, ecc ...); \r\n\r\n\nE. Sostenere avviare e la formazione al lavoro attraverso micro-prestiti a tasso zero in favore di soggetti svantaggiati cosiddetti \"non bancabili\".\r\n\r\n\nCOME FUNZIONA IL PROGETTO\r\n\r\n\n1. Gli utenti donatori possono donare attraverso carte di credito o prepagate a partire da 0,20 € e, grazie alla modalità di pagamento di OneClick, la donazione avviene in pochi secondi.\r\n\r\n\n2. I Donatori possono scegliere l'Ente no profit da sostenere visualizzando in anteprima, in modo chiaro e trasparente, la ripartizione della donazione.\r\n\r\n\n3. In base all'ammontare delle donazioni ricevute, l'Ente potrà individuare i Beneficiari e assegnare loro le Tessere per il ritiro dei prodotti direttamente dai Partner.\r\n\r\n\n4. Le Tessere presentano un Chip che dialoga con l'APP e scambia le informazioni utili per ritirare i prodotti.\r\n\r\n\n5. Le Tessere non contengono denaro, ma crediti. Sono personali e, al momento del ritiro dei prodotti, mostrano la foto del Beneficiario per impedire eventuali abusi.\r\n\r\n\n6. Nel caso di abusi o per altre necessità, l'Ente può sospendere immediatamente o rimuovere definitivamente la Tessera al Beneficiario.\r\n\r\n\n7. Per ritirare i prodotti è sufficiente che il Partner faccia passare la Tessera vicino al cellulare e selezioni i prodotti scelti dal Beneficiario. Potranno essere ritirati solo prodotti ritenuti sani (NO alcol, NO tabacchi, ecc…).\r\n\r\n\n8. I prodotti inseriti dal Partner (il quale per iscriversi NON può avere installato all'interno del suo locale apparecchi da gioco come Slot Machine e VLT), sono ad un prezzo convenzionato e questo rende le donazioni maggiormente efficaci. \r\n\r\n\nNb \r\nLa “Tucum-OdV” è l'organizzazione di volontariato iscritta al n.ro 2289 del Registro Generale del Volontariato Pugliese a cui vengono inviate le donazioni che saranno ripartite ai vari Enti scelti dal Donatore. \r\n\r\n\nCon Tucum gli effetti delle tue donazioni sono moltiplicati in modo rapido, trasparente ed ingegnoso."

No matter what you’re into, you can meet passionate people posting about it on Mastodon!\n\nJoin a community and create your profile. Find and and follow fascinating folks and read their posts in an ad-free, chronological timeline. Express yourself with custom emoji, images, GIFs, videos, and audio in 500-character posts. Reply to threads and reblog posts from anyone to share great stuff. Find new accounts to follow and trending hashtags to expand your network.\n\nMastodon is built with a focus on privacy and safety. Decide whether your posts are shared with your followers, just the people you mention, or the whole world. Content warnings let you hide posts containing sensitive or triggering material until you're ready to engage with them. Each community has its own guidelines and moderators to keep its members safe, and robust blocking and reporting tools help prevent abuse.\n\nMore features:\n\n• Dark Mode: Read posts in light, dark, or true black mode\n• Polls: Ask followers for their opinion and tally the votes\n• Explore: Trending hashtags and accounts are a tap away\n• Notifications: Get notified about new follows, replies, and reblogs\n• Sharing: Post directly to Mastodon from any share sheet in any app\n• Cuteness: Our mascot is an adorable elephant, and you'll see them pop up from time to time\n\nMastodon is a registered nonprofit and development is supported directly by your donations.

      "label": "Nano Hotel Booking - is an application for receiving orders and booking rooms in hotels, recreation centers, health centers, guesthouses. \nAlso, it can be used for daily, hourly, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly renting of real estate, vehicles, construction machinery and any other objects. Application’s versatility makes it suitable for services reservation, for example, at hair salons, car workshops, gyms etc. \n\nThe application is fully compatible with the desktop version (Nano Hotel Booking for OS X).\n\nPrinciples of operation\nThe application is based on a calendar registering the statuses of the hotel rooms (objects). The calendar displays the state of a hotel room on any day of the month. In the hourly rent mode there is a separate calendar for one day divided into 5, 10, 15, 30 or 60 minutes. \nBooked days are highlighted with pink color. For each free day, the room rate is given with regard to seasonal prices. \nTo book a room you need to create an order for this room while specifying the term and the type of a rent. An order can be tied to the client book, or you can simply enter client’s name and phone number directly to the order card. \nYou can book a free room straightforward from the calendar. You can open an order card or a room card from the calendar with one click. Rooms can be made unavailable, for example, for the period of renovation. Rooms and orders can also be labeled with colored tags in order to show their current status.\n\nPricing\nIn a room (object) card you can specify the price and the cost of one day of rent. If you have a lot of rooms, it will be more convenient to create price lists in the settings and tie rooms to them. \nYou can specify daily, hourly, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly prices in the price lists separately. \nYou can enter season prices for each room. Season prices can be tied to the price lists. \nIt is possible to add additional options to each order, such as food, excursions, transfers. There is an indication of each option’s price, as well as whether the price depends on the number of days and the number of guests. \nAn account of the room appliances is kept, i.e. refrigerator, TV, telephone set and so forth.\n\nTypes of rent\n\nDaily\nThis is the main mode of the application. The value of an order is calculated as the price per day multiplied by the number of days or nights, depending on the application settings (see “Settings” – “My Profile”).\n\nHourly\nThe value of an order is calculated as the price per hour multiplied by the number of hours of rent (can be specified accurately to within 5 minutes).\n\nWeekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly\nIn these modes (cyclic orders), the value is calculated as the price per one period (week, month, quarter or year) multiplied by the number of periods that have begun. Let us demonstrate you this through an example. Let’s say the monthly rent is 100 and let’s say today is June 30th. Let’s create an order from July 1st to August 31st with a monthly rent type. In this example, the order amount on June 30th will be 0, as the rent starts only since tomorrow. The order amount on July 1st will be 100. On August 1st the order amount will increase by 100 and will equal 200. On September 1st the amount will not change, as the order ends on August 31st. \nYou can stop a cyclic order at any moment. For this purpose, there is a button “Close cyclic order” in an order card. It will set the order amount equal to the sum of money actually received and the end date to the day of an order closure. \n\nIn all types of rent, the value of options is added to the order amount."

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "SalesCalc is designed to help you to create irresistible deals\n- quickly \n- efficiently\n- accurately\nwithout having to remember formulas and equations\n\nAnyone can use it - it's really so simple.\nAll you need is an iPhone.\n\nIf you need to calculate:\n- Gross Margin\n- Markup %\n- Percent Change\n- Percent Total\nthen SalesCalc is the App for you. \n\n\nMost people in sales and purchasing rely on their favorite spreadsheets when they want to calculate margins, markups or discounts. Some folks have memorized the formulas and use a calculator for the task but we think that the iPhone presents an easier way to get the answers you need to close a deal quickly. Instead of having to remember formulas - you'll never make a mistake with SalesCalc.\n\nSalesCalc will deliver your answer in under a second, all you need to do is input numerical values into 2 of the 3 fields. To clear the fields, just shake the iPhone.\n\nSalesCalc puts a few of the most commonly used sales related calculations in the palm of your hand so the next time you are in deal making mode - reach out for SalesCalc and put together the best deal ever.\n\nHere's to your Sales Success... \n \n\nSome Definitions:\n- Gross Margin is the percentage of the selling price that can be applied toward covering your operating costs and profit. Basically, 20% gross profit margin means that for every dollar generated in sales, you have 20 cents left over to cover basic operating costs and profit. \nLarger gross margins are generally good for companies, with the exception of discount retailers which need to show that operation efficiency and financing allows them to operate with smaller margins. Since the Margin is the percentage of the price that is markup, it can never exceed 100%\n\n- Cost of Goods Sold includes variable and fixed costs directly linked to the product, such as material and labor. It does not include indirect fixed costs like office expenses, rent, administrative costs, etc.\n\n- Markup also known as Cost-Plus-Markup or Markup by Cost is the difference between the selling price and the cost divided by the cost of goods sold expressed as a percent. The initial markup of a retail product is also known as IMU. \n\n- Markdowns or Discounts are used to generate sales and or clear inventory and are usually expressed as a percentage of the Original Price.\n\n- Initial pricing is an extremely important step in merchandising. For retailers that use a traditional calculation, such as Keystoning, which is doubling cost to arrive at the selling price (100% IMU = 50% profit margin), this may or may not be adequate to be profitable, particularly after markdowns are taken. In reality, there are numerous examples of products that cannot be sold profitably, but need to be in the store to satisfy Customer needs. Therefore, other products need to be sold at higher MU%'s to cover the net losses of the products that lose money. SalesCalc gives you a few ways to price your products so that you can calculate your profitability using the method that best fits your business model."

The stunning 3D robot can chat with you, answer detailed questions and can guide and help you. \n\nThe knowledge base behind the app contains 'Wolfram Alpha', which gives you an enormous amount of information in your pocket. \nWith Voice Answer, you have full and unlimited access to this knowledge. \n\nExamples of topics and specific questions and commands: \n\nText: 'Send text to George I will be late' \n\nEmail: 'Email John Let's get together this week.' \n\nCall: 'Call mom' \n\nTranslation: 'Translate I would like to go now into Spanish' \n\nPlay songs on your device: 'Play music by Adele' \n\nReminder: 'Set reminder to 5 pm' \n\nSocial media: 'Post to Facebook This is great', 'Tweet I am going home now' \n\nSearch: 'Google this','Wiki that' \n\nLocation: 'Where am I?' \n\nPlaces: 'Where is the nearest bank?' \n\nMathematics: 'Integrate sin x dx from x=0 to pi' \n\nUnits & Measures 'U.K. men's size 11 shoe in Japanese size' \n\nMoney & Finance 'What is the Apple stock price' \n\nDates & Times 'What is the current time in Tokyo?' \n\nCurrent Weather 'What will be the high temperature today?' \n\nHealth & Medicine 'What is the life expectancy of a U.S. female age 30?' \n\nPlaces & Geography 'Where is ZIP 60637?' \n\nSocioeconomic Data 'Compare the age pyramid of New York and Miami' \n\nPeople & History 'When did Gandhi die?' \n\nFood & Nutrition '2 slices of swiss cheese' \n\nPhysics: 'What is the speed of light?' \n\nMaterials: 'Show me Topaz' \n\nEducation: 'How many kids are repeating primary school in California?' \n\nCulture & Media: 'US constitution' \n\nOrganizations: 'New York University' \n\nAstronomy:'Star chart' \n\nTransportation: 'Compare total length of all roads in USA and China' \n\nWords & Linguistics: 'Show me words that rhyme with bear' \n\nEarth Sciences: 'When was the Jurassic Period?' \n\nLife Sciences:'Compare puma, lion, red fox' \n\nSports & Games:'San Francisco Giants' \n\nWeb & Computer Systems: 'What is the cheapest tablet?' \n\nColors: 'What do you get when you mix red and blue' \n\nThe answers are spoken out, and relevant images are given. \n\nYou can also just have a general chat with Eve. Test her witty personality or just ask her to tell a joke or two. \n\nCommon Questions and concerns: \n\nQ: Why do I get strange answers to my question? \nA: Voice Answer will first check it's knowledge servers, including Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha's award winning service, for an answer. If these don't respond, either because the answer is unavailable or the servers are down, the chatbot will answer the question. These answers are generally more funny than useful. You can avoid strange answers by disabling the chatbot, and try your question later. We are further enhancing our current data sources with additional databases as these become available, as we want to offer our customers the very best. \n\nQ: What do I do when voice answer doesn't understand my voice? \nA: Voice Answer compares your voice against a database of spoken english words and sentences. It works better for some people than for others. In general it works better than the voice recognition used by many other apps, but it depends on your accent. Try to speak slow and use regular sentences. If this doesn't work, you can use the keyboard. As and when better voice recognition algorithms are developed and become available, we can and will plug these in. \n\nQ: The app crashes. What can I do? \nA: On some devices such as the iPad1 or 3GS, it may sometimes be required to do a hard reset to get it to work. If this fails, removing the app and installing it again will generally get it going. We are working on improving the stability on those devices. \n\nPlease contact us at support@sparklingapps.com for any questions or comments. If you have any problems with any of the functions of the app, we can assist you with it. We are proud of our product and want our customers to get the most out of it."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

Una volta selezionato il pulsante “Dizionario” potrai scegliere se digitare la parola in italiano nella barra di ricerca e visualizzare il video del segno corrispondente, oppure, selezionando “Ricerca alfabetica” potrai scegliere una lettera e consultare l'elenco alfabetico delle parole in italiano. Cliccando sulla parola si attiva il filmato del segno corrispondente. \n\nI lemmi a cui è associata una frase di contesto sono evidenziati con il colore arancione.\n\nSotto al video sono riportate tutte le informazioni supplementari: frase (se collegata al vocabolo scelto), altri significati, eventuali note, sinonimi e varianti relativi al vocabolo cercato.\n\nI segni sinonimi sono ordinati secondo il grado di diffusione della variante. Sono riportate anche alcune varianti regionali dei segni più conosciuti.\n\nL'ultimo riquadro include le traduzioni della parola italiana in lingua straniera (inglese, francese, tedesco e spagnolo). \n\nUsare questa applicazione è veramente molto facile e ti permette di portarla sempre con te, sul tuo dispositivo mobile preferito, e di consultare il Dizionario ovunque!\n\nBuon viaggio nel mondo della LIS!\n\nwww.lismedia.it\n\nwww.euromediaitalia.com"

Say the word in the conjugated form indicated.\n(2) Tap the sound icon to check whether you said the conjugated form correctly.\n(3) Tap the ＊ icon to check the conjugated form in writing.\n(4) Study the use of the conjugated form by referring to the example sentence and illustration on the back side of the card.\n(5) Tap the Rule icon to see the conjugation rule.\n\nCheck: Test your retention of each conjugated form by typing in your answers.*\n(1) Type in the conjugated form as instructed.\n(2) If you entered the correct form, the card will be removed from MyDeck. Cards answered incorrectly or skipped will remain in the deck for further practice.\n*To study with the Check method, you will need to add a Japanese keyboard to your iPhone settings before starting.\n\nHandy features\n•Menu\nThe study selections are grouped together in a single menu to allow you to practice more efficiently. \n\n•List\nAll conjugation forms of each word are listed in this feature, with the words arranged in a-i-u-e-o order. A check mark is displayed next to each conjugation form that has been mastered and the MyDeck card for each entry can be opened, allowing you to review the conjugations via the list.\n\n•Rule\nThis feature lists the rules for all 28 conjugation types covered by the app, enabling you to quickly look up the way to form conjugations such as the passive, the causative, the causative passive, and the tricky te-form.\n\n•MyDeck Shuffle Mode\nActivating this mode will cause the app to display the MyDeck cards in random order, rather than the default order. Shuffling the deck will help you to more firmly master the material.\n\n•Tutorials\nThe tutorials provide helpful lessons on how to add a Japanese keyboard and operate each function. \n\n—This app is based on the second edition of GENKI.\n—Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Can you tell the difference between excitement and fear, or between aggression and the need to play?\r\n\r\nDog language can be confusing, but with the help of Dog Decoder, you’ll understand your dog’s signals like a pro.\r\n\r\nDog Decoder will teach you everything you need to know about how your dog communicates, so you can not only avoid bites, but share in a more satisfying, healthy, and loving relationship.\r\n\r\n=== MEET “DIAMOND” === \r\n\r\nDiamond is your tour guide and trainer. He will show you how he looks when he’s afraid, when he’s stressed, when he’s just about to bite, and when he wants to play. \r\n\r\n=== DOG POSTURES ===\r\n\r\nThere are about SIXTY different poses on display in Dog Decoder. Each pose is beautifully and expressively illustrated by one of the world’s top dog artists.\r\n\r\nEach pose comes with a diagram, pointing out where on Diamond’s body he’s indicating how he’s feeling. For example, in the poses for “fear,” the diagram will point out Diamond’s tucked tail, his ears pulled back, etc. We won’t just show you a picture of a scared dog — we’ll teach you what to look for, the signs of fear.\r\n\r\nEach pose also comes with a helpful description of the context. This is where you will learn about some common misconceptions, or what kinds of situations will cause your dog to assume each posture.\r\n\r\n=== TEST YOURSELF! ===\r\n\r\nThe best way to see how much you’ve learned is to take the quiz! Some of the quiz questions are pretty challenging. Diamond wants to make sure you don’t get fooled next time he’s hiding under the coffee table or drooling – will you recognize the early warning signs of stress? Will you be able to warn your children when your dog is clearly done playing?"

Learning and understanding how electrons orbit an atom is precisely one of those topics.  From the same team that brought you Atomic Orbitalz, the highly successful orbital visualizer, Orbitalz AR is the world’s premiere augmented reality atomic orbital visualization app.  Using high definition, three-dimensional models, Orbitalz AR allows the user to view and explore every type of electronic atomic orbital for a hydrogen atom, putting each of the orbitals right there in the room with you!  A perfect textbook companion, this app allows the user to walk around and view the shapes of the orbitals from any angle as well as superimpose the orbitals within a family to see how their positions in three dimensions interact with each other.  Orbitalz AR includes the s orbital, three p orbitals, five d orbitals, and seven f orbitals.  If you’re a chemistry student or just interested in how atoms are put together, then Orbitalz AR is for you!"

      "label": "L’APP Bibbia di Gerusalemme nasce per offrire a tutti una nuova esperienza di lettura della Sacra Bibbia. Unica e inconfondibile, tradotta in tutte le lingue del mondo cristiano, la Bibbia di Gerusalemme è universalmente la più diffusa. Per il rigore degli studi è la più amata dai credenti, la più consultata dagli esperti, la più frequentata dal pubblico laico.\nLe varie parti che costituiscono La Bibbia di Gerusalemme concorrono insieme a farne un’opera unica nel suo genere.\nI rimandi ai versetti di altri libri della Bibbia (passi paralleli) sono di supporto all’approfondimento e alla dilatazione del testo letto: vengono usati come suggeritori di un senso che potrebbe sfuggire.\nLe note chiave costruiscono un percorso tematico all’interno di tutta la Bibbia, favoriscono una visione sintetica e d’insieme tra tutti i libri che formano l’Antico e il Nuovo Testamento, evitano che il lettore si perda nel particolare del singolo libro e lo accompagnano a capire che la Bibbia è un libro composto da tanti libri.\nNell’edizione italiana, tali note sono state ulteriormente ampliate per fornire elementi che aiutino la comprensione delle scelte operate dalla nuova traduzione della CEI (2008), che costituisce il testo biblico. Merito della nuova edizione della Bibbia di Gerusalemme è la grande attenzione con cui accoglie i mutamenti intervenuti negli studi biblici lungo i 50 anni che separano dalla nascita dell’opera. I commenti consentono infatti di individuare i filoni su cui esistono tra gli studiosi sensibilità e posizioni rinnovate. Le note critiche evidenziano e cercano di risolvere i problemi storici, filologici, di trasmissione testuale, per poi affrontare i nodi culturali e teologici con grande interesse alle odierne ricerche sul linguaggio.\nL’applicazione sfrutta queste caratteristiche proprie della Bibbia di Gerusalemme, offrendo la possibilità di annotare alcuni passi inserendo un commento personale, creare percorsi tematici visitando i vari passi paralleli, consultare durante la lettura le note dei versetti o semplicemente salvarne uno nell’apposita sezione dei segnalibri.\nLe xilografie, riprodotte da una Bibbia del 1606 stampata “apud Iuntas” a Venezia (e precisamente dalla terza edizione di questa, del 1625), impreziosiscono l’app e costituiscono un vero commento visivo, che si svolge in parallelo a quello letterario e teologico.\nLa veste grafica è stata realizzata con particolare attenzione alle tematiche di usabilità e accessibilità dei contenuti. La struttura di navigazione è stata progettata per fornire all’utente un’informazione completa, ponendo le sezioni principali accessibili da qualsiasi\ninterfaccia.\nLa navigazione superiore permette di effettuare una ricerca nel capitolo che si sta leggendo o in tutta la Bibbia. A fianco alla ricerca, troviamo le impostazioni del lettore. Da qui sarà possibile modificare graficamente l’interfaccia, così da rendere la lettura più leggera secondo le proprie esigenze.\nSelezionando un versetto qualsiasi del capitolo, verranno presentate all’utente diverse interazioni quali la possibilità di salvare il versetto nei segnalibri, aggiungere una nota personale o semplicemente effettuare una condivisione. I versetti annotati e i segnalibri saranno accessibili dalla navigazione inferiore. Da qui inoltre è possibile passare al capitolo successivo o al precedente in qualsiasi momento. E’ inoltre accessibile la sezione della cronologia che rende visibile il percorso di lettura dell’ultima settimana.\nDalla sezione degli appunti, l’utente potrà creare inoltre dei veri e propri taccuini. Al loro interno potrà andare ad inserire delle note personali indipendenti dalla lettura e i segnalibri dei vari versetti, così da categorizzare alcuni passi particolari secondo i propri criteri\npersonali."

Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

      "label": "We received the \"Editor´s Choice\" award by Apple for \"Little Fox Animal Doctor\" And in addition our app was awarded the \"Tech with Kids' Best Pick Award\" for exceptional design of a children's app. \n\nLittle Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4. Little Fox Animal Doctor is the first 3D-App by Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger. She is also the creative genius behind Nighty Night, Little Fox Music Box and Nighty Night Circus. Her Apps have been downloaded over 5 million times worldwide.                                                                                                                                  \n\nThe App will make your children’s dreams of being an Animal Doctor come true!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years.

Tic Toc Time for iPad and iPhone is the world’s first time-telling app that teaches children aged 5-8 how to read a clock face using elements that they’re already deeply familiar with: sun, shadow, night and day. \n\nEXPERT-CRAFTED \nOnce the foundation is laid, children are taught how to read a clock face and tell time via a simple, easy and fun learning path that was crafted in conjunction with renowned Swiss astrophysicist Slim Hamdani. \n\nMEETS ACADEMIC STANDARDS \nTic Toc Time meets the Common Core State Standards for mathematics, including standards for telling time in grades 1, 2, and 3. And because it’s so much fun, children won’t even realize that they’re learning! \n\nCREATE MULTIPLE PROFILES \nTic Toc Time lets you create up to 40 unique profiles for all of the young learners in your life. It’s ideal for school use, home use, while in transit/traveling, or anywhere else! \n\nEASY SETTING MANAGEMENT \nYou’ll find it easy and simple to manage all of Tic Toc Time’s settings, including text, audio, sounds and AM/PM or 24-hour mode. \n\n> Secure gaming environment: No ads, no external links, no in-app purchase, no social media access, no personal information request \n> 11 languages: French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean \n\nREVIEWS \n\"But still, each lesson is important in learning and understanding time. This is by far the most comprehensive time-telling app on the market.\" \n- Smart Apps For Kids \n\n\"Tic Toc Time is more than just an app that lets juniors learn about the time of day. It's a discovery game that lets you discover what makes our day it is. It's one of the best science-themed apps for younger juniors on the App Store. I'd highly recommend it for juniors who are learning how to tell the time.\"\n- Geek with Juniors \n\nCONNECT WITH US! \nIf you have any support requests, please write us at support@edokiacademy.com or visit Edoki Academy Online Community at edokiacademy.com."

The picture becomes a media to exercise touching. The action of touching images while simultaneously listening and singing, can thus reinforce this valuable learning tool. The illustrated animals in the story become the visual representation of a precise syllable and can express a name, a sound or a character’s nature. Also, many moments of everyday life are associated to the animals so that every child can recognize them in contest and therefore empathize and feel more involved.\n\n• 19 stories to read or listen to\n• Interactive secrets on each page\n• 19 original sing along songs\n• 19 fun interactive games to learn and have fun\n• Optimized for iPad"

      "label": "Imparare ad associare suoni e sillabe... è un gioco! \nUsala con i tuoi bambini, sarà bello esplorare l'alfabeto in un modo tutto nuovo e naturale!! \n\n- Più di 100 parole da imparare\n- Un percorso di apprendimento strutturato su 5 livelli progressivi di difficoltà\n- Un set di impostazioni che permettono al genitore di guidare l'attività di apprendimento del bambino\n- Un metodo innovativo che parte dalla comprensione dalle sillabe: primo naturale codice fonetico dei bambini\n- Abbicì è stato creato pensando ai bambini: non ci sono punteggi, fallimenti, limiti o stress. I bambini possono giocare ad Abbicì in piena tranquillità e con i loro tempi.\n \nC'è un momento nell'infanzia dei bambini, intorno ai 2-3 anni, in cui cominciano ad esprimere un interesse particolare per la lettura e la scrittura, perchè capiscono quanto questo sia importante per gli adulti e li vogliono imitare. \n\nÈ il momento in cui cominciano a scarabocchiare dei segni incomprensibili sulla carta e a pronunciare a voce alta quello che pensano di scrivere. La collana Abbicì di Koo-koo Books vuole accompagnare proprio questo momento specifico della crescita linguistica del bambino, per aiutarlo a scoprire le sillabe e poi parole che prendono vita\ne “si fanno imparare\" grazie all'aiuto delle figure, dei suoni e del gioco interattivo. \n\nUn'applicazione educativa sintonizzata sull'istintiva volontà del bambino di capire l'alfabeto che facilita l'apprendimento, lo sviluppo della loro autonomia, la fiducia in sé stessi, senza sfide, senza punteggi, senza stress e delusioni, ma nel pieno rispetto dei tempi di apprendimento del bambino.\n\nA differenza di molte applicazioni che supportano la lettura e la scrittura prescolare a partire dai singoli segni e suoni dell'alfabeto, Abbicì propone un metodo innovativo che parte invece dalle sillabe che sono il primo e naturale codice fonetico dei bambini fin dai loro primi anni di vita: dall'ascolto e dalla ripetizione delle lallazioni verbali, attraverso l'associazione di questi fonemi con le sillabe del parlato adulto fino ad arrivare alla costruzione delle parole e del loro significato. \n\nL'applicazione propone alla base un percorso di apprendimento suddiviso su 5 livelli progressivi di difficoltà: dalla costruzione e comprensione di parole semplici a due sillabe, fino alla composizione di parole a quattro sillabe con consonanti doppie e suoni più complessi. Il genitore può gestire l'apprendimento del bambino selezionando dalle Impostazioni il livello più adeguato alle competenze linguistiche dei propri figli e da lì procedere gradualmente verso i livelli successivi. \n\nIl gioco è semplice e intuitivo: il bambino può scorrere orizzontalmente con le dita sullo schermo più di 100 schede colorate ognuna delle quali rappresenta la figura di un animale e la parola che lo identifica, della quale viene enunciata la divisione in sillabe evidenziando la porzione della parola e il suono corrispondente. Il bambino deve scegliere dai menu a scorrimento le sillabe che nella giusta sequenza compongono il nome dell'animale raffigurato, associando i segni ai diversi suoni.\n\n\"Abbiccì degli Animali\" è il primo titolo della collana di app \"Abbicì\" by Koo-koo Books."

Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation.

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

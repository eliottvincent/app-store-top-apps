      "label": "L’APP Bibbia di Gerusalemme nasce per offrire a tutti una nuova esperienza di lettura della Sacra Bibbia. Unica e inconfondibile, tradotta in tutte le lingue del mondo cristiano, la Bibbia di Gerusalemme è universalmente la più diffusa. Per il rigore degli studi è la più amata dai credenti, la più consultata dagli esperti, la più frequentata dal pubblico laico.\nLe varie parti che costituiscono La Bibbia di Gerusalemme concorrono insieme a farne un’opera unica nel suo genere.\nI rimandi ai versetti di altri libri della Bibbia (passi paralleli) sono di supporto all’approfondimento e alla dilatazione del testo letto: vengono usati come suggeritori di un senso che potrebbe sfuggire.\nLe note chiave costruiscono un percorso tematico all’interno di tutta la Bibbia, favoriscono una visione sintetica e d’insieme tra tutti i libri che formano l’Antico e il Nuovo Testamento, evitano che il lettore si perda nel particolare del singolo libro e lo accompagnano a capire che la Bibbia è un libro composto da tanti libri.\nNell’edizione italiana, tali note sono state ulteriormente ampliate per fornire elementi che aiutino la comprensione delle scelte operate dalla nuova traduzione della CEI (2008), che costituisce il testo biblico. Merito della nuova edizione della Bibbia di Gerusalemme è la grande attenzione con cui accoglie i mutamenti intervenuti negli studi biblici lungo i 50 anni che separano dalla nascita dell’opera. I commenti consentono infatti di individuare i filoni su cui esistono tra gli studiosi sensibilità e posizioni rinnovate. Le note critiche evidenziano e cercano di risolvere i problemi storici, filologici, di trasmissione testuale, per poi affrontare i nodi culturali e teologici con grande interesse alle odierne ricerche sul linguaggio.\nL’applicazione sfrutta queste caratteristiche proprie della Bibbia di Gerusalemme, offrendo la possibilità di annotare alcuni passi inserendo un commento personale, creare percorsi tematici visitando i vari passi paralleli, consultare durante la lettura le note dei versetti o semplicemente salvarne uno nell’apposita sezione dei segnalibri.\nLe xilografie, riprodotte da una Bibbia del 1606 stampata “apud Iuntas” a Venezia (e precisamente dalla terza edizione di questa, del 1625), impreziosiscono l’app e costituiscono un vero commento visivo, che si svolge in parallelo a quello letterario e teologico.\nLa veste grafica è stata realizzata con particolare attenzione alle tematiche di usabilità e accessibilità dei contenuti. La struttura di navigazione è stata progettata per fornire all’utente un’informazione completa, ponendo le sezioni principali accessibili da qualsiasi\ninterfaccia.\nLa navigazione superiore permette di effettuare una ricerca nel capitolo che si sta leggendo o in tutta la Bibbia. A fianco alla ricerca, troviamo le impostazioni del lettore. Da qui sarà possibile modificare graficamente l’interfaccia, così da rendere la lettura più leggera secondo le proprie esigenze.\nSelezionando un versetto qualsiasi del capitolo, verranno presentate all’utente diverse interazioni quali la possibilità di salvare il versetto nei segnalibri, aggiungere una nota personale o semplicemente effettuare una condivisione. I versetti annotati e i segnalibri saranno accessibili dalla navigazione inferiore. Da qui inoltre è possibile passare al capitolo successivo o al precedente in qualsiasi momento. E’ inoltre accessibile la sezione della cronologia che rende visibile il percorso di lettura dell’ultima settimana.\nDalla sezione degli appunti, l’utente potrà creare inoltre dei veri e propri taccuini. Al loro interno potrà andare ad inserire delle note personali indipendenti dalla lettura e i segnalibri dei vari versetti, così da categorizzare alcuni passi particolari secondo i propri criteri\npersonali."

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

The picture becomes a media to exercise touching. The action of touching images while simultaneously listening and singing, can thus reinforce this valuable learning tool. The illustrated animals in the story become the visual representation of a precise syllable and can express a name, a sound or a character’s nature. Also, many moments of everyday life are associated to the animals so that every child can recognize them in contest and therefore empathize and feel more involved.\n\n• 19 stories to read or listen to\n• Interactive secrets on each page\n• 19 original sing along songs\n• 19 fun interactive games to learn and have fun\n• Optimized for iPad"

      "label": "Imparare ad associare suoni e sillabe... è un gioco! \nUsala con i tuoi bambini, sarà bello esplorare l'alfabeto in un modo tutto nuovo e naturale!! \n\n- Più di 100 parole da imparare\n- Un percorso di apprendimento strutturato su 5 livelli progressivi di difficoltà\n- Un set di impostazioni che permettono al genitore di guidare l'attività di apprendimento del bambino\n- Un metodo innovativo che parte dalla comprensione dalle sillabe: primo naturale codice fonetico dei bambini\n- Abbicì è stato creato pensando ai bambini: non ci sono punteggi, fallimenti, limiti o stress. I bambini possono giocare ad Abbicì in piena tranquillità e con i loro tempi.\n \nC'è un momento nell'infanzia dei bambini, intorno ai 2-3 anni, in cui cominciano ad esprimere un interesse particolare per la lettura e la scrittura, perchè capiscono quanto questo sia importante per gli adulti e li vogliono imitare. \n\nÈ il momento in cui cominciano a scarabocchiare dei segni incomprensibili sulla carta e a pronunciare a voce alta quello che pensano di scrivere. La collana Abbicì di Koo-koo Books vuole accompagnare proprio questo momento specifico della crescita linguistica del bambino, per aiutarlo a scoprire le sillabe e poi parole che prendono vita\ne “si fanno imparare\" grazie all'aiuto delle figure, dei suoni e del gioco interattivo. \n\nUn'applicazione educativa sintonizzata sull'istintiva volontà del bambino di capire l'alfabeto che facilita l'apprendimento, lo sviluppo della loro autonomia, la fiducia in sé stessi, senza sfide, senza punteggi, senza stress e delusioni, ma nel pieno rispetto dei tempi di apprendimento del bambino.\n\nA differenza di molte applicazioni che supportano la lettura e la scrittura prescolare a partire dai singoli segni e suoni dell'alfabeto, Abbicì propone un metodo innovativo che parte invece dalle sillabe che sono il primo e naturale codice fonetico dei bambini fin dai loro primi anni di vita: dall'ascolto e dalla ripetizione delle lallazioni verbali, attraverso l'associazione di questi fonemi con le sillabe del parlato adulto fino ad arrivare alla costruzione delle parole e del loro significato. \n\nL'applicazione propone alla base un percorso di apprendimento suddiviso su 5 livelli progressivi di difficoltà: dalla costruzione e comprensione di parole semplici a due sillabe, fino alla composizione di parole a quattro sillabe con consonanti doppie e suoni più complessi. Il genitore può gestire l'apprendimento del bambino selezionando dalle Impostazioni il livello più adeguato alle competenze linguistiche dei propri figli e da lì procedere gradualmente verso i livelli successivi. \n\nIl gioco è semplice e intuitivo: il bambino può scorrere orizzontalmente con le dita sullo schermo più di 100 schede colorate ognuna delle quali rappresenta la figura di un animale e la parola che lo identifica, della quale viene enunciata la divisione in sillabe evidenziando la porzione della parola e il suono corrispondente. Il bambino deve scegliere dai menu a scorrimento le sillabe che nella giusta sequenza compongono il nome dell'animale raffigurato, associando i segni ai diversi suoni.\n\n\"Abbiccì degli Animali\" è il primo titolo della collana di app \"Abbicì\" by Koo-koo Books."

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

Sotto la guida di un simpatico pirata, il bambino affronterà le attività immerso in una divertente caccia al tesoro.\nAll'interno dell'area \"Statistiche\" è possibile monitorare l’andamento del bambino e verificare i progressi fatti, visualizzando i risultati ottenuti in ciascuna sessione di lavoro.\nL’app può essere inoltre sincronizzata con la versione \"Insegnante\", per condividere i percorsi creati dal docente durante l'attività scolastica e proseguire l'allenamento a casa."

Say the word in the conjugated form indicated.\n(2) Tap the sound icon to check whether you said the conjugated form correctly.\n(3) Tap the ＊ icon to check the conjugated form in writing.\n(4) Study the use of the conjugated form by referring to the example sentence and illustration on the back side of the card.\n(5) Tap the Rule icon to see the conjugation rule.\n\nCheck: Test your retention of each conjugated form by typing in your answers.*\n(1) Type in the conjugated form as instructed.\n(2) If you entered the correct form, the card will be removed from MyDeck. Cards answered incorrectly or skipped will remain in the deck for further practice.\n*To study with the Check method, you will need to add a Japanese keyboard to your iPhone settings before starting.\n\nHandy features\n•Menu\nThe study selections are grouped together in a single menu to allow you to practice more efficiently. \n\n•List\nAll conjugation forms of each word are listed in this feature, with the words arranged in a-i-u-e-o order. A check mark is displayed next to each conjugation form that has been mastered and the MyDeck card for each entry can be opened, allowing you to review the conjugations via the list.\n\n•Rule\nThis feature lists the rules for all 28 conjugation types covered by the app, enabling you to quickly look up the way to form conjugations such as the passive, the causative, the causative passive, and the tricky te-form.\n\n•MyDeck Shuffle Mode\nActivating this mode will cause the app to display the MyDeck cards in random order, rather than the default order. Shuffling the deck will help you to more firmly master the material.\n\n•Tutorials\nThe tutorials provide helpful lessons on how to add a Japanese keyboard and operate each function. \n\n—This app is based on the second edition of GENKI.\n—Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

Your goal is to help Munchy catch each note as quickly as possible. \n\nThe game combines learning and fun into a single gratifying experience. The app is both educational and entertaining, with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. \n\nNoteWorks was created for: \n• iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n• Players of all ages. \n• Beginners to advanced music students. \n• Families with multiple players. \n• Music teachers with multiple students. \n\nGame design features include: \n• A funny animated character. \n• User-friendly menus. \n• Superb graphics. \n• Engaging sound effects. \n\nNote reading options: \n• On-screen piano keyboard input.\n• On-screen guitar fretboard input.\n• MIDI keyboard input.  \n• \"A, B, C\" note naming:\n. . . CDEFGAB\n. . . CDEFGAH\n. . . ABCDEFG\n. . . AHCDEFG \n• \"Do, Re, Mi\" (Fixed Do) note naming. \n• Treble clef. \n• Bass clef. \n• Tenor clef. \n• Alto clef. \n• Custom note range in all four clefs.\n\nEducational features: \n• Students learn by playing and having fun. \n• Multiple game settings allow players to stay in control. \n• Students can choose to play with hints. \n• Students play without hints to earn points and stars. \n• Players learn to recognize notes instantly, on sight. \n• For beginners, the game starts by teaching a limited range of notes. \n• Note range can be easily customized as students advance. \n• After mastering accidentals, students learn key signatures. \n• Game speed is controlled to increase or decrease difficulty, or students may choose to play without any time limit.\n• Sharing of game progress: ability to share game results with teachers.\n\nWhile music teachers persistently stress the importance of sight reading, most teachers prefer not to spend valuable lesson time on basic note recognition skills. Thus, NoteWorks helps music teachers concentrate on more interesting aspects of their art, such as technique and musicality. \n\nSerious music students can take advantage of the game to learn clefs outside of their own instruments, as well as prepare for music theory exams. In addition, non-musicians could use NoteWorks as an interesting memory game, to help keep their minds sharp and quick. \n\nNoteWorks was created for people who like to learn by playing and having fun. It was designed with the objective of neither being too easy nor too hard, and never boring. We hope you'll find NoteWorks both useful and entertaining, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughts and opinions about the game by rating it."

(Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\n・Fun illustrations help users to better retain the words studied. \n・Users can bookmark the words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\n\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\n・Users check their understanding of the vocabulary studied and sort the words into those mastered and those not yet retained.\n・The words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\n\n◇ “List” displays a list of all words covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review the vocabulary.\n・The list can be arranged in any of three orderings: lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, and alphabetical order. The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\n・Checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\n・The Study view of words can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\n\n\n○This app is based on the vocabulary from the third edition of GENKI.\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

You can also pair a camera/imager with a telescope and determine what your camera/imager will see in its frame. This will be a big help for astro-imagers.\n\nThe app computes a number of parameters for your telescope/eyepiece/imager combination, such as magnification, actual field of view, visual magnitude limit, etc. and displays these values in tabular form.\n\nSeveral astronomical catalogues are built in to the app (including Messier, NGC, IC, and many other object catalogues), and will be updated on-line occasionally. Images for these objects can be downloaded. All catalogues can be searched.\n\nThe app contains extensive lists of known vendor-supplied telescopes, camera lenses, eyepieces, imagers, and optical aids. You can also create your own custom entries if your equipment isn't listed (for example, if you made your own telescope). These custom entries are shared between your devices via iCloud (if available)."

      "label": "Learn basic kanji through kanji words:\r\nGENKI Kanji for 3rd Ed. is an app that helps users become able to recognize 317 basic kanji by studying more than 1,100 kanji words at their own pace!\r\n\r\nThis is the official iPhone app from the 3rd edition of GENKI: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese, a best-selling series of Japanese learning materials boasting more than 2 million copies sold.\r\n\r\nAdvantages\r\n◆ Users can view the kanji words as they like, enabling them to study at their own pace.\r\n◆ By repeating a process of memorization and self-checking, learners can master readings of kanji words and recognition of basic kanji.\r\n◆ Audio recordings have been newly added for each kanji word.\r\n◆ Kanji words already mastered are progressively removed from the study set, so users can concentrate on just the kanji that challenge them, making for a more efficient approach to learning.\r\n\r\nStudy methods and functions\r\nThis app has three main modes: Study, Check, and List.\r\n\r\n◇ “Study” allows users to view the kanji words, their readings, and the target kanji for each word over and over, so they can take their time learning.\r\n・Audio recordings of natural pronunciations by native speakers are provided for all kanji words . (Please set your iPhone to Ring mode to hear the audio playback.)\r\n・Basic information on the target kanji is provided with fun illustrations and mnemonic hints, as well as animations of their stroke order.\r\n(The illustrations and hints are taken from the very popular learning resource “Kanji Look and Learn.”)\r\n・Users can bookmark the kanji words they like. The bookmarked words are compiled in the Bookmark list in \"List.\"\r\n\r\n◇ “Check” helps learners to track their mastery.\r\n・Users check their understanding of the kanji words studied and sort them into those mastered and those not yet retained.\r\n・The kanji words already mastered are taken out of the study set, leaving behind just those that still need to be worked on.\r\n\r\n◇ “List” displays various lists of all the words and kanji covered by the app so that users can see their progress and review them.\r\n・In the lists arranged in lesson order, a-i-u-e-o order, or alphabetical order, checkmarks are automatically placed next to words that have been mastered.\r\n・Kanji information on the cards can be displayed from the entries in the On/Kun list.\r\n・Users can search kanji words from their target kanji in the Serial # list.\r\n・The words bookmarked in the Study mode are also listed in the Bookmark list.\r\n・The Study view of kanji words or the target kanji can be displayed from the list entries, enabling quick review.\r\n\r\n○This app is based on the kanji list from the third edition of GENKI.\r\n○Ads: The app does not display any ads that might interfere with learning."

      "label": "PitchBop is a melodic ear training app designed to help you improve the connection between your ear and your instrument by directly linking the level of skill to the accuracy of your performance.\n\n\nWHAT PITCHBOP DOES DIFFERENTLY\n\nUnlike most ear training apps where you answer by tapping on a screen without addressing the rhythmic aspect of what you hear, PitchBop offers a performance-like scenario where you listen and actually play your instrument or use your voice.\n\nUsing the 'Call and Response' model, Dr. Bop, the resident jazz cat of PitchBop, plays a short phrase for you to listen to and allows you the same amount of time to repeat the phrase back to him to evaluate the accuracy of your performance.\n\n\nHOW PITCHBOP WORKS\n\nBehind the simple interface, there is a complex algorithm based on AI which creates endless melodies and adjusts the difficulty according to your progress.\n\nUsing the 'Call and Response' model, Dr. Bop plays a short phrase for you to listen to and allows you the same amount of time to repeat the phrase back to him to evaluate the accuracy of your performance. Once the session is complete, you receive feedback on how well you did, and the difficulty level is set based on your performance so you can focus on playing without needing to worry about adjusting the settings.\n\n\nAPP FEATURES\n\n+ Pitch Complexity\n\nPitchBop creates calls with varying levels of pitch complexity on a scale of 1 to 9. Use this slider to set the complexity level.\n\n+ Rhythmic Complexity\n\nUse this slider to set the rhythmic complexity level between 1 and 9.\n\n+ Choose Your Instrument\n\nTap the instrument name to see a list of instrument choices, then tap the name of your instrument to automatically set your available range. PitchBop can be used with a wide variety of instruments, including your voice.\n\n+ Metronome Settings \n\nSet the metronome volume and choose if you want it to give you all four beats, one and three, two and four, or whichever combination of beats you prefer.\n\n+ Profile Tab\n\nVisit the Profile Tab to study your progress. This information is only stored for Dr. Bop’s Game, however, not for Practice Mode.\n\nAdditional details can be found by tapping the up and down arrows next to “Scale” to select the various scale and harmony types PitchBop uses for the calls and it will report the success rate and the Pitch and Rhythmic Complexity in your most recent “Call-and-Response” session.\n\n+ Practice Mode settings\n\nPitch Complexity\nRhythmic Complexity\nTempo\nScale\nRange\nAlways start on root on/off\nNumber of calls per session\nSwing/Even\nChromatic notes on/off\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL GAME DETAILS BEFORE YOU START \n\n1. Pay attention to the octave \n\nYour response must be in the same octave as Dr.Bop’s Call in order for it to be registered accurately. If it isn’t, even if the note is correct, you will see a lower score due to the incorrect octave. \n\nExample: For level 1 (when both sliders are all the way to the left) the starting note for the piano is C4 (the middle C). For the guitar, it is C4 as well (first fret on the B string or 5th fret on the G string)\n\n\n\n2. Pay attention to the rhythm\n\nWhile the app may be called PitchBop, rhythm is still a big part of the game. Users should make sure to pay attention to the rhythm and try to be as accurate as they can in matching it. Responses played out of rhythm will lower your score. \n\nIf the Calls feel a little too challenging, you can move the sliders all the way to the left and try starting from there. If this still feels like more than you’re comfortable with for now, you also have the option to go to the “more” tab and adjust the range to be as narrow as an octave.\n\n\n3. Bluetooth and external devices\n\nDue to the diverse and often unpredictable nature of external devices, PitchBop is designed to use the device’s microphone and speaker. \nBluetooth compatibility, however, will be addressed in a future update.\n\nFor any other questions please contact us at support@pitchbop.com"

Grammar is useful but not so important. Children do not know grammar but understand and speak very well. So the main idea is to listen and listen to the same English stories or dialogs 50-100 times for several days. At the beginning you can only listen, then listen and follow the text by eyes. \r\n \r\nAfter you listened to the dialogs a lot of times you need to start repeat after the native speaker. The best way to learn is to record yourself and compare your voice with an original native speaker. You should repeat more and more to memorize words and improve your pronunciation.\r\n \r\nIt is better to learn new English words by looking at real high-quality pictures. Then you can play quizzes to memorize more and more words by playing.\r\n\r\nMain features of  English Speaking and Listening application:\r\n\r\n- Listen to English stories and dialogs for any level\r\n- Speak, record your voice and compare with an original native speaker\r\n- More than 250 most common stories and conversations\r\n- More than 25 most common topics\r\n- More than 1500 most common words with pictures\r\n- Easy, medium and difficult levels\r\n- Show and hide the translation of dialogs and words \r\n- Sentences are highlighted following the audio\r\n- Add audio to the Favorites playlist\r\n- Mark audio as a learned by a green tick\r\n- Fun games to memorize words by pictures\r\n- All audios work without internet\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn English and speak English fluently is to practice listening and speaking English. It will help you speak English like native speakers and understand them.\r\n\r\nThank you very much and good luck to you!\r\n\r\n(Ages 4+)"

      "label": "Highly acclaimed in its four print editions, Bryan A. Garner's Garner's Modern English Usage is now available on your iPhone and iPad. This extraordinary reference tool contains over 8,000 entries and essays that reflect usage lexicography at its finest. Designed with the mobile user in mind, Garner's Modern English Usage is searchable, eminently navigable, and fully citable.\n\nGMEU is the liveliest and most compulsively readable reference work for writers of our time. It delights while providing instruction on skillful, persuasive, and vivid prose. Garner liberates English from two extremes: both from the hidebound \"purists\" who mistakenly believe that split infinitives and sentence-ending prepositions are malfeasances and from the linguistic relativists who believe that whatever people say or write must necessarily be accepted. \n\nThe judgments here are backed up not just by a lifetime of study but also by an empirical grounding in the largest linguistic corpora ever available. Garner has made extensive use of big data to include ratios of standard terms as compared against variants in modern print sources. No other resource provides as comprehensive, reliable, and empirical a guide to current English usage. \n\nIf you're concerned with writing and editing, GMEU will prove invaluable to you. Garner illustrates with actual examples, cited with chapter and verse, all the linguistic blunders that modern writers and speakers are prone to, whether in word choice, syntax, phrasing, punctuation, or pronunciation. No matter how knowledgeable you may already be, you're sure to learn from every single entry of this resource.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Easy-to-use search tools bring up words effortlessly\n* Voice search finds what you're looking for without having to type\n* Text is citable\n* Favorites feature to create a custom list of words \n* Usage quizzes test your knowledge with questions written by Bryan Garner"

It’s the kind of thing you can imagine a science teacher using in the classroom of the future — except that we don’t have to wait.” - CNet\n \n“Zoom from Mercury to Pluto (which makes the cut in this app), passing each planet’s moons along the way. Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation. Turn into an astronomer and explore planets, moons, satellites, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, stars and other celestial bodies. Enjoy gorgeous graphics and visuals while navigating through the solar system!\n\n► Make virtual flights from one space object to another.\n\n► Travel in time and see what the universe and our Solar system looked like at a certain period.\n\n► Find an exciting view of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n► Watch a collection of educational solar system movies to learn about space-related topics including Earth's moon phases, Earth's cycles, tidal phenomena, and zodiacal constellations.*\n\n► Enjoy 3D planetarium with the help of special glasses and activating the anaglyph mode.\n\n► Share interesting screenshots of the app with your friends.\n\n► Choose the view mode comfortable for you (orrery/true-to-scale).\n\n*Available through In-App Purchases.\n\nSolar Walk is a great educational tool appropriate for both adults and children. The amount of information users can learn about the planets, moons, satellites and other celestial bodies is impressive. Information is age appropriate, detailed and animated video clips make learning our solar system even more engaging!\n\nThe entire Solar system can be explored with Solar Walk app!"

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

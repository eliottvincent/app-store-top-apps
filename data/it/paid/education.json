      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.\n\nThere are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe\n\nSome kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

Its going tibia ok, the Skelly app is just what you need! With the Skelly app you can literally pull the inspiration you need right out of your pocket anywhere, anytime!\n\nSkelly is a fully poseable, anatomically correct reference skeleton for artists. A simplified version of the skeleton is also included, named “Robo-Skelly”. These figures were created to make the study of anatomy easier and more enjoyable for students and professionals without leaving your wallets bone dry. They can also be used to inspire poses for drawing, painting, sculpting, illustration, animation, comics, manga, storyboarding, twerking, and to fully understand the anatomy of the human skeleton. No need for super gluteus, Skelly comes pre-assembled and ready to pose as soon as you launch the app! \n\nLearning the structure of the human body is the skeleton key to drawing the figure in an anatomically correct manner without having to clear your browser history to avoid awkward conversations with your loved ones. Whether you want to make works like Michelangelo or Miyazaki, Skelly will help you focus on your art and let you personalize his poses, rather than searching for reference material and hiring models. Learn to draw the skeleton from any angle without the inconvenient and morally questionable need to go grave robbing.\n\nFEATURES:\n \nAnatomically correct skeleton\nSimplified “Robo Skelly”\nProportions based on the teachings of Dr. Paul Richer\nSkull fits perfectly into a “Loomis Head” as taught by Andrew Loomis\nPoseable joints\nPose Library - choose from pre made poses and save your own\nMovable camera\nAdjustable light source\nChoose light or dark background\nReset to neutral “Anatomical Pose”\n\nPEOPLE LOVE IT:\n\nJames Gurney, author of ‘Color and Light’ and ‘Imaginative Realism’ Says:\n\n\"Bend him, twist him, contort him! The Skelly app lets you put a virtual human skeleton into any pose, and to see him from any angle, and in any lighting. It’s a great tool for art students or professionals wondering what the skeleton is really doing beneath a life pose, or for anyone wanting to visualize a pose from scratch. The interface is intuitive to learn and easy to use, without sacrificing any of the nuances of the human body’s complex range of movement. Skelly is a big improvement over the old wooden mannikin.\"\n\n- Chris Oatley, Director Of The Oatley Academy Of Visual Storytelling Says:\n\n\"Skelly is the fastest, most fluid anatomical reference I have ever seen. I was shocked at how easy it is to pose the figure and direct the light source. Finally! It’s the app visual artists have been waiting for.\"\n\nHave any questions? CONTACT US:\n\nskelly@proko.com"

      "label": "Every musician should work on Ear Training (or Aural Training) and Interval Ear Training is a very important element of ear training. To put it very simply, you will learn to recognise the relationship between two notes (by distance), when they are played together or apart!\n\nThere are two types of interval listening, harmonic and melodic. In harmonic intervals the notes are played at the same time and in melodic the notes are played one after the other. Easy to remember: Melodic Intervals make melody, Harmonic Intervals make harmony!\n\nMany of you will probably want to understand how the names are found and how to work out the interval note names in every key. For this info you probably want to check out my ebook Practical Music Theory (available from justinguitar.com) which will explain all the theory related to this.\n\nThis app deals specifically with Interval Ear Training, both melodic and harmonic. It will start very easy and gradually get harder as you get more correct and can pass each stage. You can choose from Piano or Guitar Input for your answers, and you can chose to hear the notes and guitar or piano. Personally, I'd recommend getting used to both. In \"Training Mode\" you can select specific intervals to work on if you are struggling with just specific intervals or types of interval.\n\nI'm sure you'll find this app very helpful, all you need to add is practice time! \n\nBest wishes, Justin"

      "label": "Даже если ваш ребенок только начинает учиться читать и первый раз видит буквы. Или если ваш ребенок знает буквы и перед вами стоит задача объяснить ему, как их превратить в слова. Или у вас уже почти читающий дошкольник, которому надо подтянуть и закрепить навык. Во всех этих случаях вам подойдет ЧИТАНИЯ.\n\nПотому что это увлекательное путешествие героев по волшебной стране, с приключениями и миссией – спасти ее от злого волшебника. А справится с ним сможет тот, кто умеет читать!Ребенку интересно играть и проживать эту историю. Вместе с вовлекающим сюжетом в приложение встроен весь необходимый для освоения чтения материал. Начиная от букв до чтения фраз – все есть в ЧИТАНИИ.\n \nЗа время игры ребенок увидит, услышит и напишет:\n● более 500 иллюстрированных и озвученных слов \n● прочитает и отгадает 65 загадок\n● прочитает 68 поговорок\n● сыграет в 35 игр, развивающих различные навыки чтения \n● пройдет 30 тематических экранов долины Слов с разными уровнями сложности\n● начертит буквы 330 и более раз (печатный и прописной вариант)\n\nВы уже пробовали учить ребенка читать? Если да, тогда вы знаете, как это трудно. Ребенок путает буквы и звуки. Не может прочитать слово, хотя знает буквы, не может прочитать фразу, не понимает смысла.Теряет интерес...\nДля усвоения нужна тренировка. Именно этим занимается ваш ребенок в ЧИТАНИИ. Каждая из 35 мини-игр доводит нужный навык до автоматизма, а интересный сюжет способствует тому, что ребенок снова и снова возвращается в ЧИТАНИЮ и играет на новых, более сложных уровнях.\n\nВ ЧИТАНИИ 5 локаций – буквы, письмо, склады и «автоматизация чтения» – беглое чтение слов, фраз. Информация подана всеми возможными для восприятия способами – визуальным, аудиальным, игровым. Ребенок запоминает увиденное, развивает внимательность и наблюдательность. Улучшает речь за счет развития фонематического слуха и складового написания слов.\n\nОдна из трудностей у детей, когда они учатся читать – слияние букв в слова. Это объяснено в приложении анимацией и игрой. \n\nВ ЧИТАНИИ используется складовая методика обучения чтению (кубики Зайцева). Ее особенность в том, что ребенок быстро начинает читать, запоминая структурные единицы слов – склады. Чтение по складам отрабатывается в ЧИТАНИИ в локации «город Складов»\n\nПосле того, как ребенок освоил буквы и склады, важно как можно больше читать. Практика важна каждый день. В ЧИТАНИИ ребенок читает постоянно, начиная с простых слов. Постепенно сложность увеличивается, но ребенок прочтет все 500 слов, распределенных по темам и заданиям. Кроме обязательного материала, для прочтения в игре доступно более 3000 слов.\n\nЧИТАНИЯ – игра длительного прохождения. Обычно путь ребенка к вершине чтения и победе над злым волшебником занимает от месяца до года. У каждого ребенка свой путь и время. Не торопите события, лучше понаблюдайте, как он проходит игру. Порадуйтесь его успехам!\n\nУникальный обучающий алгоритм ЧИТАНИИ анализирует успехи ребенка, подбирает подходящий уровень заданий и игр. Поэтому, хотя оптимальный возраст для игры 4-6 лет, многие задания будут по силам даже трехлетнему малышу, который только начинает учиться читать, и заинтересуют семилетнего, кому надо подтянуть чтение перед школой. Для продвинутого уровня в настройках можно открыть сразу все разделы игры.\n \nПриложение без встроенных покупок, рекламы и не требует постоянного подключения к Интернету.\n \n● ЧИТАНИЯ - победитель Всероссийского конкурса «Позитивный контент» 2018 г. в номинации «лучшее мобильное приложение»,\n● По заключению Роскачества, ЧИТАНИЯ — лучшая образовательная игра, которая учит чтению, среди всех исследованных приложений на платформе iOS\n● №1 в обзоре SE7EN «5 лучших приложений из App Store для обучения дошкольника чтению»,\n● вошла в топ лучших iOS приложений, публикуемый журналом Лайфхакер.\n\nПрошла пора, когда ребенка надо было заставлять учиться читать. Когда вы придумывали, как же заинтересовать его. \nЧИТАНИЯ увлечет вашего ребенка сказочным сюжетом и научит его читать так, что он полюбит чтение. Попробуйте!"

      "label": "Learn Kotlin Programming for Beginner to Advanced Developer. Master Kotlin Programming and Become a Kotlin Ninja. This is an in depth training to the awesome new programming Language Kotlin, So if you are already a Java developer and thinking of switching to Kotlin for development or you just want to learn this awesome language to increase you skills.\nThis App is going to be your best friend. This app contains all the major topics of Kotlin Programming Language with Code Examples. With its beautiful UI and easy to learn guide you can learn the Kotlin Programming in few Days, and this is what make this app different from other apps. We are constantly updating this app with every new major Kotlin language release and adding more code snippets. \n\nTopics Included in this App:\n- Introduction to Kotlin Programming\n- Kotlin Installation and Environment Setup\n- Learn Kotlin Variables\n- Learn Constants\n- Learn Types\n- Learn Conditional in Kotlin\n- Learn Function\n- Learn about Numbers\n- Learn Strings\n- Learn Null Safety\n- Learn About Exception Handling in Kotlin Language\n- Lambda Expressions\n- Lists and Sets\n- Workin with Maps\n- Functional Programming Basics\n- Scope Functions\n- Learn Classes\n- Class Initialization\n- Inheritance\n- Objects, Data Classes, and Enums\n- Interfaces and Abstract Classes\n- Kotlin Generics\n- Extensions\n- Learn how to work with Coroutines with Kotlin\n- Using Kotlin for Web\n- Kotlin Mircroservices and much much more\n\n\nFew more Reasons to Learn Kotlin Programming Language\n\n1. Kotlin experience is in demand:\n\n2. You’ll develop projects faster:\nKotlin requires fewer lines of code to do the same things as other programming languages. It is an inherently concise language, so can solve many common development problems with just a few lines of code. \n\n3. You’ll improve the quality of the apps you build:\n\nKotlin improves the quality of your released apps through “safety” features that have been designed to reduce the number of bugs and system failures. For example, it has a strong type system based on null-safety. This means by default, variables can’t be null, so you can catch more errors at compile-time before shipping to users. \n\n4. You can use it with existing Java libraries:\n\nKotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, so apps you’ve already built can be migrated to Kotlin incrementally. You don’t need to stop using Java—you can use both! Extension functions give you a way to add functionality to existing classes (even Java classes) without a full rewrite to Kotlin. This means you can take advantage of Kotlin’s powerful features without having to abandon all the skills you’ve gained while building existing apps.\n\nSo if you Like our effort rate this app or comment below if you want to give us any suggestions or ideas.

      "label": "Lo storico DVD del Dizionario Bilingue della Lingua dei Segni Italiana, risultato di più di 10 anni di ricerche da parte di un gruppo di lavoro composto da Mauro Mottinelli, Emilio Insolera ed Elena Radutzky e realizzato nel 2001 da Edizioni Lismedia - Euromedia S.r.l., è finalmente disponibile per i dispositivi mobili più diffusi al mondo.\n\nI segni in movimento è l'unico vero Dizionario che permette la visione della corretta esecuzione di ogni segno e migliora l'apprendimento del lessico in LIS.\n\nIl valore scientifico di questo Dizionario deriva dalla quantità delle informazioni che accompagnano i filmati dei segni: altri significati, eventuali note, sinonimi e varianti relativi alla parola cercata.\n\nA differenza di molti altri prodotti in circolazione – che, anche se gratuiti, talvolta si rivelano solo dei glossari – I segni in movimento e` un vero e proprio dizionario per la quantità e la qualità delle informazioni incluse, che ogni dizionario bilingue dovrebbe contenere: parole equivalenti in lingua italiana, sinonimi e varianti fonologiche in LIS, note che riguardano i contesti d'uso e altre informazioni supplementari.\n\nL'APP è concepita per essere sempre in evoluzione e ampliamento: saranno regolarmente pubblicate numerose appendici di aggiornamento per arricchire ulteriormente l'opera che attualmente contiene oltre 3300 lemmi e oltre 600 frasi per i segni che hanno più di un significato, fornendo i contesti d'uso appropriati.\n \nIn seguito saranno pubblicate regolarmente delle appendici tematiche, indirizzate sia ai bambini che agli adulti.\n\nL'interfaccia dell'applicazione è pienamente accessibile grazie alla doppia funzione di ricerca dei segni. Una volta selezionato il pulsante “Dizionario” potrai scegliere se digitare la parola in italiano nella barra di ricerca e visualizzare il video del segno corrispondente, oppure, selezionando “Ricerca alfabetica” potrai scegliere una lettera e consultare l'elenco alfabetico delle parole in italiano. Cliccando sulla parola si attiva il filmato del segno corrispondente. \n\nI lemmi a cui è associata una frase di contesto sono evidenziati con il colore arancione.\n\nSotto al video sono riportate tutte le informazioni supplementari: frase (se collegata al vocabolo scelto), altri significati, eventuali note, sinonimi e varianti relativi al vocabolo cercato.\n\nI segni sinonimi sono ordinati secondo il grado di diffusione della variante. Sono riportate anche alcune varianti regionali dei segni più conosciuti.\n\nL'ultimo riquadro include le traduzioni della parola italiana in lingua straniera (inglese, francese, tedesco e spagnolo). \n\nUsare questa applicazione è veramente molto facile e ti permette di portarla sempre con te, sul tuo dispositivo mobile preferito, e di consultare il Dizionario ovunque!\n\nBuon viaggio nel mondo della LIS!\n\nwww.lismedia.it\n\nwww.euromediaitalia.com"

      "label": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

      "label": "This Realistic Baby Simulation App will transform the way you play with your Reborn Baby Doll (or other Baby Dolls) forever! \n\nTurn the app on when you are ready to take care of your baby and turn the app off when you are finished caring for your baby. \n\nBabySitMe is designed to replicate an infant simulator when combined with your Reborn Baby. This app is perfect for anyone wanting to have a little extra fun while role playing with their Reborn Baby dolls. While Babysitme is running a schedule, it tells the user to Feed, Burp, Rock and all other necessary actions when really taking care of an infant. These actions are designed to be acted out in role play with the user’s Reborn Baby Doll.\n\nWhen using the app you will be able to choose between Easy, Medium, Hard or Play mode simulations. The Easy, Medium & Hard simulations run on a 24-hour schedule. The Play mode is designed for people that are just wanting a fast-paced version of the app. It is a shortened version of the simulation modes where the care events are very close together and don’t last very long. \nRoutine is categorized in age groups designed to allow you to follow along with your babies routine, There are new care events and even tells you when baby is asleep or awake! \n\n- Name your baby. \n- Realistic 24-hour care schedule, Just like a real baby!\n- Easy for all ages to use (Recommended ages 7+). \n- Bond with your Reborn baby through your baby needing your care and attention.\n- Play schedules for younger children with a shorter attention span. \n- You wont know when your baby will cry for the next care event, making it as realistic as a real baby. \n- Unpredictable care events meaning it isn’t the same old boring Routine every day.\n\n\nThe idea of the app is you place your device next to your Baby Doll and wait for the app to send through a notification sound (cries).  You will need to check the device for what the baby would like, then give the baby doll the correct care\nFor example:\n- Feed baby \n- Burp baby \n- Nappy change \n- Rock baby\n- cuddle baby\n    (Etc…)\n\nWhen the babies care is finished the App will sound again letting you know the care event is finished. Place the device back next to baby and wait for the device to make another sound for the next care event.\nWhen you are finished you simply turn the app off.\n\nThis app has been designed for fun, as a form of entertainment."

Everything is perfect, music selection is great, and pictures are very colorful and baby friendly. Worth every penny!\"\n\n· \"Well done. This is an outstanding app to teach kids about colors. As an adult even I was blown away by how good an app it is.\"\n\nFEATURES: \n· Available in 35 languages!\n· 540 colorful real life pictures.\n· 5 rotating pictures for each item.\n· 44 full classical music pieces.\n· Includes a color-matching game.\n· Discover more features in the settings.\n\n···········································\n\n\"A top app that teaches colors! We the combination of colors and classic music is a great combination that will for sure engage and get all your kids attention.\"\n- http://www.funeducationalapps.com\n\n\"This is a very fun and stimulating educational app and I highly recommend it.\"\n- http://theappreviewer.com/\n\n···········································\n\nIf you have small children that are just starting to learn things like colors, you may be somewhat puzzled as to the best way to go about teaching them the colors of the world. Be puzzled no more, because the best way is with \"Music Color\" for your touch device.\n\n\"Music Color\" is almost alive. It's an incredible combination of a kid-friendly interface, astonishing imagery and classical music. Those three elements combine to produce a spectacular product that is unlike anything else seen on the App Store. \n\nThe sole purpose of this app is to educate. To be more specific, it educates your children in a very specific field – color. What they will see upon opening the app is a palette of colors. Simply tap any one you like and you will dive into the world of that particular color. \n\nLet's take Blue for example. Tap blue and you will see cartoon-style objects that you may associate that color with, like the ocean, or a blue umbrella. There are 9 objects for every color. When you tap each object you will be taken on a journey around the world with spectacular photos of where these objects are found. \n\nNot only will you kids love it, but your jaw will literally drop when you see some of the photos. And for each object, there are 5 photos. So if you do the math, 12 colors, 9 objects per color and 5 photos per object, which equals a staggering 540 incredible photos!\n\nOverall this app will entertain you just as much if not more than your learning child. With so many incredible photos to explore, you’ll love sitting down with your kid to show them what colors are all about. \n\nSee also:\n\n· Sound Touch\n· Sound Touch 2\n· Video Touch - Animals\n· Video Touch - Wildlife\n· Video Touch - Birds\n· Video Touch - Bugs & Insects\n· Video Touch - Vehicles\n· Video Touch - Music\n· The Strawberry Garden"

      "label": "+++ Dyslexia Quality Award Winner 2015 +++ \nThis entertaining and educational matching game app helps you practice your German grammar and spelling in a fun way. Whether you need to brush up on parts of speech, conjugation or declination, tenses and types of sentences - no matter what you need, the various grammatical areas can be combined with each other and practiced. With one click, the appropriate themes are chosen, easy as pie, and you can start right away. Matching pairs must be found, either by purely assigning terms to the proper categories (intelligent = Adjektiv | Ich werde spielen = Futur 1) or as a concentration-enhancing matching game. \n\nTHE GRAMMATIK DUELL HELPS YOU PRACTICE YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN A FUN WAY \nBoth the number of card pairs and the number of players are, of course, variable. Depending on your wishes, the cards can be read aloud, and the length of time in which the cards are revealed is adjustable. The difficulty level of the app increases with the number of card pairs and the chosen area of grammar. It is aimed at all students who are not yet entirely comfortable in their use of grammatical terms or who want to practice for their next grammar lesson in a fun way. You can also work on improving your spelling.\n\nSTRONG MOTIVATION TO LEARN GRAMMAR \nOn your own in a race against time or against a challenging opponent - who will use the fewest number of moves to find the matching pairs? Who will collect the most stars and end up the winner in this grammatical duel? \nThe beautiful visual presentation of the playing cards, the acoustic sounds of success, the pleasing voice that reads aloud, the game variations, the pedagogically sophisticated content and the strict limitations of only relevant content make this app a truly worthwhile learning aid.\nThe Grammar Challenge makes learning grammar fun! \n\nPEDAGOGICAL BENEFITS OF THE APP: \n• Self-explanatory\n• Concentrates on the content without distractions \n• Motivates with a reward system \n• Practice mode\n• Boosts concentration skills\n• Selectable levels of difficulty \n• Selectable number of card pairs \n• Selectable read-aloud function \n• Selectable areas of grammar \n• “Assignable” game variations\n• Beautiful, relevant graphics \n• No in-app purchases \n• No online connection necessary \n• Learning psychology tested and approved \n\nTECHNICAL AND PEDAGOGICAL KNOW-HOW COME TOGETHER IN THE GRAMMATIK DUELL\nThe idea for this app with regard to its content was created by licensed pedagogue Uta Reimann-Höhn (www.lernfoerderung.de), who has published numerous books as an expert on education and upbringing, and who has been the editor-in-chief of “Lernen und fördern mit Spaß!” (“Learn and Grow with Fun!”) since 2006. The idea was implemented by Jan Essig (www.janessig.com), a designer who has made a name for himself with his high-quality educational apps “Adventure Playground” and “Preschoolers ABC Playground” and has won numerous awards."

They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

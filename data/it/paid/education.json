      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

The goal is to solve the puzzles and roll through the end of the maze where a new Thinkroll waits to be unlocked and lead the next quest! \n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nThe app offers 207 clever puzzle levels filled with fun science concepts. Seven playful elements with unique physical properties are gradually introduced. Kids will discover through hands-on manipulation how to use these objects to their advantage and clear a path. \n\n• Cookies • Munch them to clear a path or resist those treats to avoid getting trapped!\n\n• Crates • Push them to fill gaps or stack them to reach higher ground.\n\n• Balloons • Burst them on spikes to get them out of your way.\n\n• Rocks • Get a crash course in Newtonian physics by dropping heavy, dense boulders to break through cracked ground. \n\n• Jelly • Bounce Thinkrolls and objects on springy jellies to launch them up.\n\n• Fire • Use ice blocks to put out the fire and safely pass through. \n\n• Elevators • Timing is added to the mix! Synchronize movements of two different elevators to navigate through the maze.\n\nMASTER THE ART OF THINKING\n\nLittle players will master the art of thinking while using to their advantage force, acceleration, buoyancy, heat, elasticity and gravity to reach the end of the maze. The puzzles gradually build upon successive science lessons to strengthen observation, creative thinking, logic, problem solving, spatial cognition and memory.\n\nThere are unlimited tries and no penalties. Thinkrolls not only challenges the brain but also develops and rewards patience and perseverance. As kids try different combinations to achieve their goal, they intuitively learn through trial and error what works. They must think ahead, use precise timing and rely on their memory to reunite their Thinkroll buddies. \n________________________________\n\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n• 207 levels with mind-sharpening puzzles\n• Easy mode for ages 3-5, hard mode for ages 5-8\n• Hands-on physics lessons\n• Experiment with gravity, heat, buoyancy, speed, elasticity, friction and other science concepts\n• Enhance logic, spatial cognition, problem solving, memory, perseverance \n• 26 hilarious, super smart characters to play with\n• Fun brain training for the whole family\n• Track progress for up to 9 player profiles\n• Supreme design and beautiful artwork\n• Original soundtrack and sound design\n• Language neutral game-play\n• COPPA compliant, no 3rd party ads, no in-app purchases\n\nMore info: avokiddo.com\n________________________________\n\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\nWe respect your privacy!

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Отображается в правом верхнем углу. Означает количество баллов по текущему слову.\n• Процент изученности. Означает процент изученности слов в словаре.\n\nКАК НАЧИСЛЯЮТСЯ БАЛЛЫ\n\nЗа правильный ответ начисляется 1 балл, за неправильный - снимается 2 балла, при просмотре карточки балл не засчитывается.\n\nПервые три балла начисляются при изучении слова, их можно набрать сразу. После этого слово переходит на повтор и баллы по нему не начисляются пока не настанет время повтора.\n\nЧетвертый балл дается при повторе через 1 день.\nПятый балл дается при повторе  ещё через 3 дня.\n\nИтого, слово может стать выученным на пятый день, если вы набрали 5 баллов.\n\nКАК ЭТО РАБОТАЕТ.\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам на русском языке слово и предложение с этим словом. Вам необходимо ответить, как данное слово в текущем контексте должно быть переведено на английский язык.\n\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ и покажет карточку слова.\nВ любом случае вам будет показан английский вариант предложения.\n\nРазные формы слов учатся и учитываются в статистике независимо. Например, по словам I и me, see и saw подсчёт ведётся отдельно.\n\nКарточку слова можно посмотреть выбрав соответствующий пункт меню.\nПроцесс изучения слов начинается с того, что программа набирает из своего словаря 15 слов и начинает их показывать в случайном порядке.\n\nПосле того, как слово переходит в группу \"повторяемые\" из словаря извлекается следующее слово.\n\nПовтор производится через 1, 2 дня. Время, когда будет показан повтор всегда исчисляется от времени предыдущего ответа.\n\nЕсли вы отвечаете правильно на все повторы, то слово переходит в группу \"выученные\" и больше не будет предлагаться.\nЕсли вы посмотрели карточку, то баллы не начисляются.\n\nСЛОВАРЬ\nНа текущий момент словарь программы содержит около 1500 наиболее употребляемых английских слов, а также слов используемых в программе \"Полиглот\".\nНеправильные глаголы представлены в первой и второй формах. Подсчет баллов по каждой форме идет независимо. Слова в словаре расположены в порядке изучения.\n\nОЗВУЧКА\nДоступно произношение английского предложения."

      "label": "Welcome aboard your rocket ship to the next level of Japanese.\n\nHuman Japanese Intermediate is packed with content and features that will take your Japanese language skills to the next level. If you liked the first HJ, you'll love Intermediate. (And if you're new to Human Japanese, welcome aboard! Find a full list of content by chapter at www.humanjapanese.com/intermediate.)\n\nIn Human Japanese Intermediate, you'll find:\n\n- More than 40 illuminating chapters\n- Over 2600 example sentences and dialogs with crystal-clear recordings of male and female speech\n- Kanji animations, tips, illustrations, and more\n- Photos and cultural notes to keep you engaged and energized\n- Intelligent quizzes that track your history and help you focus on trouble spots\n- INGREDIENTS™ example sentence breakdowns for total clarity in every example\n\nLike its predecessor, Human Japanese Intermediate is built on the idea that the best way to learn and truly comprehend Japanese is to have it explained by someone who speaks your language. Core concepts are explained in a friendly, down-to-earth tone, with frequent comparisons to similar aspects of English. With humor and warmth, it demystifies and illuminates the real nuts-and-bolts of the language--not just vocabulary and canned phrases like many other products.\n\nExplanations come alive with deeply interwoven interactive example sentences--more than 2600 in total--so that you can immediately see and hear exactly what you're learning.\n\nStay on track with an exciting new patent-pending feature called INGREDIENTS™ example sentence breakdowns. Next to every sentence is an icon that provides an instantaneous, simultaneous lookup of every word in the sentence, even conjugated forms! That means you'll never lose your flow in the middle of an interesting discussion just because you've momentarily forgotten the meaning of a word.\n\nKANJI\nHuman Japanese Intermediate also gets into kanji in a big way. At the end of most chapters, a new batch of kanji is introduced, with animations of each character, plus example sentences, illustrations, writing tips, and more. Our goal is not to simply throw a bag of characters in your lap, but to carefully explain how everything works.\n\nTo this end, Human Japanese Intermediate keeps track of which kanji you've learned at what point in the text and automatically adjusts the \"spelling\" of words in example sentences as appropriate to your current knowledge. So early on, you might encounter the following sentence:\n\nそのひとの　なまえを　しらない。\n\nBut later, after you've met several of kanji used in these words, the version you would see is:\n\nその人の　名前を　知らない。\n\nThis approach removes the most overwhelming aspect of learning kanji--the fact that most sentences contain many characters you don't yet know--and that helps you to stay focused and energized.\n\nQUIZZES\nStay sharp with five different kinds of quizzes: chapter reviews, vocab, conjugation, kanji stroke order, and kanji flashcard.\n\nQuizzes keep track of which questions you get right and wrong, to help you concentrate on your trouble spots.\n\nAnd when you get a question wrong, it's not simply \"Try again.\" Wherever possible, the quiz provides a hint that is specific to that question, to help you remember and learn.\n\nPHOTOS AND CULTURAL NOTES\nWe've packed Human Japanese with hundreds of photos, illustrations, and cultural asides to keep you interested and energized. You'll find tours of hotels, train stations, convenience stores, supermarkets, kissaten (coffee shops), temples, and more.\n\nLEARN JAPANESE WITH US\nWe care deeply about helping you to grow in your understanding of Japanese. Whether you've worked through the original Human Japanese app or have come from a different background, it will be our pleasure and privilege to be your guide on the next stage of your journey. Hajimemashou!"

      "label": "With most dictionaries you need to know the root word before you can find the word you're looking for. \nBut one of the most frustrating things when you are a beginner is that you don’t know enough grammar to work out what the root word is! So you can’t look up the word.\n\nJapanese Dictionary with Grammar takes care of all that for you. It understands Japanese grammar rules so you only need to enter the word as is and the dictionary works out the root word for you and then looks it up. fast.\n\nFor example:\nSearch for たべられる (taberareru) in most dictionaries and you won't find anything. Search for it using Beginners Japanese Dictionary with Grammar and it will tell you that this is the \"Able to Do\" form of たべる (taberu), \"(v1,vt) to eat\".\nGo further and search for たべられない (taberarenai) and find it is the \"Regular Negative of the Able to Do\" form of たべる (taberu). \nOr even further and search for たべられなかった (taberarenakatta) and find this is the \"Past tense of the Regular Negative of the Able to Do form\" of たべる (taberu).\n\nThe grammar smarts also understands adjectives, so it knows that おいしくなかった (oishikunakatta) is the past tense of the negative of おいしい (oishii), (adj) delicious.\n\nOf course you can search for romaji, hiragana, katakana, English, kanji...\nIt's also smart enough to look for katakana if you put in hiragana by mistake (or the other way around). So even though you searched for べっど (beddo) it finds ベッド (beddo), (n) bed.\n\nAnd if you come across a kanji you don't know, just draw it with your finger and Japanese Dictionary with Grammar will look it up for you.\n\nOr if you remember one or two kanji from a word, but not the whole thing, then just put \"?\" for the ones you don't know and it will find all the possible words that match.\n\nThe dictionary includes over 200,000 words from the famous Monash University EDICT dictionary, and it works out the grammar on the fly, and no internet access required for searching.\n\nFinally, using a Japanese dictionary just got a whole lot easier."

Unfortunately, most simulation systems are large, immobile, expensive, and complicated to use. This app is for health care providers interested in using medical simulation for teaching. \n\nThis app creates a remotely controlled bedside patient monitor to facilitate medical simulations. To be effective, the app requires 2 devices (e.g. phone + tablet). It functions in 2 modes: monitor (display) and administrator (control the display). In monitor mode, the app displays customizable vital signs (including heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, end-tidal CO2, temperature) with options for cardiac rhythms (sinus, SVT, V fib) and associated waveforms/tracings. In administrator mode, a control panel offers the ability to immediately activate/inactivate and adjust each of the data fields. \nHealth educators can use the app with a simple resuscitation dummy (or even a child’s baby doll) and a user-provided case to lead an effective medical simulation anywhere from bedside to roadside."

Through the experience gained in these environments, students internalize these strategies and execute them mentally."

It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside.

      "label": "Welcome to Toca Life: Pets, where you and your animal friends run the show! What’s your favorite pet like? Furry and fast? Wet and wiggly? A little bit creepy? With more than 120 animals, Toca Life: Pets has every kind of pet you can imagine.\n\nEXPLORE FIVE LOCATIONS\n\nPET PARK: Enjoy the great outdoors with the pets! Take a dip in the river, have a picnic on the grass, play a game or discover a hidden cave. Or build an agility course to train your pets and test their skills. Poke around a bit, explore the tree — you might find some surprises to expand your pet family!\n\nPET HOTEL: Sometimes families go on trips without their pets, but thanks to the pet hotel, pets get a vacation of their own! With lots of cozy spaces, an aquarium and outdoor space, every pet will find a nice spot to play or relax — dog or cat, bird or sloth-bat!\n\nVETERINARY: The vet can help sick pets feel better and help healthy pets stay that way! You’ll find pills, drops and the instruments needed to operate on sick or injured pets. Pets can play outdoors or wait on the cozy beds until the vet is ready to see them.\n\nPET SHOP: Find everything you need for to groom, feed, play with and care for your pets at the pet shop. After shopping, grab a bite to eat at the pet shop cafe, where pets get a table too!\n\nBREEDER’S BUNGALOW: Here’s where the pet breeder starts and ends their day. The bungalow is, of course, filled with pets — hiding in the greenhouse and playing in the yard and splashing in mud. Don’t worry, the giant bathtub gets everyone clean again!\n\nENJOY A FREE GIFT\nBundled with Toca Life: Pets is a free pack of 18 exclusive iMessage stickers! Add pet stickers to your messages to express yourself in a fun way.\n\nFEATURES\nRole-play in five locations: pet park, pet hotel, veterinary, pet shop and breeder’s bungalow.\n- Meet 23 new characters.\n- Play with and care for 124 real and fantasy animals. \n- Bathe muddy pets and get them clean again!\n- Pretend to be a vet and care for sick and injured pets.\n- Dress your pets in fun hats — stack hats on hats on hats!\n- Pets can pee and poop!\n- Keep spaces clean by cleaning up all the pet poop!\n- Poop is also stackable! Stack the poop high, bag it up and discard!\n- Build an agility course to train pets and help them get the exercise they need.\n- Pull the branch in the pet park to discover a surprise!\n\nLIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION!\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice and your characters’ movements as you’re telling the story. Create videos up to two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share your storytelling later! \n\nAbout Us:\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

With the Kwebl Dictionary app you can quick and easily find signs, so you and your baby can start communicating from the start. From as early as 8 months old!\n\n\nFEATURES\n- A growing number of ASL baby signs right in your pocket.\n- Looping videos, so you can easily see how it’s done.\n- Slow down the video, to better view the hand shapes.\n- Find a sign in 3 simple steps with the easy interface.\n- Make a list of favorites, for the signs your learning.\n\n**More ASL signs coming soon.**\n\n\nABOUT THE APP\nWith the Kwebl ASL Baby Sign dictionary app, you can easily learn ASL signs to make early communication possible. This creates a tighter parent-child bond and stimulates early (language) development. \n\n\nABOUT US\nWe are Kwebl (from the Dutch word ‘Kwebbelen’, which means babbling), and we’re here to enable early communication between you and your baby. How? By making use of something we all do from birth. Making hand gestures!\nEven the youngest children want to tell you what they need, feel, and see. But they’re unable to express themselves verbally. This often brings along misunderstanding or even tantrums! \nBy signing ASL, your baby will be able to tell you what’s up. Spontaneously bursting into tears without you knowing why will be a thing of the past. By designing our products specifically for parents and children from 8 months up, we make real communication possible, easy, and fun. We use the official sings of the American Sign Language (ASL).\n\nIf we can help you with anything regarding ASL, or you have any questions, please let us know. Send us a message or see www.kwebl.co\n\n\nCONTACT\nWebsite: www.kwebl.co\nMail: asl@kwebl.co\n\n\n\nWe are super excited to hear what you think of our little app!\nSend your thoughts and tips to: asl@kwebl.co\n\nLike and follow us to stay up to date on future updates:\nwww.facebook.com/kwebl\nwww.twitter.com/kwebl"

Set against a haunting, atmospheric soundscape, the app shows planets and satellites in their correct positions, and offers mini movies, facts and other related tidbits.” - TNW\n\n“This jaw-dropping app provides a wholly interactive 3D model of our solar system, one that’s had me hooked for days. It’s the kind of thing you can imagine a science teacher using in the classroom of the future — except that we don’t have to wait.” - CNet\n \n“Zoom from Mercury to Pluto (which makes the cut in this app), passing each planet’s moons along the way. Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation. Turn into an astronomer and explore planets, moons, satellites, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, stars and other celestial bodies. Enjoy gorgeous graphics and visuals while navigating through the solar system!\n\n► Make virtual flights from one space object to another.\n\n► Travel in time and see what the universe and our Solar system looked like at a certain period.\n\n► Find an exciting view of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n► Watch a collection of educational solar system movies to learn about space-related topics including Earth's moon phases, Earth's cycles, tidal phenomena, and zodiacal constellations.*\n\n► Enjoy 3D planetarium with the help of special glasses and activating the anaglyph mode.\n\n► Share interesting screenshots of the app with your friends.\n\n► Choose the view mode comfortable for you (orrery/true-to-scale).\n\n*Available through In-App Purchases.\n\nSolar Walk is a great educational tool appropriate for both adults and children. The amount of information users can learn about the planets, moons, satellites and other celestial bodies is impressive. Information is age appropriate, detailed and animated video clips make learning our solar system even more engaging!\n\nThe entire Solar system can be explored with Solar Walk app!"

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text. This app never transmits data from your device.\n\n\nNote: Non-English localizations focus on solar system objects and constellation names."

Your child will help Everest and Chase use their special skills and work together as a team to rescue Mayor Goodway and Chickaletta while discovering more humorous moments, earning additional badge awards, and playing new mini-game activities that continue to promote problem solving through pattern recognition and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math).\n\nPAW Patrol Rescue Run collects personal user data as well as non-personal user data (including aggregated data).

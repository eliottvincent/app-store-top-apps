      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

Try this app!\n\n1. SOLVE REAL RUBIK'S CUBE\n    Place the Rubik's Cube in front of the camera, follow the prompts to scan the 6 Rubik's facets in turn, and then this app will show you the steps to solve the Rubik's Cube in 3D step by step!\n    Note: Automatic recognition of the Rubik's Cube needs to be done in a well-lit place, dim lighting environment will lead to recognition failure.\n    Tips: If the cube is not recognized when you scan it, you can rotate a random face of the cube and try scanning again.\n\n\n2. PLAY VIRTUAL RUBIK'S CUBE\n    Playing Rubik's Cube on iPhone feels playing a real one!\n    KEY FEATURES:\n    - Realistic 3D graphics makes you feel playing with real Rubik's Cube.\n    - Swipe the cube with your finger to rotate the layer of cube. Swipe through the blank area to rotate the cube.\n    - You can also tap the Undo button to undo the last action.\n    - Double-tap on the face of the cube to mark the face; double-tap again to remove it. After the face marked, subsequent rotations will generate guide lines to show the rotation action.\n    - Tilt the phone horizontally or vertically to change the viewing angle of the Rubik's Cube.\n    - Rubik's Cubes of 2, 3, 4 and 5- order included.\n   \nSuggestions or questions?

      "label": "Highly acclaimed in its four print editions, Bryan A. Garner's Garner's Modern English Usage is now available on your iPhone and iPad. This extraordinary reference tool contains over 8,000 entries and essays that reflect usage lexicography at its finest. Designed with the mobile user in mind, Garner's Modern English Usage is searchable, eminently navigable, and fully citable.\n\nGMEU is the liveliest and most compulsively readable reference work for writers of our time. It delights while providing instruction on skillful, persuasive, and vivid prose. Garner liberates English from two extremes: both from the hidebound \"purists\" who mistakenly believe that split infinitives and sentence-ending prepositions are malfeasances and from the linguistic relativists who believe that whatever people say or write must necessarily be accepted. \n\nThe judgments here are backed up not just by a lifetime of study but also by an empirical grounding in the largest linguistic corpora ever available. Garner has made extensive use of big data to include ratios of standard terms as compared against variants in modern print sources. No other resource provides as comprehensive, reliable, and empirical a guide to current English usage. \n\nIf you're concerned with writing and editing, GMEU will prove invaluable to you. Garner illustrates with actual examples, cited with chapter and verse, all the linguistic blunders that modern writers and speakers are prone to, whether in word choice, syntax, phrasing, punctuation, or pronunciation. No matter how knowledgeable you may already be, you're sure to learn from every single entry of this resource.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Easy-to-use search tools bring up words effortlessly\n* Voice search finds what you're looking for without having to type\n* Text is citable\n* Favorites feature to create a custom list of words \n* Usage quizzes test your knowledge with questions written by Bryan Garner"

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

Most people are scared of it, but I want to sneak inside.\n\nThere are so many rumors, I don’t know what to believe\n\nSome kids say the top floor glows at night and that crazy aliens live up there. Some say that strange experiments are going on in the living room. One kid I know absolutely swears they heard weird music coming from the basement. Can a house sing? I’ve also talked to kids who say the entire kitchen is covered in slime. Even my best friend, who never believes anything, told me the house is alive!\n\nI had to see for myself\n\nI did, I swear. I peeked inside last week. First, I made sure no one was around. Then I got on my tiptoes and spied in the kitchen window. I saw just the edge of the fridge. I think I saw some kind of gooshy red stuff oozing out of it, but I’m not really sure. Then I heard creepy rumbling sounds coming from the basement. It totally freaked me out and yup, I admit it, I sprinted all the way home. \n\nBut I’m just so curious, I can’t help myself. I think I’ll be going back. I want to go inside. I could really use a partner, though. Seriously, will you come with me?\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nPrivacy is an issue that we take very seriously.

      "label": "L’APP Bibbia di Gerusalemme nasce per offrire a tutti una nuova esperienza di lettura della Sacra Bibbia. Unica e inconfondibile, tradotta in tutte le lingue del mondo cristiano, la Bibbia di Gerusalemme è universalmente la più diffusa. Per il rigore degli studi è la più amata dai credenti, la più consultata dagli esperti, la più frequentata dal pubblico laico.\nLe varie parti che costituiscono La Bibbia di Gerusalemme concorrono insieme a farne un’opera unica nel suo genere.\nI rimandi ai versetti di altri libri della Bibbia (passi paralleli) sono di supporto all’approfondimento e alla dilatazione del testo letto: vengono usati come suggeritori di un senso che potrebbe sfuggire.\nLe note chiave costruiscono un percorso tematico all’interno di tutta la Bibbia, favoriscono una visione sintetica e d’insieme tra tutti i libri che formano l’Antico e il Nuovo Testamento, evitano che il lettore si perda nel particolare del singolo libro e lo accompagnano a capire che la Bibbia è un libro composto da tanti libri.\nNell’edizione italiana, tali note sono state ulteriormente ampliate per fornire elementi che aiutino la comprensione delle scelte operate dalla nuova traduzione della CEI (2008), che costituisce il testo biblico. Merito della nuova edizione della Bibbia di Gerusalemme è la grande attenzione con cui accoglie i mutamenti intervenuti negli studi biblici lungo i 50 anni che separano dalla nascita dell’opera. I commenti consentono infatti di individuare i filoni su cui esistono tra gli studiosi sensibilità e posizioni rinnovate. Le note critiche evidenziano e cercano di risolvere i problemi storici, filologici, di trasmissione testuale, per poi affrontare i nodi culturali e teologici con grande interesse alle odierne ricerche sul linguaggio.\nL’applicazione sfrutta queste caratteristiche proprie della Bibbia di Gerusalemme, offrendo la possibilità di annotare alcuni passi inserendo un commento personale, creare percorsi tematici visitando i vari passi paralleli, consultare durante la lettura le note dei versetti o semplicemente salvarne uno nell’apposita sezione dei segnalibri.\nLe xilografie, riprodotte da una Bibbia del 1606 stampata “apud Iuntas” a Venezia (e precisamente dalla terza edizione di questa, del 1625), impreziosiscono l’app e costituiscono un vero commento visivo, che si svolge in parallelo a quello letterario e teologico.\nLa veste grafica è stata realizzata con particolare attenzione alle tematiche di usabilità e accessibilità dei contenuti. La struttura di navigazione è stata progettata per fornire all’utente un’informazione completa, ponendo le sezioni principali accessibili da qualsiasi\ninterfaccia.\nLa navigazione superiore permette di effettuare una ricerca nel capitolo che si sta leggendo o in tutta la Bibbia. A fianco alla ricerca, troviamo le impostazioni del lettore. Da qui sarà possibile modificare graficamente l’interfaccia, così da rendere la lettura più leggera secondo le proprie esigenze.\nSelezionando un versetto qualsiasi del capitolo, verranno presentate all’utente diverse interazioni quali la possibilità di salvare il versetto nei segnalibri, aggiungere una nota personale o semplicemente effettuare una condivisione. I versetti annotati e i segnalibri saranno accessibili dalla navigazione inferiore. Da qui inoltre è possibile passare al capitolo successivo o al precedente in qualsiasi momento. E’ inoltre accessibile la sezione della cronologia che rende visibile il percorso di lettura dell’ultima settimana.\nDalla sezione degli appunti, l’utente potrà creare inoltre dei veri e propri taccuini. Al loro interno potrà andare ad inserire delle note personali indipendenti dalla lettura e i segnalibri dei vari versetti, così da categorizzare alcuni passi particolari secondo i propri criteri\npersonali."

      "label": "We received the \"Editor´s Choice\" award by Apple for \"Little Fox Animal Doctor\" And in addition our app was awarded the \"Tech with Kids' Best Pick Award\" for exceptional design of a children's app. \n\nLittle Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4. Little Fox Animal Doctor is the first 3D-App by Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger. She is also the creative genius behind Nighty Night, Little Fox Music Box and Nighty Night Circus. Her Apps have been downloaded over 5 million times worldwide.                                                                                                                                  \n\nThe App will make your children’s dreams of being an Animal Doctor come true!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

Along the way, stars and hearts can be collected, and later used to unlock 24 unique alien Thinkrolls.\n\nThroughout, players are encouraged to experiment. They will learn through trial and error to combine elements, and build on successive lessons to strengthen creative thinking, logic, problem solving, spatial cognition, and memory.\n\nDon’t be surprised when even younger players start thinking several moves ahead, in this fun, inventive, family-friendly combination of physics problems, logic puzzles, and exciting platform gaming!\n\nGAME FEATURES\n\n• 110 easy levels for ages 5+\n• 108 hard levels for ages 8+\n• Explore 7 bizarre, unique themed planets\n• 24 quirky alien Thinkrolls to collect    \n• Gather hearts and stars and use them to unlock new aliens\n• Unlimited retries, and no time limits—play at your own pace\n• Enhances logic, problem solving, memory, strategic thinking, and perseverance\n• Store up to six separate player profiles\n• Intuitive, easy to understand touchscreen controls\n• Original concept, artwork, and sound design\n• COPPA and GDPR compliant; no third party ads; no in-app purchases\n• No internet connection required\n\n------------------------------------------\n*** Featured as \"App of the Day\" and \"Best New App\" on the Today tab and Home page of the App Store!\n*** 5 stars by Common Sense Media - \"The adorable Thinkrolls and their sometimes maddening puzzle worlds will captivate kids of all ages, including some adults.\"\n*** Editor's Choice by Children's Technology Review (score 98%)\n------------------------------------------\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nWe respect our users’ privacy!

      "label": "**2019 Apps We Love** - Apple\n\nHatch rewards you for reading, studying, and completing homework. Unlock rare creatures with your focus energy and collect them all in your zoo. Be on the lookout for elite, legendary, and limited edition creatures. Focus sessions of 25 minutes or longer guarantees at least a rare species.\n\n-Creature Key-\nCommon: Green\nUncommon: Blue\nRare: Purple\nLegendary: Gold \nElite: Electric Black or Red\nLimited Edition: Varies \n\nHow it Works iPhone: \n1. Set your Hatch timer from 5 to 120 minutes \n2. Stay focused without leaving the app \n3. Enter the goal or other information for this session \n4. Hatch your new friend \n\n-How it Works iPad-\n1. Set your Hatch timer from 5 to 120 minutes \n2. You may let the timer run in the background \n3. Complete your task \n4. Hatch your new friend \n\nParents & Teachers: \nHatch utilizes positive behavioral reinforcement as a way to reward students for staying focused and completing tasks. We recommend starting off with shorter sessions, 5-10 minutes, and gradually increasing the focus sessions as your child or student becomes accustomed to staying focused for longer periods of time without interruption.\n\nPro Tip: Create a family or class focus group. Give your group a fun name and compete to see who can log the most focus minutes in the family. Set your Hatch timer for 25-30 minutes at night and let everyone in the family curl up with their favorite book and come together when it’s time to see what everyone has hatched. \n\nEndorsed by Order out of Chaos (@orderoutofchaos) as a tool to help students with ADHD or those who are otherwise easily distracted"

      "label": "Hit the Button Math is an app designed to help develop mental math and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout grades K-5. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered: \n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12 \n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers\n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game."

You can add images, lists, and use text formatting to structure your content.\n\n- Write cards on your iPhone/iPad\n\n- Add images\n\n- Group cards into topics\n\n- Text formatting & lists\n\n- Find and study only difficult cards\n\n- iCloud Drive support (syncs with the Mac app, which is a separate purchase)\n\n\nStudy Options:\n\n- Memorizing cards by covering the answer\n\n- Multiple Choice tests with randomly picked or predefined answers\n\n- Supports studying with the Spaced Repetition System (Leitner Box System)\n\n\nFor Teachers and Educators:\n\n- Compatible with the Remote Control feature of the Mac app. You can use the iOS app as a remote to control the study mode on the Mac while you are projecting on a big screen.\n\n\n\nPeople use the Flashcard Hero Mac & iOS apps to study many different subjects. Here’s a short list of the most popular subjects based on the over 2 million cards that users have shared among each other so far:\n\n- Medicine (anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, genetics)\n- Psychology\n- Law & business administration (economics, marketing, international law)\n- History and politics\n- Languages (Latin, Chinese, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German)\n- Social sciences\n- Music and music theory\n- Space physiology (how cool is that?)\n- Many more…\n\nYou see a lot of subjects in the top ranks where people have to memorize a lot of “structured” information. That’s because Flashcard Hero is designed specifically to go beyond language learning, offering more room on each card for facts, lists, and images. You can also organize cards into topics (to match chapters of a text book, for example).\n\nNote: This app is a single, one-time purchase. No subscriptions, no in-app purchases, no ads. The App Store might list the app as having in-app purchases, but those are only for backwards compatibility with an earlier version of the app. With this download, you get all features right away."

L’insegnante può utilizzare il software in aula, anche sulla Lavagna Interattiva Multimediale (LIM), creando dei percorsi personalizzati da condividere con la classe oppure selezionando direttamente l’esercizio scelto da sottoporre agli alunni.\nLa modalità \"Famiglia\" è, invece, pensata per un utilizzo del programma in un contesto domestico e offre la possibilità di creare percorsi personalizzati oppure di scegliere percorsi già organizzati per argomento.\nAll'interno dell'area \"Statistiche\", presente in entrambe le modalità di accesso, è possibile monitorare l’andamento di ciascun alunno e dell'intera classe nelle singole sessioni di lavoro per pianificare eventuali interventi mirati."

      "label": "Simply the best interactive, most complete, self contained dictionary and translator between English and Ancient Egyptian! \n\nThis app explains what the ancient symbols mean, how they were pronounced and how they formed words and phrases. \n\nThe App contains 2229 hieroglyphic signs and almost 49,000 words, phrases, titles, epithets, and locations used in Ancient Egypt. The dictionary also contains the Horus, Birth, and Throne names of all the known Pharaohs and Queens of Egypt. Our dictionary has more than twice the content of any other smartphone translation apps.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro has several modes: \n    Beginner, Student and Pro. \nBeginner mode uses a minimal set of 200 glyphs and an easy pronunciation guide. \nStudent mode allows choice of over 700 glyphs, organized by shape, and standard transliteration. \nThe Pro mode uses all 1,071 glyphs in Gardiner's classic categories with over 1200 additional New Kingdom and later signs.  \n\nA unique feature of Hieroglyphics Pro is the ability to find glyphs by how often they are used in inscriptions. Adding the common signs to a phrase or word is a snap! Egyptian words and phrases are drawn graphically in groups, in the artistic style of the ancient inscriptions.\n\nThe App now offers 4 ways to enter Hieroglyphs for translation:  \n    •Graphically from Gardiner groupings, or in Beginner Mode, Manley's Groupings\n      - A unique feature allows finding glyphs sorted by their frequency of use!\n    •Direct keyboard text entry of Gardiner codes (i.e., A1, D21, Aa2) and phonetic shortcuts as defined by the MdC (i.e., Htp, nTr,  r, etc.)\n    •By transliteration symbol from the MdC table\n    •Searching for keywords in a glyph's description or determinative words\n\n    Text entries of Gardiner Codes and MdC can now be edited with a cursor and finger swiping, just like other text editing apps!\n\nVery quick and convenient! \n\nHieroglyph Pro is the first and only mobile App to introduce Hieratic glyphs, and how they evolved over the centuries.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro is a modern iOS 16 App, back compatible to iOS 13, Dark Mode and all. It contains help files and links to both on-line references and to printed books for advanced study.\n\nHieroglyphics Pro has been developed and evolved in consultation with professional Egyptologists."

Set against a haunting, atmospheric soundscape, the app shows planets and satellites in their correct positions, and offers mini movies, facts and other related tidbits.” - TNW\n\n“This jaw-dropping app provides a wholly interactive 3D model of our solar system, one that’s had me hooked for days. It’s the kind of thing you can imagine a science teacher using in the classroom of the future — except that we don’t have to wait.” - CNet\n \n“Zoom from Mercury to Pluto (which makes the cut in this app), passing each planet’s moons along the way. Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation. Turn into an astronomer and explore planets, moons, satellites, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, stars and other celestial bodies. Enjoy gorgeous graphics and visuals while navigating through the solar system!\n\n► Make virtual flights from one space object to another.\n\n► Travel in time and see what the universe and our Solar system looked like at a certain period.\n\n► Find an exciting view of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n► Watch a collection of educational solar system movies to learn about space-related topics including Earth's moon phases, Earth's cycles, tidal phenomena, and zodiacal constellations.*\n\n► Enjoy 3D planetarium with the help of special glasses and activating the anaglyph mode.\n\n► Share interesting screenshots of the app with your friends.\n\n► Choose the view mode comfortable for you (orrery/true-to-scale).\n\n*Available through In-App Purchases.\n\nSolar Walk is a great educational tool appropriate for both adults and children. The amount of information users can learn about the planets, moons, satellites and other celestial bodies is impressive. Information is age appropriate, detailed and animated video clips make learning our solar system even more engaging!\n\nThe entire Solar system can be explored with Solar Walk app!"

      "label": "There's never been a better time to get into Astronomy! Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines.

This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch.

Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

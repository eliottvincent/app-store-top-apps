A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you won't be refunded for the remaining active period of the subscription.\n\nHere are links to our privacy policy and terms of use:\n- Privacy policy: https://account.mojang.com/terms#privacy\n- Terms of use: https://account.mojang.com/terms"

Play with friends or strangers in online play, challenge the AI, or play offline with friends face-to-face! \r\n\r\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t​he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens. \r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\r\n\r\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\r\n\r\n- Featuring original art by The Oatmeal\r\n\r\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\r\n \r\n- Digital versions of the hit expansions, including Streaking and Barking Kittens, as well as digital exclusive Betrayal and Party decks\r\n\r\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\r\n\r\nCreat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\r\n\r\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money.

Be careful though: leading has never been easy and it will be even more challenging in a similar world. Something mysterious has thrown the whole future humanity in a deep confusion, causing a continuous stream of events as wars, illness, famine.

But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages.

Through the game light puzzles, platforming sequences, and optional skill-based challenges will reveal themselves as more of Gris’s world becomes accessible.\n\nGRIS is an experience with almost no text, only simple control reminders illustrated through universal icons. The game can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their spoken language."

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

      "label": "\"Unruly Heroes” is a 2D action-adventure mobile game developed by the indie team at Magic Design Studios and published by Perfect World. The story is inspired by China’s first mythological novel \"Journey to the West” and strives to bring players an innovative experience through a fantastical art style and hilarious plot.\nSince the dawn of time, Buddhist scripture held the balance between Heaven, Earth, and the myriad creatures. However, as Evil’s wickedness began to grow, this delicate balance was thrown into chaos when the divine scripture was torn to pieces and scattered across the land. Those creatures that have encountered the mythical power of the fragments inherited unprecedented power. In doing so, this newfound strength kindled their heart’s innermost wickedness, turning them into horrifying monsters. With a world in chaos, a master and his three disciples accept Guan Yin’s decree and set out to reunite the fragments into a new scripture.\nThe game follows the journey of a master and his three disciples as they fight, solve puzzles, collect loot, parkour, platform and more on their mystical demon-slaying adventure. You must capitalize on their special attacks and holy relics in a battle of wit and bravery against demons to complete their pilgrimage in reuniting the scripture.\nFollowing its release on Steam and consoles, the mobile edition of “Unruly Heroes” is now available!\nHighlights:\nFantastic hand-drawn art style—Rich and in-depth level design illustrates a vivid sense of realism.\nSwitch between the master and disciples—Effortlessly switch between the four characters both in and out of combat to overcome puzzles and obstacles.\nRich and varied gameplay—Over ten different gameplay elements including: fighting, puzzle solving, loot collecting, parkour, platforming and more.\n\nAwards\n“Unruly Heroes” won the 47th Annie Award for best game character animation.\n\nFacebook: @UnrulyHeroesGame\nDeveloper Info: Magic Design Studios\nOfficial website: www.magicdesignstudios.com"

Her destiny is mysteriously linked to that of Peter, a young filmmaker covering a military expedition in the 1950s and Simon, a sailor of the Franklin expedition struggling to keep his crew alive.\n\nNavigate through time to discover what links them together.

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

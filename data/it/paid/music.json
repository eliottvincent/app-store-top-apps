Or create your own sound palette by recording the sounds around you into Note’s sampler instruments using your phone’s microphone. \n\nIf you want to take your ideas further, use Ableton Cloud to send your projects to Live (version 11.2.5 or later) without leaving the app. Open your project from Live’s browser, then keep working – you can edit all your MIDI notes, and all your samples and sounds from Note are exactly the same.\n\n\nBegin with a beat: \n• Choose from 56 Drum Sampler kits\n• Tap out a beat using the 16-pad grid\n• Quantize your beat to fix any loose timing\n• Nudge notes to correct mistakes\n• Add more layers of rhythm\n• Create beat repetitions with Note Repeat\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Experiment with effects \n\nStart with a melody:\n• Choose from 261 synth sounds and 36 Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Play your melody or chord progression with either the 25-pad grid or the piano roll\n• Set a key and scale to get instantly harmonic results, or leave your options open\n• Overdub more layers of harmony\n• Change parameters to shape your sound\n• Add effects to experiment with sound design\n\nSample your environment:\n• Create your own kits by recording percussive sounds into Note’s Drum Sampler \n• Record tonal sounds to create your own Melodic Sampler instruments\n• Manipulate your samples by cutting, filtering or repitching them\n• Shape or transform your sounds with effects\n\nCapture improvisations:\n• Play something, then tap the Capture button to keep it\n• Play at the tempo that feels comfortable and Note will detect it\n• Note will recognize the length of the phrase\n• A loop is created automatically\n• Quantize it, add to it, or change the sound\n\nCreate variations:\n• Note features a grid-based Session View layout\n• Double your loops to create variation within clips\n• Duplicate your clips and create different versions of your ideas\n• Create eight tracks with up to eight clips on eight scenes\n• Try different layer combinations and song structures \n• Export your work in Session View as an audio file to listen and share"

      "label": "Create surprising rhythms and harmonies by having colored shapes follow arrows on a two-dimensional grid.\n\nNew Path is a unique and playful tool that drastically changes the way you make music. Pick an instrument for each square or triangle (shapes) and let them walk around. Rotate the arrows to alter their paths. Now choose from an exotic list of arrow types to spice things up.\n\nShapes also have a mind of their own. By using crossroads and teleports they will have to decide for themselves which direction to take. This phenomenon will give you endless surprising results, but you’ll be able to keep full control by adjusting each crossroad/teleport bias.\n\n• Use the factory sets to play around and have lots of fun instantly! Or,\n• Create your own sets with the many features available!\n\n\nEach arrow contains adjustable values such as pitch, note duration, volume, etc, while shapes can interpret these values in their own way. For instance, a shape can add an octave to each pitch it comes across, so it will play all the notes one octave higher. \n\nUse delay and reverb to add flavor, use the advanced preset and generator systems to save and modify the grid, use the rules system to determine what should happen when two shapes meet, and much more.\n\nNew Path is also able to communicate with other hard- & software. With the MIDI out feature, New Path can control for example your hardware synthesizers. Use the Ableton Link feature to sync Link-enabled devices and play together with your friends.

It can be set to different time signatures like 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 7/4, 9/4, 11/4, 13/4. You can also select or deselect the downbeats and offbeats separately.\nYou can listen and play to all chords in all twelve keys, see which notes are the chord notes and scale notes and read information about the chord and the corresponding scale.\nIn addition to that, all chords can also be played randomly. You can choose to just randomly change the root or the root and the chord type.\nThe app lets you filter the chords, which allows you to only randomly play the chords of for example the modes of melodic minor or harmonic minor.\n45+ Chords:\n▵7, 7, -7, ø7, o7, 5\n69, ▵7#11, ▵7#5, ▵7#5(11), ▵7#9, ▵7#9b13\n7sus4, 7susb9, 7#11, 7#5, 7b913, 7b9b13, 7b13, 7alt\n-6, -▵7, -▵7b13, -7b13, -7b9, -7#11, -∆7#11, phryg, ø713, o7b2b11\nmajor, major/3, major/5, major/b9, major/9, major/b3, major/11, major/#11, major/b13, major/13, major/7, major/▵7\nminor, minor/b3, minor/5\naugmented, diminished\nSounds: electric piano, piano, organ and strings\n\n•Progressions•\n\nIn this section you can practice more than 50 chord progressions in all twelve keys.\nThe metronome, with all its setting options, is also included in this section.\nThe volume of the root note, third and septime or rather the tensions is adjustable.\nIf you press one of the two random buttons, the app picks a random root or a random progression and root.\n50+ progressions:\nII-7 V7 I▵7, II-7 V7alt I▵7, II-7 bII7#11 I▵7, II-7 V7b913 I▵7, II-7 V7b9b13 I▵7, II-7 V7susb9 I▵7\nIIø7 V7 I-, Coltrane Changes and so on…see full list on my website.\nSounds: electric piano, piano, organ and strings\n\n•Pad•\n\nUsing the pad you can put together your own intervals and chords.\nYou have four octaves and five sounds to choose from, with which you can select up to five tones. The tones can sound both simultaneously and one after the other.\nThe metronome, with all its setting options, is also included in this section.\nYou can choose out of these sounds:\nelectric piano, piano, organ, strings and sine\n\n•Fingerings for saxophone and reed adjustment for saxophone and clarinet•\n\nThere are fingering charts about standard fingerings, false fingerings, altissimo and quarter tones and information about reed adjustment of sides, table, tip, shoulder and heart.\nIf you don´t play the saxophone, you can hide this part of the app.\n\n•Features•\n\n* Stealth Mode (Ear Training Mode). You can use stealth mode in drones, chords and progressions. This will hide the currently played chords and display them afterwards.\n* A practice timer that informs you when your set practice time has expired.\n* Landscape mode.\n* Light- and dark appearance (Night Shift).\n* You can set if you play a C, Bb, oder Eb Instrument.\n* Are you an advanced player? The expert mode offers you additional information which could be confusing to unexperienced musicians.

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

The idea was to design a tool to manipulate a melody’s speed, direction, and pitch, as well as play multiple variations of the melody simultaneously.\n\nAs it turned out, the best implementation for this was to reimagine one of the most fundamental building blocks of all music sequencers: the piano roll.\n\nFUGUE MACHINE is the world’s first multi-playhead piano roll. Create a music sequence and play it back with up to four playheads at once — each at various speeds, directions, pitches, and more. Watch the playheads dance, and hear the complex patterns that emerge.\n\nIt’s mesmerizing.\n\nFugue Machine supports iPhone, iPad, MIDI, AUv3 MIDI, Ableton Link, Audiobus, Audiobus 3 MIDI, and Inter-App Audio."

Get creative and listen to how your compositions swing with the Genius Jamtracks trio.\n- Edit the charts for your favourite jazz standards however you like.\n\n\n“Genius Jamtracks is easily the best play along app out there! Particularly the piano voicings are more logical and realistic than other play-along apps. The bass and drums are not just a simple repetitive pattern, but actually use some jazz language. And it’s nice that you can make the band busy in unpredictable ways. As much like playing with a real group as you can get from an algorithm. Highly recommended!“\nPaul Bollenback  \n\n“It’s like a jazz musician wrote it. The drums and piano are just like how a jazz drummer and pianist would play. Couldn’t be an easy task to create that!”\nSteve Beskrone\n\n\n\n- Easy to read charts! \nCustom fonts make for beautiful, easy to read chord charts.\n\n- Rhythmic Complexity slider \nStart with simple comping and work your way up to mastering superhuman polyrhythms!\n\n- Harmonic Complexity slider\nStart with triads and work your way up to advanced substitutions and reharmonisation of the song.\n\n- The one and only polyrhythmic play-along!\nIn the Jam Session mode, the app decides on its own what to play and when to play it, based on the style of the song and the tempo. Experiment with how the app transforms the rhythm and the harmony according to the slider levels.\n\n- Master your polyrhythms!\nFocus on a specific grouping, polyrhythm or rhythmic displacement. Ask the trio – or an individual instrument – to include only what you’ve requested when they introduce polyrhythmic phrasing.\nAs you won’t know when or how it will be used though, this feature also helps sharpen your ability to improvise as well as mastering that rhythm!\n\n- Why it sounds great.\nIt’s all in the dynamics, note durations, space and feel. The Genius Jamtracks trio pays close attention to each of these elements to make the Genius Jam Session experience as close to the real thing as possible.\n\n- A real swing feel!\nForget the robotic triplets of other play-alongs. When changing the tempo, the app doesn’t simply play faster or slower, the swing feel changes as well. The app learned how to swing by internalising the jazz vocabulary and playing based on real transcriptions from the masters.\n\n- Actual voice leading!\nNo matter what your settings are, just press play and you’ll always have the same attention to voice leading from the pianist and the same effort in creating beautiful lines from the bassist to accompany you.\n\nReady to take your skills to the next level?"

This works great for cases like vocal practice. By using a higher latency, pitch detection will not respond to momentary unintended sounds and noise (works great for instrument tuning).\r\n• Smart Detection - Use machine learning to enable pitch detection only when certain instruments or vocal sounds are detected."

This makes it possible to produce synthesizer sounds like bouncing balls and clockwork toys.\n\nKronecker has four emitters that emit sound particles made from FM tones and noise. At the emitter you can specify at what timing the sound particles will be triggered. You can also add effects such as the pitch and tone of particles gradually changing.\n\nParticles emitted by the emitter can be processed with two resonators, and you can reproduce sounds like particles jumping on strings and pipes.\n\n# Note\n- This product is compatible with iPads and iPhones, but not compatible with Apple Silicon Macs.\n- This product mainly contains basic presets that are useful as a starting point for sound creation. Please note that there are no huge amount of presets. Enjoy making sounds.\n\n# Programmable Arpeggiator\nYou can easily create your own pattern.\n\n# Universal App\nIt is compatible with iPad and iPhone and has multiple screen layouts optimized for different screen sizes.\n\n# Audio Unit Extensions (AUv3)\nYou can use this AUv3 Plug-In in a host application that supports Audio Unit Extensions (AUv3).\n\n# Audiobus\nYou can stream live audio directly to an Audiobus compatible application. See https://audiob.us for more information.\n\n# Ableton Link\nLink is a technology that keeps devices in time over a local network. See https://www.ableton.com/link/ for more information.\n\n# MIDI input\n- Core MIDI, Virtual MIDI, Inter-App Audio MIDI Input\n- MIDI clock synchronization\n- MIDI controller mapping\n\n# Preset sharing\nYou can share your presets with other users.

It is also a great tool for musicians who want to keep themselves in good shape.\n\n- This version includes 30 lessons.\n\n- Each lesson has 25 rhythm ear training exercises = 750 exercises.\n\n- On each exercise there are some notes or silences missing in the music sheet. You have to listen and click on the button which fits what is missing in the music sheet.\n\n- After clicking you will see if your answer was right.\n\nRhythm is a fundamental aspect in music. A person with no sense of rhythm can't be a musician.\n\nBeing able to listen to music and knowing what´s going on in terms of RHYTHM is one of the most valuable aspects for a musician or a music student.\n\nThis app will help you to recognize faster and understand the different combinations of music notes values. You will become addicted to Rhythmic Ear Training with this app because it is presented in a fun and interactive fashion.\n\nIf you have a good understanding of rhythm you will play better the guitar, the piano, the drum set or any other musical instrument. And you will become more able to join a rock band if that´s what you want.\n\nRhythmic Ear Training makes it easier for you to read a sheet music and play an instrument. It is an essential factor to play in any kind of music ensemble.\n\nIf you are taking guitar lessons or piano lessons this app will be very useful for you. Playing piano music or guitar music is better done when you have a clear idea about music notes values, their multiple combinations and the resulting rhythms.\n\nRhythmic Ear Training is vital to understand music theory and the variety of music styles that exist. \n\nHow to play guitar, how to play piano, how to play drums or how to play any musical instrument is not just a matter of moving your fingers, it has a lot to do with listening and knowing what you are listening to. Rhythm is the main thing you need to listen.\n\nSo; this app is something you must have if you are a singer or if you are trying to learn how to read music, or studying music scales, or playing violin music or reading piano sheet music.\n\nWe hope you enjoy it!"

WaayFinder is here to help!\n-\nHow does it work? Let's say you enter the notes C, G, and A. The best match is C major—but it could also fit A minor, G major, and more. WaayFinder shows you all those possibilities, but highlights the best matches so you know where to start.\n-\nFeatures:\n* Finds matching keys. You give WaayFinder notes, it shows all the scales and modes that match, in order of best fit.\n* Scales and modes. Filter results by scale or mode. Supports major (Ionian), natural minor (Aeolian), harmonic minor, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, and Locrian.\n* Integrated audio. Listen to any note or scale with a tap. Great for getting a quick reference pitch!\n* Scale look-up. Quickly look up—and listen to—the notes for any key.\n* Tutorial. In-app tutorial gets you up and running in a flash.\n* Enharmonic mode. Display keys that match any enharmonic equivalents of the notes you entered (e.g., Bb will match A#)\n* Special note keyboard allows for speedy input. \n-\nWaayFinder is made in Toronto, Canada by Ten Kettles—the one-person (and two dog) company behind Waay, hearEQ, and Beat Mirror. I deeply believe in empowering *you* to make your best music, and that approach imprints itself into all my apps. There are no ads, no sneaky data collection, just honest music education. :)  \n-\nQuestions, comments, or feedback?

      "label": "Metronome Touch. Style of pendulum.\n\nMetronome Touch is created with one objective: to design a classic metronome with a unique style, so we combined a precise pendulum, perfected accuracy, and realistic interaction. Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can. This opens completely new ways when practicing, performing on stage or doing studio recordings.\n\nShould you be teaching students, they can follow your lesson more accurately while concentrating on their own devices synchronized with Metronome Touch. You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs. Choose between dark and light design as well as chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\n• Retina display\n Metronome Touch comes with a complete set of vector graphics for all display sizes and looks simply perfect on your device.\n\nFor more informations, app videos, faq's and pictures go to » www.cu4uc.com"

Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

      "label": "Modal Buddy for guitar is a fun and unique practice tool that teaches you modal theory in one day. \n\nIt's also a jam tool that provides looping backing tracks, scale charts, and let's you explore the anatomy of modal scales. \n\nNow you (and your students) can conquer modes quickly and spend more time soloing!\n\n---------\n\n“I’m a music teacher with 25+ years exp… Every musician should have a working knowledge of modes and this app is concise, linear, and very well done.” - Rich in Jax, Customer, USA\n\n“Modes are somewhat confusing at first and without the right guidance can be tricky. This app makes it easy. As a teacher myself I will be showing students this cool little practice app.” - DannyK6, Customer, USA\n\n“A revolutionary interactive modal practice tool.” - Paul Riario, Guitar World Magazine\n\n---------\n\nModal Buddy arms guitarists and instructors with an intuitive, step-by-step method for teaching and practicing modal theory, improving proficiency and bolstering the value of lessons. It empowers you with a fun and efficient vehicle for exploring the truly magical yet notoriously complicated world of musical modes. \n\n---------\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Checklist-style theory section for lightweight, structured learning\n- Audio examples (with solos)\n- Backing tracks to practice all seven modes\n- Zoomable scale charts\n- Practice examples\n- Revolutionary jam tool\n- Beautiful, intuitive design\n\n---------\n\nQ: WHO IS THIS APP FOR?\n\n1) Music instructors with a BASIC understanding of modal theory who want to increase their confidence and effectiveness in teaching this fairly complex topic.\n\n2) Music instructors with a COMPLETE understanding of modal theory who are looking for an easier, more consolidated approach to teaching and practicing the material with students.\n\n3) Intermediate to advanced music students who are proficient in pentatonic and major scales and are interested in achieving more expressive guitar improvisation / melody creation. \n\nQ: MODAL THEORY LITERATURE IS AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE - WHY BUY THIS APP?\n\nThe breadth of freely available information about modal theory is the main reason it’s so difficult to learn (and teach) - there is simply too much out there, and much of it is poorly written or incorrect; a recipe for confusion! Teaching modal theory effectively requires a distillation and simplification of core concepts, organized strategically so they're easy for students to learn - and a method for applying those skills during lessons. \n\nFor less than the cost of an average theory book, we've consolidated and organized modal theory into it's finest form, and hand-crafted a completely custom experience, ideal for mastering the material. We know you and your students will love our approach!\n \n---------\n\nFeel free to send any questions to support@ninebuzz.com."

      "label": "Description\n\nThis is the official and the only Mellotron app with sounds from the original library. This app contains 6 sounds but we also have the Mellotron XL app available, which contains 18 sounds plus emulations of the characteristics of different Mellotron and Chamberlin models. The XL version has some rare Chamberlin sounds, more Mellotron rhythms and fills from the MkII Mellotron plus a reverb unit.\n\nThis instrument supports Core Midi, Audiobus output (Audiobus 2 & 3) and midi input (Audiobus 3 only).\n\nThe Mellotron is a keyboard instrument that uses magnetic tape to play back recordings where each key has one tape. When you press a key, the tape starts and the corresponding pre-recorded note or sound is played back. When you release the key the tape is quickly rewound back to the start point.\n\nInvented in 1950 by the American, Harry Chamberlin, it became popular among recording musicians when it was\nmanufactured in the UK as the \"Mellotron\" (a hyphenation of \"melody-electronics\").\n\nBefore the introduction of digital samplers, this was the only way for keyboardists to play real instrument sounds\nlike strings, flutes, rhythm ensembles and sound effects from a keyboard instrument.\n\nFew people know about Mellotrons and Chamberlins, but almost everybody has heard the sounds they produce.\nAmong the most well-known tracks are BeatIes \"Strawberry Fields Forewer\" (flute), Moody Blues \"Nights in White Satin\" (3 violins), Oasis \"Wonderwall\" (cello), Radiohead \"Exit Music for a Film\" (choir), Lana del Rey \"Ride\" (Chamberlin flute).\n\nWe at Mellotron have collected, conserved and improved Mellotrons since 1989, and have been making tape Mellotrons since 1999 (the MkVI and MkVII). Please check out our website www.mellotron.com for a more complete history, real hardware instruments, our new digital M4000D Mellotron and M4000D Mini, tapes from the original masters, parts, service and lots of more info."

      "label": "The goal of Relative Pitch ear training is to learn to follow the flow of music, *effortlessly* by ear. The Ear Training University (ETU) app was carefully designed to take all the guess work out of how to learn this skill. Whether you’re a complete beginner in ear training or have done ear training before, ETU’s approach is sure to find any weaknesses your ears may have and systematically build your sense of Relative Pitch from the ground up.\n\nRather than presenting a “Grab Bag” of drills, we have designed a series of lessons that teach you how to do ear training the right way. These lessons include both video instruction and interactive drills.  Most of the settings --including tempo changes-- are already programmed into the drills to keep things interesting and challenging. All you need to do is follow along! \n\nProgress is easy to visualize simply by viewing the Lesson Cards which keep track of your stats, for example: when you started a lesson, the percentage completed, when you last visited a lesson and when you completed it. You can enter your music teacher’s email address and they will receive progress reports every time you complete an activity as well!\n\nThe videos explain how to properly do the drills which include listening drills, singing drills and spelling drills. They will encourage you along the way! \n\nThe best way to learn Relative Pitch is to do both singing drills and listening drills. Singing is active learning. Listening is passive. Learn first by singing and then test your knowledge by listening. ETU’s interactive drills make learning Relative Pitch with this method easy and doable for everyone! \n\n(We realize that watching videos is not for everyone. However, if you only watch one video, watch “The Discernment Drill – The Key to Discerning Harmonic Relationships!” This video discusses one type of interactive drill called \"The Discernment Drill.\" This drill really opens up the ear so that it can perceive harmonic intervals and chords *instantly* even when played lightning-fast during Speed Rounds.)\n\nFeatures:\n⁃\tInterval training drills (up, down, harmonic), both Singing and Listening Drills.\n-      Professionally recorded voice-over cues for drills.\n-      Interval and Chord Spelling drills.\n⁃\tChord Identification drills (arpeggios and harmonic)\n⁃\tChord Inversion drills (harmonic and arpeggiated)\n⁃\tGive your responses with on-screen piano keyboard or large easy to push buttons.\n⁃\tChange instruments at any time during drills\n⁃\tInterval singing and chord singing drills\n⁃\tSetup your correct vocal range\n⁃\tSlow self-paced drills and “Speed Rounds” which test whether you’re ready to move on!\n⁃\tVideo instruction\n⁃\tTeacher Reports (these reports even include spelling test questions and the student’s responses)\n\nPlease check in with us frequently as we have a lot of new content planned for ETU. We’re excited to bring you this app and will be updating frequently!"

      "label": "Unfiltered Audio's Needlepoint is now available on iOS as a Standalone app or AUv3 plugin!\n\nUnfiltered Audio raises the bar (and lowers the tonearm) with Needlepoint: a revolution in vinyl simulation. Continuing the retro themes of their smashed-up hit lo-fi-af, Needlepoint presents a full platter of advanced physical modeling to dive deep into the warm, fuzzy sound of turntable noises and artifacts beloved by many. Of course, since this is an Unfiltered Audio plugin, you can push the needle far past realism and dive into some seriously warped sounds.\n\nWhile many vinyl plugins are content to use looping samples of noise, Needlepoint uses physical modeling to achieve its incredible sound. Needlepoint synthesizes all sorts and sizes of detritus and distress on a record: hair, dust mites, scratches, warping, etc. These are not randomly modeled, but rather accurately distributed onto a rotating, algorithmic platter. Changing the speed of the record can greatly change the nature of Needlepoint's impact on your sound. While you may be used to vinyl RPMs like 33 1/3, 45, and 78, have you ever wondered what it would sound like to tempo sync a turntable to your DAW? Now you can!\n\nBeyond noise, ambience, and tone, Needlepoint includes other effects to fully etch out your vibe. A single knob compressor (inspired by lo-fi-af's PRESS knob with six additional algorithms) can be added before or after the signal chain. This compressor can emulate algorithms from famous hardware samplers associated with vinyl, or even mimic the sound of analog distortion introduced by the vinyl pressing process. A BROKEN mode emulates a broken record a broken record a broken record a broken... Where were we? Oh right, a BROKEN mode acts as an unpredictable looper by jumping the grooves on your recent audio. You can automate the mode's toggle to create all sorts of cut-up and glitchy phrases.\n\nNo vinyl plugin would be complete without a SPINDOWN button that creates that classic vinyl stop (and start!) sound. Here you can control the rate of the spindown to better fit the effect into your mixes. Finally, at the end of the processing chain, Needlepoint features a granular pitch shifter to help you achieve that chopped up vibe without needing to manually change the speed of your tracks.\n\nDespite all of these features, Needlepoint is incredibly easy to use. With a beautiful interface and an extensive set of presets, Needlepoint will help you itch that nostalgic scratch that your tracks need.\n\nAs an AUv3 plugin, Needlepoint has been tested to work perfectly with Garageband, Drambo, AUM, Cubasis, Beatmaker, Nanostudio, apeMatrix, Loopy Pro, and more! Additionally, with its clear layout and smart resizing, Needlepoint can be used on tablets and phones with ease.\n\n(Note for Drambo users: Drambo does not yet have automatic Plugin Delay Compensation for managing plugins with latency. As a result, tracks with Needlepoint will not line up properly with other tracks. An upcoming patch for Drambo will add this feature in.)"

You have to integrate your part to the ensemble.\n\n- While practicing you can click on the bar from which you want to repeat.\n\nClick on the icon of the instrument you want to practice, at the bottom of the main page, to find out how to study each lesson.\n\nThe best way to approach these materials is to have a band with your friends and together practice each of the 30 lessons that this app presents. Once you have worked through the 30 lessons, you can download the app for each instrument that contains 40 additional lessons (70 in total). Just click the blue arrow icon on the main page to download the app for your favorite instrument.\n\nIf you don't have someone to play with in a band, each lesson has a “d” section where you listen to the other instruments while you play your own part. This gives you the experience of playing within an ensemble, whether you play Guitar, Piano/Keyboards, Bass, or Drums.\n\nThis app is useful not only for those who want to play in a band, but also for those who want to know what makes a musical style sound like it. What does a bass player have to do for something to sound like Blues or like Latin Music. What are the main rhythmic characteristics of Funk or Rock. What should a drummer do when asked to play a Blues rhythm or a Cha cha chá. How the guitar and piano/keyboard should interact, and so on. These are fundamental aspects for any musician, be it a performer, an arranger or a songwriter. The exercises in this app will help to have a clear idea of the aforementioned aspects.\n\nThe most common elements in each style are used and they are presented in ascending order in terms of their degree of difficulty."

      "label": "The ELECTRIBE reborn in an even smaller form A full-fledged rhythm machine for iPhone\n\n● Featured in \"Best Music Apps\"\n● Featured in \"Best New Apps\"\n\nThis app’s intuitive operation allows anyone to easily create powerful beats on the ELECTRIBE series. The enormously popular ELECTRIBE-R instantly became a must-have item for track-makers around the world, and now it’s been reborn as an app for iPhone.\n\nWith this app, we’ve effectively “put the original hardware chassis into your iPhone,” by faithfully reproducing the sound engine and design of the ELECTRIBE-R. We’ve also included the latest preset patterns and many new functions that are currently featured on the “iELECTRIBE for iPad”, released in 2010. , taking a further evolutionary step in technology. Taking advantage of the ease of use that you expect on iPhone, we have maximized the intuitive nature of the ELECTRIBE to make this new product worthy of its name: the iELECTRIBE mkII.\n\nIt won’t take long for you to enjoy the ultimate experience of the Electribe series. This apps intuitive nature and familiar interface make it easy to create beats with an analog feel that’s like nothing else.\n\n● Amazing rhythm machine that generates powerful grooves\nWe’ve perfectly replicated the thick-sounding synth engine of the ELECTRIBE-R and its intuitive step sequencer. Now you can instantly obtain extreme tonal changes and powerful rhythms with just one touch\nNot only can iELECTRIBE for iPhone be easily enjoyed by anyone, but it also allows detailed beat-making that transcends iPhone specs. In addition to playing back the provided audio data, you can also freely synthesize sounds from a single waveform and combine those sounds into your own original beats. This allows for the true experience of music production that connects all musicians.\n\n● Three hundred built-in rhythm patterns that only this app can produce\nWith 64 of the latest preset patterns, 192 from the first-generation ELECTRIBE-R, and 32 template patterns for various genres, this app successfully draws out the full potential of the thick sounding analog beats. There are approximately 300 inimitable rhythm patterns that you’ll hear only from iELECTRIBE for iPhone. Electro, house, techno, drum'n'bass, dubstep, hip hop, techno pop, and IDM are some of the wide range of electronic music genres that are provided.\n\n● An ELECTRIBE that you can put in your pocket and take anywhere\nWhether you’re on the train or bus while commuting to school or to work, at a coffee shop, or in your bedroom, you can enjoy beat-making anywhere and anytime you like. Your completed beats can be transferred to your DAW software via the audio export function. You can also use the WIST function to play wirelessly with a friend using two devices simultaneously.\n\n● Powerful functions that bring infinite possibilities to your grooves\nWe’ve packed maximum potential into this machine with eight types of powerful master effects featured on the upper-level models of the ELECTRIBE. This includes the ring modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R and the cross-modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R mkII. This app allows you to switch back and forth to choose between the two. It also includes the BEAT FLUTTER function that uses a proprietary randomizer to create fresh rhythms and the motion sequence function that remembers your knob movements. In addition, you can use an external USB-MIDI device such as the nanoPAD or nanoKONTROL for performance and control. There’s also support for the latest iOS technologies such as Inter-App Audio, Audiobus, Virtual MIDI, and iCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

These are Drum Beats from different music styles which have been arranged from the simplest to the most complex.\n\nROCK (40 Beats)\nBLUES (15 Beats)\nLATIN MUSIC (15 Beats)\n\nThis is an educational app that makes easy for anyone to learn how to play some of the main Drum Beats in the Drum Set. From beginner to intermediate.\n\nYou don’t need to know how to read music to use this app.\n\n- On each exercise there is a “SLOW” button with which you can listen to the music at a slow speed and see animations of the Drum Set parts so you can play by imitation on your own Drum Set. This section allows you to learn the Beat.\n\n- You will also see animations of the beats (rhythm) and the notes on the staff. This helps you to understand, intuitively, the way in which music is written and read. In this way, you learn to play each Drum Beat by imitation and at the same time you understand the basis of musical writing and reading.\n\n- There is also a “NORMAL” button with which you listen to the music at its real speed. There are no more animations. The Beat is repeated over and over again so you can practice until you reach the normal speed. You can use this section to improvise along the Beat that is repeated over and over again.\n\nIn the Latin Music section we include the following beats:\n\n- Bossa Nova\n- Chachachá\n- Mambo\n- Samba\n- Salsa\n- Merengue\n- Songo\n- Bolero\n- Son Montuno\n- Rumba\n\nMore Drum Beats coming soon!"

      "label": "the BLEASS reverb is a unique sounding plugin effect bringing your music production and live performances towards new soundscapes!\n\nThe BLEASS reverb is composed of 3 different stages:\n\n1/ A first stage modifies the input source by correcting the gain and setting up early reflections pre-delay in order to re-create distant walls. \nThis first stage also contains a filter to modify frequencies. Switch between two different filter types: \n- the Low-Shelf filter can reduce or boost your basses.\n- the High-Pass filter cuts the low part of the signal and creates a resonant peak on interesting frequencies.\n\n2/ The second stage offers a unique-sounding reverb with size modulation and length controls. It also contains a high frequency damping control in order to re-create plate reverb effects, as well as a freeze toggle button for infinite sound soaring and exploration.\nThis reverb offers also an X/Y panel which applies a set of fine-tuned frequency shifter as well as a wave shaper in order to mutate your reverb space on the go!\n\n3/ The third stage offers a duck effect made of a compressor side-chained on the dry input in order to bring clarity to heavy kicks and basses\n\nFinally, a dry-wet controller offers control over the reverb level. \n\nAll these features are shown within the factory presets, and you can save your own presets which will automatically carry over across different host apps. \nAll variables are exposed as AU parameters in hosts which support automation. \nBLEASS reverb can also be used as a standalone app using headphones and mic or an external sound card.\n\nCheck out www.bleass.com for video tutorials and demos!\n\n*** NOTE : this is an Audio Unit Effect Plugin (AUv3) which ideally requires a compatible host (such as AUM or Audiobus) or DAW (such as GarageBand or Cubasis) ***"

It does what you would expect from a metronome but it also comes with unique exercises that are designed to challenge and improve your sense of timing.\n\n* Selected features *\n\n- Tap to mute/change accents for beats\n- Tap to set tempo\n- Built in unique exercises (modifiers)\n- Arrange songs in setlists for practice and gigs\n- Select tempo from a list of Italian names (Larghissimo-Prestissimo)\n- Select tempo from a list of Classical metronome markings \n\n* Exercises *\n\nThere are seven built-in exercises in Pulse designed to help you develop your timing:\n\n* Mute beats\nThe metronome randomly mutes beats, giving you less to lean on, forcing you to develop and trust your own internal timing.\n\n* Mute bars\nThe metronome randomly mutes for a set maximum number of bars, forcing you to keep time yourself. The metronome is still running, but silently. When it unmutes again, you can check if you are in time or not.\n\n* Shift beats\nThis exercise mutes all but one of the beats in the bar. The sounding beat shifts. For example, using a time signature of 4/4:\n\n1 - - -\n- 2 - -\n- - 3 -\n- - - 4\n- - - -\n\n* Random Start Tempo\nPlaying a piece at slightly different tempos forces you to pay more attention to the timing. This exercise keeps you on your toes by altering the tempo each time the metronome starts.\n\n* Accelerator\nThis exercise lets you practice a difficult piece/passage at a comfortable tempo and then increase the tempo gradually.\nSet the tempo to a low setting where it is possible to play the piece correctly. The modifier will keep this tempo for a set number of bars and then increase the tempo with a set number of BPMs.\n\n* Decelerator\nThis exercise does the opposite of Accelerator. Set the starting tempo and the modifier will keep this tempo for a set number of bars and then gradually decrease the tempo with a set number of BPMs.\n\n* Rollercoaster\nThe tempo varies and the goal is to follow as it goes up and down, like a rollercoaster. This is an advanced exercise forcing you to listen and pay attention to the tempo. It's very fun as well."

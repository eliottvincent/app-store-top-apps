On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing.

For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version.

      "label": "\"This really is the synth that keeps on giving! Inspiration and intuition truly blend together in this musical instrument.\"  Alan Parsons\nSunrizer Synth is a virtual analog synthesizer that takes the definition of iOS synthesizer to the next level. \nThanks to carefully designed architecture and heavy usage of coprocessor it blurs the boundaries between iOS and hardware synthesizers. \nSunrizer was built to perform and works perfectly with any MIDI keyboard or sequencer. A lot of research has been done in order to achieve unheard warmth and clarity. \n\nHIGHLIGHTS \n· True SuperSaw sound emulation, first found in the legendary Roland JP-8000 synthesizer. SuperSaw is a layered waveform consisting of multiple saw waves which are detuned to create an extremely full and epic sound. \n· Two filters per voice with configurable routing. 15 filter types available, including less common like Comb, Formant or Frequency shifter. \n· The Morph Group function lets you continuously morph of up to 30 parameters in a sound (including effects), using only the modulation wheel. \n· Full support for CoreMidi, MIDI mapping, Virtual Midi Ports and background audio.\n· Multi mode lets you multiply oscillators to get unbelievably fat and full sound. \n· Support for microtuning - load scl and tun files. Create fascinating microtonal music which uses intervals not found in the Western system of 12 equal intervals to the octave.\n\nOSCILLATORS \n· 2 warm-sounding analog modelled oscillators, 2 sub-oscillators (except SuperSaw). Available waveforms: Saw, PWM pulse,Triangle, SuperSaw, FM (frequency of phase modulation). 6 oscillators per voice in multi-sono mode. \n· Oscillator 2 hard-sync and configurable routing \n· FM (true frequency modulation) and PM mode \n· Osc-mix, ring modulator \n· White noise oscillator \n\nFLEXIBLE MULTI FILTERS \n· Two independent filters per voice with configurable routing. Filter types: LPF, HPF, BPF, Analog LPF, Notch, Comb, All pass, Power LPF, Power BPF, Wave shaper, Resonator, Resampler, LPF+Resampler, Frequency shifter. \n· Configurable routing: serial or parallel with bypass option. \n· ADSR envelope, keyboard tracking and full LFO control. \n\nMODULATION \n· Two LFOs per voice. It's possible to assign each LFO to almost any parameter. 3 LFO running modes: trigger, 1 shot, global. 6 waveforms, phase and fade-in knobs.\n· The Morph Group function lets you continuously morph of up to 30 parameters in a sound (including effects), using only the modulation wheel. \n· Two Modulation ADSR Envelopes for amplitude and filters cutoff. \n· Pitch and modulation wheels. \n\nEFFECTS \n· A number of effects are built in: distortion, hi-q reverb, chorus, rotary speaker simulation, equalizer, phaser and stereo delay. Dual-band FX processing. \n\nARPEGGIATOR \n· Sunrizer incorporates very powerful programmable arpeggiator. You should think of it more like a small step sequencer. \n\nOTHER FEATURES \n· Over 380 presets, 7 additional banks available for FREE in web library (more coming soon)\n· Hold button allows you to to keep notes sustaining until you play new notes\n· With Chord Memory function you can play the chord by only pressing single keys\n· Phrase sequencer\n· Compatible with AudioBus \n· Adjustable polyphony: 6-20 voices \n· Playback modes: poly, solo, arp \n· Built-in recorder supporting AudioCopy, DropBox and iTunes file sharing. \n· Supports AUv3, MIDI, IAA, AudioBus 2.0\n\nVisit www.beepstreet.com for user manual and audio demos. \n* Sunrizer is now available on Mac and PC, check our website for more info\n\n\"Specs aside, the most important thing is the sound… and it’s great.\" musicradar.com \n\n\"Sunrizer is the first truly mature polyphonic synth for the iPad, a real, smooth and powerful sounding option for all sorts of stage and studio performances.\"\nMark Jenkins, author \"Analog Synthesizers\""

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

      "label": "Progressions is an AUv3 MIDI plugin for your favourite DAW. It can be used to generate a unique set of chords that are unrelated to traditional scales, which become predictable and repetative over time. Instead, Progressions uses a unique way of mathermaically generating a series of related chords using only a root note and mode (major or minor). Chord sequences are limited by the selected complexity and freedom levels, which mimic the way traditional composers of old would wander away from tonality and back again.\n\nThe complexity level start off at Basic, which uses only the most common chords (I, IV, V and relative minor ii, iii, and vi triads). As you progress through the levels, you can add parallel majors and minors, sus and dom chords etc. At level 3 we start to introduce 6th and 7th chords, and then 9ths chords, all the way to 11ths, 13ths, Quartals and all their variations.\n\nThe freedom level allows us to specify how far to drift away from tonality (the root), even allowing you to create never ending randomized soundscapes.\n\nProgressions allows you to quickly randomize a toolbox of chords, that can be played in a variety of modes (block chords, arpeggiated, or strummed). These can be synced to a host application, triggered remotely or pieced together into a song.\n\nSong mode allow you to change play modes on the fly as well as being able to control many features of the app in real time.\n\nProgressions supports open and closed chords with selectable voicings. It has an intelligent algorithm that attempts to align top notes of chords, add additional bass, and open chord padding to give equal weight to chords with only 3 notes. You can even play with rootless voicings.\n\nThe Humanize section allows you to control chord and note timings, as well as set velocity variations to ensure things don't get too robitic.\n\nProgressions also features an integrated arpeggiator and strummming pattern editor. You can load up to 6 arp and 6 strum patterns at the same time and seemlessly switch between them manually, remotely, or using song mode.\n\nIf you run multiple instances, Progressions allows you to sync your chord pads, song chain, arpeggiator / strum patterns between instances.\n\nProgressions can be loaded as a MIDI plugin or as an Instrument for those programs that don't support MIDI plugins (such as GB). Additionally when loaded as an instrument, you can use either internal sounds (soundfonts) or send MIDI directly to other MIDI instruments.\n\nFeatures\n\n• Block Chord, Arpeggiator and Strummer modes.\n• Supports open and closed Chords.\n• Varying complexity levels of chords.\n• Freedom levels control how far from the root key you can go.\n• Rootless voicing mode.\n• Open chord padding support.\n• Additional bass note mode.\n• Supports all common chord types.\n• Edit the preferred chord list to exclude certain chord types.\n• Input MIDI control for chords and play modes.\n• Automatic top note alignment of chords.\n• Hold Pedal support.\n• Built in ARP and STRUM editor.\n• Humanize options for chord and note velocity and timings.\n• Comprehensive Song Mode with 256 steps and looping.\n• Randomize chord progressions, arps and strumming patterns.\n• Route Chord/Arp/Strum modes & MIDI thru to any of 4 output ports.\n• Supports soundfonts when loaded as an Instrument plugin.\n• Sync multiple instances of Progressions.\n• AUv3 compatible MIDI plugin supporting Sync to Host."

Time Guru is the only metronome with the ability to mute its sound at random, in sequenced patterns, or both, so that you can assess whether you tend to rush or drag or loose your place with odd meters. Time Guru can periodically leave you on your own so that you strengthen your own internal sense of time, rather than relying on the constant, rigid, external time keeping of a metronome. It's like training wheels that sometimes come up off the ground.\n\nTime Guru also features:  \n-the ability to play in different time signatures or sequences of time signatures\n-create rhythmic drum-machine like patterns\n-save presets for tempo, meter, sound and muting-\n-35 loud sound sets; \n-Human or robot voice counting in English, Chinese, French, German or Russian - great for teaching!\n-tap tempo (5 to 300 BPM range)\n-super accurate, rock-solid timing via a customized audio engine. \n\nAnd of course it can function as a normal metronome. \n\nNoTreble.com says: \"I love the aesthetic and layout of Time Guru. It’s very simple and elegant. Time Guru also offers ability to set randomness of your subdivisions (great for testing your internal clock)….There is one thing that Time Guru does that I absolutely love, and for which, this app will always live on my iPhone – at the top of the screen, you will see a series of numbers (1-7). When you press a number, it is set first in a sequence and you can choose a subdivision that will then repeat that number of times (or set it to rest that number of times). Sound confusing? It isn’t, because the layout is so simple. Every time you press a new number, it is set next in the sequence and you choose your continue to choose your subdivisions.\""

Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

      "label": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis"

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

Frequency spectrum store & load, RT60 store,  and Chart store. Stored files can be sent as Email.\n\nIncludes ISO Octave Calibration feature - corrects for your device's microphone response. Also includes wideband calibration. The calibration discs are moved up or down so as to obtain a flat response, and match the overall SPL to that of an external meter.\n\nUse: home theater, audio engineer, car audio, etc\n\nOnline manual at: https://sites.google.com/site/bofinit/iaudiotool\n\nPlease join the AudioTool Discussion Group to request features or report problems:\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/audiotool-discussion-group\n\nAudioTools's Spectrum Analyzer component uses FFT on batches of samples recorded at the microphone. Hann windowing reduces aliasing. Recorded spectra may be stored as files in the device memory, and then loaded later and displayed together with the live spectrum. \n\nThe \"Store\" button will store the current live spectrum. The \"Load\" button brings up a list of stored spectra. One of these can be chosen, or the \"Cancel\" item selected to return to the main display, or the \"Clear\" item selected to remove the currently loaded spectrum.\n\nData collection can be paused and restarted.\n\nThe deciBel meter component uses IIR filters and exponential averaging to calculate Flat, A and C weighted response at speeds of Fast, Medium and Slow.\n\nA pair of cursors can be shown on the RTA and Chart Recorder displays: each can be moved to any position, and will display the SPL & time/frequency values measured there. Initially, both cursors are positioned mid-screen - simply drag them to a new position with the fingertip. The cursors can be turned on and off in the Menu.\n\nThe loudspeaker polarity checker can be used to check whether a loudspeaker is wired in phase: connect the AudioTool output to the speaker under test, select \"Polarity\" from the signal generator screen, then return to the RTA screen. If the speaker is out of phase (polarity reversed) AudioTool will show \"Pol ---\", otherwise \"Pol +++\" if the speaker is in phase.\n\nThe Noise Criteria (available from the Menu) function shows  a set of NC contours overlaid on the 1/1 Octave RTA display and the calculated real time current NC value is also shown.\n\nThe Chart Recorder shows a moving trace of the SPL measurements over the last few minutes.\n\nReverberation (RT60) measurements can be made by starting the RT60 component and using a loud clap (or similar) to trigger the measurement. RT60 times measure how much reverberation or echo there is in a room or auditorium.\n\nThe Signal Generator generates White and Pink Noise, Sine, Square, Triangle and Ramp waves, and Impulses. The generator uses multiple cycled buffers that are refreshed randomly so ensuring truly random White/Pink noise. The Pink Noise algorithm uses Kemmet's method to adjust White Noise into Pink.\n\nSine/Square/Ramp/Triangle Frequency can be set via the arrow buttons or directly entered using the keyboard.\n\nThe Impulse signal is a delta, issued approximately once per second. \n\nThe accuracy in frequency of the generated periodic signals is quite good: on the iPad, errors were of the order of 1% throughout most of the range. Sine wave fidelity is good throughout most of the audio range. Other signals' leading and trailing edges show ringing and decreasing frequency response artefacts in the upper ranges.\n\nDisclaimer: iAudioTool's performance depends on the iPad/iPhone hardware, and is not guaranteed to meet any audio measurement or safety standards."

      "label": "OSCILLOSCOPE & SPECTROGRAM is a powerful audio analyzer app and audio unit plugin\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- Run as both Audio Unit and standalone app\n- View up to three seconds of audio on the screen\n- Pause and scroll horizontally to browse back in time\n- Pinch to zoom in / zoom out\n- See both oscilloscope and spectrogram separately or overlayed together\n- Frequency trigger mode helps identify the precise frequency and MIDI note of sounds in the spectrogram\n- Stereo and mono views\n- Level based trigger mode has lookahead, pause, and zoom\n- XY mode shows stereo correlation\n- Automatically adjusts FFT size to fit zoom setting\n- Bark-frequency scale spectrogram shows nice detail at low and high frequencies\n- When zoomed in, the oscilloscope uses sinc upsampling to show you a close approximation of what actually outputs from your audio interface after digital to analog conversion, rather than just displaying raw audio samples.\n\n\nWHAT DOES THIS APP DO THAT OTHERS DO NOT?\n\n1. Pause Button\n\nWe can't emphasize enough how useful this is. You never have to worry about trying to catch short events that disappear quickly because you can watch the sounds go by slowly at a 3 second viewer scale, then just pause and scroll back if you missed something. When you get to the event you want to see you can pinch to zoom in right down to sub-sample level of detail, then zoom back out when you are done and zoom in on something else. This feature alone makes almost all other oscilloscope apps unnecessary because it means you can easily see ANYTHING that you need to see.\n\n2. Frequency Identification Mode\n\nIn frequency mode, when you touch the frequency scale on the right of the screen a blue line appears on the spectrogram. When you position the line above a specific frequency on the spectrogram, a panel on the left side of the screen displays the octave, note name, and MIDI number. You can then use the frequency timing oscilloscope to lock in on the exact pitch in cents so that you not only know which MIDI note that sound corresponds to but you know exactly how many cents sharp or flat. The ability to simultaneously see the frequency on the spectrogram and confirm it with precision on the oscilloscope allows you to quickly and easily identify musical pitches to a level of accuracy that have not seen anywhere else, not even in desktop software.\n\n3. Trigger with Lookahead\n\nAlmost every oscilloscope has a feature where it re-draws the screen each time the input signal level crosses a specified threshold. This is the main and most basic function of any oscilloscope. However, when setting the trigger at a high level to view the attack section of musical notes or drums, we miss the first part of the note. By using lookahead, this app allows you to see a few milliseconds BEFORE the trigger point so that you can see the whole sound you want to examine.\n\n4. Carefully Designed Spectrogram \n\nIn all spectrum analyzer displays, the upper end of the frequency scale is crowded, meaning that a single pixel corresponds to 10 or 20 frequencies in the frequency analysis. In many other analyzer apps one of two things occur: either 9 out of 10 frequencies in that upper range simply get ignored and disappear from the spectrogram display, or all 10 frequencies combine together to make the pixels in the upper range appear brighter than low frequency sounds of similar volume. This may seem like a technicality until you run a sine sweep or a 20 KHz tone through the analyzer and find that large sections of the input simply aren't displayed on the analyzer screen. Looking at these kinds of test signals on a spectrogram is the primary way that we test and evaluate the quality of audio effect plugins. If a spectrogram is to be of any real use as an analysis tool, it should do this right. Other spectrograms often mess up the lower frequencies too, either by making them take up too much space or by making them very pixelated. This spectrogram carefully avoids these problems."

      "label": "XAir Monitor Mixer is a personal monitor mixer for select Behringer and Midas digital mixers. It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

      "label": "This metronome app is created by a musician for musicians. Almost all metronome apps boast about their accuracy, but users with sensitive hearing notice inaccurate beats all the time. It used to be impossible to create a perfectly accurate metronome on a mobile device. Despite the failure of other apps, perfect time is possible for TrueMetronome: its unique engine creates perfect beats with ABSOLUTE ZERO error. For this reason, TrueMetronome is the most accurate metronome app on any mobile platform.\n\nSound quality is the second issue for software metronomes. Serious musicians prefer a natural sound filled with overtones, but all metronome apps play short synthetic samples (so that the first sound stops completely before the next begins). Thus, you hear an artificial, dead sound. Moreover, the identical samples playing at the same frequency can drive any man crazy! TrueMetronome solves this problem thoroughly: all sounds are recorded from real metronomes, a beat does not affect the gradual decay of its predecessors, and each beat's sound is a little different from the others. All this contributes to the natural sound which is easier on your ears.\n\nFinally, an aesthetic, thoughtful interface is an important aspect of any application, and TrueMetronome pays particular attention to it. Creating an electronic metronome interface is simple, but TrueMetronome does not cut corners: it recreates the look and feel of a real mechanical metronome; every mark on the scale is labeled with a tempo mark, the deviation angle of the pendulum depends on the tempo, and the tempo is selected by dragging the weight.\n\nYou can adjust the tempo in 2 BPM (beats per minute) increments by dragging the digital weight. This restriction prevents a change of tempo from accidental touches, and when you need greater precision in the selection of the tempo, there are \"+\" and \"-\" buttons as well. On the lower part of the metronome, you can turn the bell on and off and select the number of beats per measure.\n\nTo start or to stop the beats, simply tap anywhere.\n\n-------------------------------------\nKey features\n-------------------------------------\n- Perfect beats with ZERO error (unparalleled!)\n- Natural sound without duplicate samples (unique to TrueMetronome!)\n- Realistic look and feel with particular attention to comfortable usability\n- Optional bell on the first beat of the measure\n- Selection from all known meters: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n- Tap tempo function\n- Skins"

The app delivers high-quality audio backing tracks for personal practice, which, when used in conjunction with facsimiles or modern editions of historical sources, enable the user to develop skills in the areas of improvisation and ornamentation. Suitable for students, amateurs and professionals alike, the app features adjustable pitch and tempo settings and user-defined looping capabilities. Tracks are recorded using a sampled historical organ in a temperament appropriate to the repertoire and are designed to complement the pedagogy of historical treatises. \r\n\r\nThe idea behind Passaggi springs from a desire, common to many performers of historical repertoires, to recreate aspects of the musical experience as it may have existed at the time a piece of music was written. Improvisation and ornamentation may form only one aspect of this wide-reaching desire, yet it is clear that in this area students and professionals would achieve more successful immersive study and practice if the harmonic and musical context for improvisation, ornamentation and diminution were more easily accessible.\r\n\r\nHow many of us can open Dalla Casa’s Il vero modo… and sing the baseline to his exercise embellishing Striggio’s I dolci colli, for example? And how much more profitable would our practice of this exercise be if we could? How many more of us would practise improvising on a ground, if we had a ground? The Passaggi project will enable more effective exploration of historical sources and approaches by providing digitally some aspects of the innate and inherited musical awareness common to all musicians of the past that we strive to connect with in the twenty-first century."

This tool is meant to bring character, or \"dirt\" to your incoming audio signals. Save your own presets for instance recall of the sound you've created to find the \"sweet spot\" in your instruments and/or mixes.\n\nLo-Fly Dirt installs as an Audio Unit effect for hosts that support the format such as Audio Bus, Beatmaker 3, Garage Band, Cubasis, AUM, etc.\n\nDefault Mode: \nAdds subtle character of the input sound. Simple saturation and light, preset compression are added to the overall sound bringing out unique tones & textures of your source audio. The wet/dry knob at the 100 or full position would leave source audio \"warmed up.\" \n\n60 Mode: \nThis preset mode is based on some of our favorite characteristics of an iconic drum machine. Activating this button should invite you to 12 bit nostalgia immediately boasting tasteful saturation, small amounts of compression, and a more rounded high end. Great on drums.\n\n404 Mode [Green Light]: \nOne of our favorites, this mode is the only mode that should add subtle low-pass filtering to the input signal. This mode will apply low pass filtering at 12db per octave around 11.6Khz. The wet/dry knob will continue to filter the sound to no more than 200Hz. The signal will benefit from some additional signal boosting with minimal make-up gain and small amounts of bit rate reduction, or \"dirt.\"\n\n404 Mode [Orange Light]: \nThis mode brings the coveted vinyl simulation to Lo-Fly Dirt. Mix knob will tastefully add intensity to your track with it. Try using this mode on an aux/bus channel and send select sounds through it. Very cool stuff!\n\n1200 Mode:\nAlso built around our love for another iconic drum machine, this mode brings great punch, character, and dirt to any signal it treats. Especially useful for drums and percussion based audio.\nmore punchier variation of the 60 mode. Enjoy 12 bit goodness by default, but additionally a boost the signals character by our dirt and boost in the low-mid frequencies.\n\n8 Bit Mode:\nSimply put, this mode brings back the classic sound of a legendary game console. We've added a bit of punch to the incoming signal and you're able to blend it with great 8 bit artifacts that will allow for some brand new creations...and fun!\n\nSK- 5 Mode: \nAlso built off the things we love about the classic 8 bit sound, but with a twist...this mode adds HP filtering and punch! Instant dirt is applied when this mode is activated, high pass filtering and punch is applied as you move the signal from dry to wet. The HP filter is set to cutoff at 300Hz."

Whether you’re a pop star, rock star, classical opera or karaoke singer, you need to perform daily vocal warm ups.\n\nYou need to care for your voice. It's your key to success.\nVocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos gives you the power to take control of your voice anytime, anywhere. With this app you will improve your tone, breath control and stamina.\n\nLet's face it; we all need a little assistance when it comes to improving our tone, breath control and stamina. And with constant upgrades to the software and course material, you can keep up to date with the latest singing techniques, trends, all in this premium app.\n\n***** It's like having a vocal coach in your pocket! *****\n\nYou can warm up, exercise your voice and cool down your entire range anytime, anywhere, anyhow.\n\nGuitarists, bass players, pianists and all other types of musicians spend thousands of dollars on equipment. All these resources are put into improving their sound and feel, perfecting their art.\n\nAs singers, we have many options available, so why do we hesitate? What stops us spending money on our instrument?\n\n***** The answer is simple! *****\n\nThere are so many tools out there but none are made for YOUR voice. Most vocal programs are generalized for specific voice types and meant to be widely applicable. The problem here is that everybody’s voice is UNIQUE! We can’t just be slotted into a criterion and asked to perform. With such limitations, the extremes of your range cannot be explored and you cannot grow and improve as a singer.\n\nMore importantly, when substandard singing tools try to push you into the wrong vocal range you can end up damaging your voice! Unlike a guitarist, if we damage our instrument we can’t just go out and buy a new one.\n\n***** The benefits of a recording studio! *****\n\nWith Vocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos, you have all the benefits of a recording studio production at a fraction of the cost. When you voice improves and your range increases, you can simply update your warm ups with a few taps. No need for new recordings or additional costs!\n\nWhen we set out to make Vocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos we had a single mission: to produce a product that helps singers. And we mean really help. No gimmicks, no quick fix tools, just good old-fashioned exercises that can be customised for YOUR voice. These are the techniques and exercises that all singers use.\n\n***** Here are a few of the features this app makes available to you! *****\n\n- Complete control over your vocal range for each warm up.\n- Create an unlimited number of warm up playlists.\n- Select and reorder exercises to suit you needs.\n- Flawless playback controls with Tempo Memory. You only need to set the tempo of each exercise once and the app will remember your preference.\n- A step by step warm up creation wizard that will guide you through the steps you need to create your own playlists.\n- A huge variety of industry tested and proven vocal exercises, with even more to come in FREE updates.\n\nDon’t just take our word for it, see what the professionals have to say about Vocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos.\n\n***** Chris Kennedy - Voice Council *****\n\n\"Vocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos is well designed software that will, no doubt, appeal to many singers... when combined with a correct singing technique, the app is a useful and powerful tool for singers...\" \nhttp://voicecouncil.com/review-musicopoulos-vocal-warm-up-app\n\nWhen it comes to your unique voice, the secret of success is a Vocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos.\n\nWe have been able to produce an app that is astounding, and as singers ourselves we are proud and very happy to be able to share it with you."

      "label": "Songzap is The World’s First Pre-Production App for Songwriters, Musicians, Singers and MCs!\n\nSongzap simplifies drum programming, multitrack recording, song arrangement and mixing, and brings these capabilities literally to a musician’s fingertips. It helps take the guesswork out of song development and enables artists to capture and expand their musical ideas. Songzap focuses on the creative aspects of songcraft and pre-production, helping songwriters to design and interact with beats, experiment with song structures, refine performance approaches, develop and reflect on recordings, and mix a high-quality demo that can be shared with others. You don’t need any technical knowledge to use Songzap – just a passion for making music! \n\nDespite being so simple and intuitive, Songzap is also designed for helping experienced musicians, songwriters and MCs to become more prolific in creating and signing-off songs, harnessing creative inspiration and capturing ideas on the go. So if music is your thing, Songzap is for you!\n\nONE-TIME PURCHASE!\n\nSongzap is a one-time purchase app, there is no recurring subscription charge for using this app. You buy it, you own it. Our goal is to help people make more and better music and we aim to keep our app prices as low as possible to ensure all musicians can benefit!\n\nSongzap is developed by musicians for musicians. You can learn more about the app developers and their creative work, and see examples of the app being put through its paces, over at the Songzap website.\n\nSONGZAP FEATURES\n\n• Capture your vocals and instruments with Songzap’s multi-channel Tracking feature.\n• Use Songzap’s AI-powered Groove Designer for instant, expressive drum programming\n• Structure and finalise your songs with Songzap’s intuitive Arrange tool\n• Get creative and make your songs shine with Songzap’s powerful Mixer engine\n• Export your mixes, MIDI data and individual audio files to share with the world!\n\nFURTHER FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Powerful Drum Notation: allowing you to learn, generate and edit grooves.\n• Original Drum Kits sample library\n• Beat Pattern Presets: start with classic patterns to power your performance and jamming\n• Bounce and Import tracks: for unlimited tracking, jamming, collaboration and layering!\n\nSONGWRITING AND PRE-PRODUCTION\n\nFor many songwriters, singers, MCs, instrumentalists, and musicians there is a discernible gap between ideas (inception) and the route to final production. The professional studio can seem an intimidating place, and the technology used to capture and create recordings impenetrable. We have developed Songzap with the intention of narrowing this gap.\n\nUsing our app you can approach song-making directly, from a variety of tried and tested starting points: by recording your voice and instruments using your phone’s onboard microphone; by putting a groove down first to guide your performance and develop ideas; by experimenting with different song structures and looping sections of a song; and by balancing your recordings and rhythmic elements with intuitive mixer functions. Then, you can export your song to share with the world, or export a folder with all your project assets (full-resolution mix, individual tracks, arrangement markers, lyrics, notes, and drum MIDI data) to bring into the studio for further development. You can also import recordings and bounce down tracks, for unlimited layering!\n\nGET SUPPORT AT THE SONGZAP WEBSITE\n\nThe Songzap website (www.songzap.app) is a one-stop-shop for everything you need to be inspired about music making and getting the best results from Songzap, including:\n\n• Tutorials and extensive videos on all aspects of using Songzap\n• Advice on the art of songwriting and pre-production\n• Demo movie of how Songzap’s developers use the app in creating their own music \n• Blogs and guest articles on songcraft and musical creativity\n\nGet your songs into shape with Songzap!"

Rumours among the workers spread quickly that there was a strange feeling being around these boxes, as if time flows in a different way, not just forward but sometimes also folding back on itself. The miners nicknamed them, the five boxes of reverberation. After the excavation process, to study them more closely, it was decided to transport them back to earth. \n\nRymdigare is part reverb, part noise and drone machine, part quality degrader and part wave shaper. The reverb is built from 5 reverberation boxes where you can control the sound with length and ratio parameters, tail and weight skew parameters and an internal feedback parameter, that could be used to create swelling tails. There is also a built in octave shifter, resonant filter, speed and level degrader and 4 LFO sources for modulating a selected set of parameters, including the LFO speeds themselves. The app can run stand-alone, connecting to other apps through Inter App Audio or AudioBus or it can run as an AUv3 plugin.

It will also play nicely with your car radio, connected via USB, Bluetooth or CarPlay.\n\nIn addition to audio formats natively supported by iOS (e.g. mp3, AAC), Soundwaves can also play FLAC, Opus and Ogg Vorbis content.\n\nSoundwaves can also play movies from your Subsonic server, as long as they are in a supported format (.mov, .mp4, .mpv, .3gp) or a proper transcoding has been configured on the server.\n\nSoundwaves works with other media servers which implement the same Subsonic API's, such as Madsonic, Airsonic, Supysonic, LMS or Ampache.\n\nNote about privacy: tracking only happens when using the free, ad-supported version.

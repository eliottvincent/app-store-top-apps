      "label": "DigiStix 2 is an AUv3 compatible drum machine and sampler plugin for your favourite DAW.\n\nThis new version of DigiStix brings some distinct advantages over its predecessor, most notably the ability to host up to 64 samples per drumkit with 5 layers per pad. The interface has been drastically redesigned for iPad to make better use of full screen mode, allowing a popular MPC style 4x4 pad layout with 4 banks of samples. Digistix 2 also allows greater control over the multi-sample layers, with the ability to individually control the volume levels and pitch of layers as well as global pitch and tune settings all from the new sample window.\n\nPreviously, each pad had effect sends for the internal reverb and delay effects, but this can now be routed to external busses 9 and 10 for processing using external effects. \n\nThe controller editing is now build into the main display and can be edited in place without the need to scroll the interface. It also now supports extra effect controllers. A new context aware control window allows you to quickly change pad settings without the need for popup windows. \n\nDigiStix 2 now supports GM and original DS drum kit layouts, and includes a sophisticated multi-layer Auto Sampler, capable of recording new GM compatible drumkits automatically from your hardware. It is 100% backward compatible with the original app, and can be used as a drop-in replacement.\n\nDrag and drop support now allows you to directly drop samples on specific layers, as well as preview and edit them directly. You can create new kits by simply combining banks from existing kits into one mega kit, or use our non destructive referencing to include sounds from other kits.\n\nThe randomize feature has been enhanced so you can randomize individual instruments or within specific banks. The new continuous MIDI learn mode makes custom mapping a breeze.\n\nPatterns can also be exported as MIDI stems for use in other packages including a direct import to Helium clips. You can also export patterns as audio in the latest version.\n\nThe auto sample feature allows automated recording of GM compatible kits directly from hardware drum machines. The slice editor can also be used for MPC style slicing of audio clips.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• 64 Assignable Pads (4 banks of 16 pads).\n• Advanced Randomize Pattern feature.\n• Internal & external effect routing.\n• Mix and match different kits with drum references.\n• Up to 64 beats per pattern.\n• Songs up to 255 patterns in length.\n• Reverse Mode, Triplets and Accents.\n• Supports Mute Groups.\n• Multi-layer and Round Robin modes.\n• DS and GM MIDI Mapping.\n• 64 channel Mixer.\n• 8 band EQ.\n• Randomize Feature.\n• Sophisticated Auto Sampler\n• Export loops to audio and MIDI formats.\n• Looping Mode with Time Stretching.\n• Build in Delay, Reverb, Overdrive, Bit Crunch and LP/HP Filters.\n• Paramter Automation from your DAW.\n• Local and Remove MIDI Sync.\n• Built in Sampler.\n• Multi-bus/outputs when using AUM\n• Multiple Import options.\n• Melodic Remapping.\n• MIDI Mapping.\n• Real time and Step pattern recording. \n• iTunes and Filer importing of samples.\n• Files App Drag & Drop Support\n• Sample Slicer"

      "label": "Simple banjo tuner to tune up your banjo. This is for a standard 5-string Banjo, in gDGBd tuning.\n\nTuning your banjo can be a difficult task for you if you are just beginning banjo. The good news is, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. A nicely tuned banjo can make your music sound a lot better and help you greatly while you're are just getting the hang of finger placement for notes.\n\nTouch the note for the string you want to tune and then turn the tuning pegs on your banjo and match it up with the note that is being played.\n\nNote: For those of you who are beginners and don't understand the tuning of a banjo. The banjo tuning is unique because the last string is actually higher in pitch then the rest of the strings. So for those of you who are wondering whats up with this tuner - it's normal.\n\nTip: Make several passes tuning each of the strings. For example you might have noticed that if you have tuned all the strings once, and then back to the first one you tuned, it might be off a little bit. This is because you are increasing or decreasing the tension on each of the strings as you tune it and the instrument's body might bend ever so slightly due to this difference in tension. This causes the other strings to slightly change in pitch. So make sure you keep on checking and tuning the strings until all are in tune, so make several passes.\n\nFor more information on how to tune Banjo visit:\nhttp://www.tuneinstrument.com/howto/tune/banjo.html\n\nAny questions using the App? Write support@tuneinstrument.com and we we'll get back to you promptly.\n\nIf you need to tune other instruments just simply have a look into our other applications: Cello Tuner Simple, Banjo Tuner Simple, Mandolin Tuner Simple, Double Bass Tuner Simple, 12-String Guitar Tuner Simple, Viola Tuner Simple, Guitar Tuner Simple, Ukulele Tuner Simple, Bass Tuner Simple, Dulcimer Tuner Simple, Dulcimer Tuner Simple Mixolydian, Dulcimer Tuner Ionian, Balalaika Tuner Simple.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @tuneinstrument\nLike us on Facebook: facebook.com/tuneinstrument\nFollow us on Google+: tuneinstrument\nSubscribe to YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/tuneInstrument\nSign up for newsletter and or visit us: www.tuneinstrument.com"

On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB.\n\nCross-Network. Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.\n\nScripting and local messages.\n\nA lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... \n\nWelcome to the next generation!"

Now with Drum Kit Designer feature and detailed online tutorials.\n\nFeatured in Modern Drummer 'New and Notable' - July 2018  \n\n\"an invaluable aid not only for drummers but also studio engineers and producers\" - Sound on Sound Magazine\n\n\"I can’t recommend this app highly enough ... for the money, it is indispensable. It's simple, accurate, looks good, and the tuning information is worth the cost of the app alone.\" - www.mikedolbear.com\n\n“***** I never knew I could have this much fun tuning drums!” – Adamrod (App Store review)\n\n“***** Just tuned my first drum and this app is awesome!” – bburt85 (App Store review)\n\n“***** Buy this app if you are a drummer!!!” Lildrummerboy (App Store review)\n\nThe original and most innovative electronic drum tuning app - iDrumTune Pro brings unrivalled accuracy and features that have never been possible before for assisting with drum tuning. Built by world experts in drums and musical acoustics, and backed up by a detailed online training course on Drum Sound and Drum Tuning.\n\niDrumTune Pro includes the following features:\n\n* Pitch Tuning – to make your drums sing and allow you to play musical phrases around the kit\n\n* Lug Tuning – to ensure that the drumhead is evenly tuned and gives a smooth and warm tone\n\n* Resonant Head Tuning – to allow you to be sure that the two heads are working together and giving rich overtones\n\n* Spectrum Analyzer – so you can really start to understand what frequencies are excited and heard when playing the drums\n\n* Drum Kit Presets – so you can save and load your favourite tunings and share them with the world. Now also includes the interactive Drum Kit Designer feature.\n\n* The Science of Drum Tuning – and extensive manual on the science and art of drum tuning and getting the best out of iDrumTune Pro \n\niDrumTune is the first and by far the most intelligent and accurate system for analyzing drum sounds and assisting tuning – developed by drummers, music producers and acoustics research Professors. iDrumTune provides you with a measurement of the drumhead vibration frequency, much in the same way to an acoustic guitar tuner which measures the vibration frequency of a guitar string. In Pitch Tuning mode, you simply hold the iPhone over the center of a drum, about 2-4 inches away, and strike the drum in the center.\n\nThe iDrumTune readout shows the recorded sound waveform and gives the strongest frequency recorded. There is also a tuning indicator bar which shows the drumhead tuning relative to musical notes, so iDrumTune can be used to ensure that your drums are in key with each other or the song you are playing. A frequency spectrum view also allows more detailed analysis and helps with tuning the drum at the lug positions.\n\niDrumTune provides advanced tuning features including an intelligent filter function, Lug Tuning mode and Resonant Head Tuning mode. The filter allows unwanted frequencies to be ignored by the analysis algorithm, whilst Lug Tuning mode offers the simplest and most innovative method for tuning an even frequency response at the lug positions on the drumhead.\n\nThe Preset Manager allows you to save all your favourite drum tunings and call them up when you are in the middle of the process. Drum kits can also be exported and imported, so you can share your favorite tuning setups and load new ones in from other drummers.\n\nDrum Tuning isn’t easy, and drums don’t respond exactly the same way every time you hit them. For that reason, it's valuable to know a little about the science of drum tuning. iDrumTune includes a comprehensive text on the science of drums and drum tuning in order to help you get the best of iDrumTune and to become an expert drum tuner!\n\nWatch the iDrumTune tutorial videos and read reviews on iDrumTune at www.idrumtune.com"

The playful touch UI invites anything from live performance, experimentation to learning and mastering the granular concept.\n\nMultiple plugins: Import, Record or Live Process\nYou can import your own WAVs (standalone & AUv3 Instrument plugin), Record audio (Record effect plugin) or live-process sound (Process effect plugin) to create anything from drones and granular echoes to moving microtonal audio textures.\n\nDesigned for touch: Kinetic Sliders\nAll sliders and XY pads are linked to a physics model which lets you flick and throw them around. Minimise the friction for endless bouncing motion, as an innovative substitute for traditional LFOs and modulation. There was never a better reason for using a touchscreen for music.\n\nShimmer Feedback effect\nLike a shimmer reverb, except it feeds the processed audio back into the grain engine. This lets you create an endless loop of pitch-shifting spaciousness, turning even the simplest of sounds into massive woolly mammoths. \n\n- 3 Voice grain engine, each with an independent playhead\n- Filter inspired by the Oberheim Xpander, including its resonant Phase filter\n- Kinetic sliders and pads for playful interaction with the sound\n- Universal design (iPhone and iPad; iPad Air 2 or higher recommended)\n- Custom scales, unquantised mode and even Scala-import for microtonal experiments\n- Use WAVs (or other audio files), record audio or load the app as a live-processing audio effect\n- Real world tested as an instrument in numerous live performances by Hainbach\n- Offers light mode and dark mode UI"

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

      "label": "Co-designed with Berlin-based electronic musician Hainbach, Gauss brings the oldschool tape-looping art form to mobile devices. This creative field looper works both standalone and as an Audio Unit effect plugin and puts the possibilities of using looped tapes in your hands. Without the need for scissors.\n\nLike real tape loops Gauss takes you off the grid of your DAW: you can adjust tape speed and direction, even during recording. The flow of your loops will drift organically as the tape follows its own cyclical timeline. \n\nUse overdub, or even multiple instances of the Audio Unit plugin, to create multi-layered ever changing sonic palettes. \n\nWe want this app to be a celebration of digital audio technology, so when audio quality is degraded it will do so in a pleasingly crunchy digital way. For example, recording on low tape speeds will give you longer recording time, but at the cost (or pleasure) of a distinctively lower recording quality. So Gauss mimics the behaviour - not the sound - of magnetic tape.\n\nSet the length of the tape, record and overdub your audio, play around with tape speeds; Gauss captures the essence of two ends of tape stuck together in all its unsynchronised, free-running glory. There's even a unique built-in 4-step polyrhythmic sequencer for sequencing tape-speed changes.\n\n- designed as a standalone field recorder and an Audio Unit effect plugin (AUv3) in one package\n- universal app: plugin and standalone work on all iDevices, iOS11 and higher\n- variable tape speed; seamlessly change direction and speed during playback or recording\n- 4-step sequencer lets you trigger (polyrhythmic) tape-speed changes in sync with your host tempo\n- variable inertia for the tape drive motors (from instant to very slow speed changes) \n- built-in multi-mode filter with LFO modulation\n- delay effect with optional host-sync mode\n- “1989” mode uses a special 8 bit/11KHz tape head for a last-century vintage digital sound\n- 45 seconds maximum loop size at 1x speed, proportionally longer at lower speeds (.e.g 90 seconds at half speed, etc.)\n- overdub at any speed or tape direction\n- plugin supports global cross-host preset handling (requires iOS13+, compatible AUv3 host)\n\nFind the user manual at ruismaker.com"

      "label": "Hey, musician!\n\nHaving a strong internal clock is important anytime you’re in charge of the beat. Metronomes, with their perfect time, can help build that strength. But you and your bandmates don’t have perfect time. We’re human. We fluctuate.\n\nHumanome teaches you to hear an irregular tempo and adjust your playing to it, as you must always do to stay in the pocket with other non-metronomic human beings. \n\nHumanome sensitizes you to playing more responsively and accurately – more in the groove – with any external time source, whether it’s precise or not: a metronome, a click, a drummer, a band, a sequence, a track. \n\nHow it works:\n\nHumanome encourages listening. It trains you to react, moment by moment, to a fluctuating external time source. Humanome‘s varying click and limited session time enhances focus and engagement in ways a metronome doesn’t. Humanome stresses the importance of the phrase and allows for odd time signatures.\n\nEach Humanome session is randomly generated and unique. A session is around 3 minutes long and has three parts: an initial 2-phrase segment of straight time, followed by the main body of the session’s shifting tempos, followed by a 1-phrase ending segment of straight time.\n\n\n\nSetting up each session: \n\nSpeed is the Humanome’s initial tempo, from 1 to 5.\n\nIntensity is how frequently the tempo will change. \n\nBeats per measure indicates time signature. By default, Humanome accentuates the first beat of each measure. This can be disabled in More Settings.\n\nSelect INHUMANOME if you want to kick the Humanome into true madness from any Intensity setting. Tempo changes will be much more severe. This gives you four additional intensities. \n\n \n\nMore Settings:\n\nMeasures per phrase. Much of the world’s music comes in 4 or 8 bar phrases and that is Humanome’s default setting. You can change that here.\n\n*2 multiplies each Speed setting by two, from *1 to *5.\n\n \n\nRemember:\n\nIt’s not a metronome.\n\nIt’s a Humanome.\n\nGO!"

It's not a standalone player, but an extension that turns your existing audio player into a Sonos-like multiroom solution.\nAudio is captured by the server and routed to the connected clients. Several players can feed audio to the server in parallel and clients can be grouped to play the same audio stream.\nOne of the most generic ways to use Snapcast is in conjunction with the music player daemon (MPD) or Mopidy."

      "label": "Helium is a lightweight AUv3 MIDI sequencer plugin designed specifically for AUM. It supports up to 16 tracks of unlimited length with the ability to direct output to 16 channels on up to 16 MIDI output ports.\n\nOne of the great features is the ability to import and maintain libraries of MIDI clips using Helium's 'Media Bay'. These clips are freely available all over the internet and may contain individual chord sets, chord progressions or drum tracks. You can quickly build a song by dragging and dropping your MIDI clips from the media bay onto your timeline. You can also save your own clips directly to the media bay to create your own personal MIDI clips libraries. Long press on a clip to preview its contents using the currently selected MIDI device.\n\nHelium now ships with a library of over 7000 MIDI clips, consisting of every chord and chord progression you could ever need.\n\nHelium allows many different ways to import additional MIDI clip libraries. Simply drag and drop your ZIP collections directly to your PC/MAC web browser and they are automatically unpacked into the clips library folder. You can also drag and drop files between the Media Bay and the iOS Files app.\n\nHelium supports a sync mode called 'Remote Looping'. This was something we recently introduced into our MultiTrack Recorder plugin and is very useful for breaking down the timeline into sections.  You can define up to 12 loops which can be used to specify the locations of say the intro, verse, chorus, and outro within your song, then trigger these loops seemlessly in sync with the host tempo. Once captured, these loops can then be triggered by incoming MIDI notes.\n\nA new addition to Helium is the ability to piece together loops into songs, so you just concentrate on creating a single verse, chorus, bridge etc. and piece everything together without the headache of having to re-arrange your timeline.\n\nFeatures\n\n○ 16 Tracks per instance.\n○ Includes a library of over 7000 MIDI clips.\n○ Assignable MIDI channel and Bus per track.\n○ Full editing of CC controllers using the controller lane.\n○ Independent vertical and horizontal zooming.\n○ Import & Export MIDI tracks.\n○ Media Bay, organize your MIDI flips libraries.\n○ Clip Preview from Media Bay\n○ Drag and Drop from the Media Bay directly to the timeline.\n○ Drag and Drop to Files App.\n○ Remote Control with Looping advanced functionality.\n○ Step Recording.\n○ Build in Mixer to adjust relative track levels with Mute/Solo.\n○ Sync to Host.\n○ Up to 16 outputs (configurable).\n○ MIDI Clip Preview\n○ Ghost Note Feature\n○ Multi level undo and redo.\n○ Song Mode\n○ Multi-Take Record\n\nPlease checkout the help manual for details on where to find my tutorial videos on Helium and where to download some fully featured and free MIDI clip libraries.\n\nThis is not recommended to use on small iPhone screen sizes such as the SE models. You can adjust the screen scaling to suite your iPhone model by long pressing the MENU button and changing the scale."

And, thanks to BLEASS’ super-intuitive interface design, that entire sonic palette is within easy reach of even the most non-technical of musicians.\n\nMegalit includes many innovations that will empower your sound designs:\n- Advanced wavetable oscillators can adjust both wavetable position and fold, bringing near-infinite variety to each of the synth’s 130+ wavetables;\n- Per-oscillator unison mode allows you to create complex layering that would normally require you to load additional synths into your project;\n- Noise generator with dedicated high- and low-pass filtering for super-flexible non-tonal sounds and sound components.\n- Resonant high-pass and low-pass filters that can be applied to individual oscillators or pairs of oscillators, as can the built-in waveshaper and bit-crusher processors;\n- Four LFOs, each with its own timing curve and output smoothing, that allow for the creation of exceptionally complex – not to mention original – modulation patterns;\n- Advanced Motion Sequencer for the creation of complex repeating modulation patterns;\n- Per-patch storage of performance controller response curves ensure a sound will always respond the way you expect it to;\n- Patch randomising feature always produces useable sounds;\n- Built-in multi-band upward/downward compressor provides exquisite control over a sound’s dynamics and punchiness.\n\nAll of Megalit’s parameters, settings and controls, no matter how advanced, are laid out at your fingertips, with intuitive visual feedback ensuring you always know exactly what the synth is doing. And, despite its huge sonic power, Megalit is super-efficient on your system, leaving you with plenty of headroom for running additional instruments and effects… or, better still, more instances of Megalit!\n\n\nBLEASS Megalit is available as an AUv3 plugin or standalone App.\nBLEASS Megalit is also available for Window & Mac Users.\nMore information available on https://www.bleass.com/megalit"

      "label": "Copperhead is an AUv3 digital subtractive synthesizer plugin which draws its influence from the vintage synthesizers of the early 80's. Only now we have full polyphony, a build in arpeggiator, an a host of integrated effects. It features such as the ability to design custom waveforms, oscillator sync and various cross modulation modes. Cross modulation is a type of FM synthesis which can be used to morph simplistic waveforms into something far more aggressive and interesting.\n\nAt the heart of Copperhead are its two oscillators, which support all your traditional waveforms (SINE,SQR,SAW,TRI), as well as SuperSaw, Trapezium, and a user definable type. The app features pulse wave modulation for multiple sources, and the ability to sync oscillators.\n\nThe Voltage Controller Filter supports the usual LP, HP, BP and Notch filters, as well as a couple of unusual ones like Formant which allows you to sweep your cutoff to create interesting vowel sounds.\n\nCopperhead also features twin LFO's with random and one shot functionality. It also supports Cross, Ring and FM modulators, in addition to low and high shelf filters.\n\nOne of the great features is the integrated audio gate, which allows you to generate stuttering audio right out of the box. Combined with effects such as Chorus, Overdrive, Delay, Reverb and Auto Pan / Tremelo, and the ability to specify effect order, you have a lot of control over your sound.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, we also include a 32 step sequencer, with various mono and poly modes with direct control control of various synth elements.\n\nWe have a built in Preset Manager which groups presets into banks and groups, which supports drag and drop for easy import/export of presets. You can also access your favourites from a special popup menu, or via the built in quick search facility.\n\n○ AUv3 compatible.\n○ Up to 16 note polyphony.\n○ 7 Oscillator wave types.\n○ Sub Oscillator.\n○ PW/PWM on SQR and TRP waveforms.\n○ Supports SuperSaw with MIX and DETUNE.\n○ XMod / Ring and FM modulations.\n○ Osc Sync.\n○ 6 types of VCF filter.\n○ Low and High shelf on output.\n○ Built in compressor.\n○ Chorus, Delay, Overdrive, Reverb and Auto Pan effects.\n○ Built in Audio Gate.\n○ Preset Manager with Bank/Group/Preset section.\n○ Supports drag and drop to import/export presets, groups and banks.\n○ Supports web transfer of presets.\n○ 32 step arpeggiator.\n \nNOTE: This is an AUv3 plugin which was designed to be hosted in DAW's such as AUM, Cubasis, GarageBand, Loopy Pro etc."

      "label": "Make music at the speed of sound!\nMinimic allows you to directly record short clips from your microphone and play them at different notes, loop them, pitch them and add a ton of effects! You can sequence those little clips in a user-friendly tracker-like interface to shape your song.\nThis is one of the fastest sample based tracker for mobile, you’ll be creating a complete song in no-time! Very useful for beatbox music or song drafts. \n\nHow to make a song in a few simple steps (later explained in the in-app tutorial):\n1) Open the instrument editor and press the big red button to record a new sample.\n2) Polish your sample by adding loop points and removing any silent part it can have.\n3) Use the main tracker-like interface to place notes. Minimic auto detects the pitch of your sample so any musical sound you have recorded will be automatically in tune!\n4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 as much as you like!\n5) By opening the pattern list menu you can add more and more patterns sections to increase and set the order of your song blocks!\n6) Save your song into .mic (project) or export .wav audio files!\n7) Enjoy!\n\nPlot twist! Think inside the box: You can have only a max of 6 sounds playing back at the same time and your clips could be of a max of 1 second (but you can make them loop in ping-pong (start to end and back)).\n\nShow us what you can do with Minimic!\n\nFeedback is appreciated at: staff@minimic.app"

      "label": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required."

      "label": "Biophilia is an extraordinary and innovative multimedia exploration of music, nature and technology by the musician Björk. Comprising a suite of original music and interactive, educational artworks and musical artifacts, Biophilia is released as ten in-app experiences that are accessed as you fly through a three-dimensional galaxy that accompanies the album’s theme song Cosmogony. All of the album’s songs are available inside Biophilia as interactive experiences: Crystalline, Virus, Moon, Thunderbolt, Sacrifice, Mutual Core, Hollow, Solstice, and Dark Matter.\n\nBjörk has collaborated with artists, designers, scientists, instrument makers, writers and software developers to create an extraordinary multimedia exploration of the universe and its physical forces, processes and structures - of which music is a part. Each in-app experience is inspired by and explores the relationships between musical structures and natural phenomena, from the atomic to the cosmic. You can use Biophilia to make and learn about music, to find out about natural phenomena, or to just enjoy Björk’s music. \n\nBiophilia opens into a three-dimensional galaxy with a compass allowing navigation between the 3-dimensional universe and a two-dimensional track list. Take a closer look by tapping on stars within the constellations and you’ll see that each is an in-app purchase that gives access to the inspired combination of artifacts for each new Björk song: interactive art and games, music notation which can be used to sing along karaoke-style, abstract animations, lyrics, and essays that explore Björk’s inspirations for the track. These artifacts bring together conventional and alternative ways of representing and making music to create an environment for entertainment and learning. Biophilia challenges the way we think about music. Here, for the first time, is a music album that exploits the multimedia capabilities of mobile interactive technologies. \n\nBiophilia was developed by Björk in collaboration with interactive artist and app developer Scott Snibbe, and Björk's longtime design collaborators M/M Paris. The individual apps were created by Luc Barthelet, Drew Berry, Kodama Studios, Stephen Malinowski, Scott Snibbe Studio, John Simon Jr., Touch Press, and Max Weisel.\n\nFeatures:\n\n•           Three-dimensional galactic interface with the song Cosmogony\n•           Nine song apps available as in-app purchases\n•           Music scores with karaoke playback \n•           Abstract song animation\n•           Lyrics\n•           Essays\n•           MIDI out to drive instruments"

It's an incredible tool for all audio engineers and musicians ... My mixing has improved by leaps and bounds after just a few weeks with Quiztones.”\n\n- Austin McAllister\n\n\nA professional Audio Engineer of 10 years, I've come across many ear training devices, blind tests, and software. This app is TOPS! Highly recommended! The developers are serious about what they do. You will not be disappointed!\n\n- Joel Avery\n\n——\n\nWhy We Created Quiztones EQ Ear Training Apps ...\n\nWe thought there should be an easier way to learn how to use EQ, train your ears and expedite the path to getting professional quality mixes, recordings and productions.\n\nWhen I was at music school ten years ago studying audio engineering and music production, my teacher turned an iMac around, pulled up an EQ in Pro Tools and started quizzing the class on which audio frequencies he was boosting or cutting in a mix. That's when it hit me — this should be an app, with various difficulty levels, a scoring system and the ability to import your own source material for quizzes that will teach you how to use EQ like a pro.\n\nFast forward to today — 50k app downloads later — and we're still just as excited to keep evolving Quiztones to help you take the quality of your mixes, recordings and productions to the next level."

Rock on!!!\" Ge Wang, Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Creative Officer of Smule (creators of Magic Piano) \n\n\"Jordan's very capable use of his unique invention- MorphWiz must be a Godsend to his road crew. It's important to note that no Moog synthesizers were harmed in its production.\" \nKeith Emerson. \n\n\"It's completely awesome and inspiring to play! \nAbsolutely loving it!\" \nEric Persing-Spectrasonics \n\nMorphWiz is the second app to bear the Jordan Rudess name. MorphWiz is partly inspired by the Haken Continuum Fingerboard, a radically innovative and revolutionary MIDI instrument that Jordan uses on stage and in the studio with Dream Theater. \n\nLike the Continuum, Jordan Rudess' MorphWiz is a vertical grid based musical instrument that allows a whole new level of expressive control! \n\nIf you're a beginner, you’ll love experimenting with all of the presets, but if you’re a professional musician, you will soon be blown away by one of the coolest methods of controlling sound that you've ever laid hands on. \n\nJordan states, “Our goal was to create an instrument that would allow the seamless morphing of the audio and visual domain while delivering a seamless musical experience. I believe the iPhone/iPad multitouch platform opens up a whole new world of creation of electronic musical instruments and we’re proud MorphWiz is our first major offering. My experience and involvement with the Haken Continuum and extraordinary Bebot app brought to life an advanced pitch control system that is still uncharted territory for many in today’s music instrument world. This is the heart of MorphWiz.” \n\nMorphWiz video tutorials: \nhttp://www.morphwiz.com/tutorial.html \n\nOver 80 Jordan Rudess-created patches \n\nFEATURES: \n\n• Assign audio waveforms as visual shapes to the grid and morph between them with your fingers on the grid or the accelerometer \n• Advanced pitch control allows the player to round the pitch of the initial attack of any note. It also recognizes when your finger stops after a slide, and rounds your notes to the nearest diatonic pitch \n• Rounding pitch on initial attack and/or after a slide \n• Independent control for up to 10 simultaneous notes \n• Finger Vibrato Effect (FVE) where you can achieve vibrato even when lock pitch is selected and the pitch is snapping to the grid! \n• Velocity Controlled Animation (VCA) in sync with your musical performance \n• Trippy full-color, animated particles, fire, and ring effects visually radiate under your fingertips and contain real time pitch information \n• Choose from a wide variety of scales and chords to assign to the playing surface with easy customization \n• Choose to display names of notes or intervals to help guide you \n• Performance controls include octave shift, pitch lock on/off, record to delay buffer on/off, infinity delay setting on/off, and multi-function slider \n• Unison detuning effect with separate pan control for that classic analog thickness \n• FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis can be assigned to the vertical grid or accelerometer \n• Wave Sync Synthesis (WSS) can also be assigned to the vertical grid or accelerometer \n• Adjustable note attack and release time \n• FX include digital delay, stereo chorus, and tremolo\n\n“Check out Jordan Rudess’s new album with Steve Horelick entitled “interSonic”which features MorphWiz!”"

Everything from the pad layouts, scales, new graphics to the sounds work together really well. Also, the new sounds are really, really good (great strings and choir samples). IMHO that this app just quadrupled in value with this free update.\" - Music-311\n\n\"Thanks for such an awesome app, I love that it lets you intuitively visualize and experiment with a \"Tonnetz\" layout, and better understand Neo-Riemannian theory - as such, Navichord is the perfect gateway from abstract, heady harmony concepts to immediate and practical music being played- a priceless possibility! And it looks beautiful and the tones are great, to boot\" - RepentHarlequin73\n\n\"This is really a nice, simple, clean app. I love the way you laid out the UI and I especially like that single notes can be tapped first and then dragged seamlessly between notes to produce the chord, then back to another single note if desired. For what it's worth, here are five stars... ***** This app will replace several other more expensive \"chord progression lab\" apps that I own because I think it's UI design is excellent and perfect for my needs.\" - ZenLizard\n\n\"Find using the harmonic grid more intuitive than a piano keyboard, being able to press in the middle of three circles to get major and minor chords is genius. Experimenting with chord patterns and having the chord name at the top and the root and other keys displayed on the keyboard, is helping me get my head around more complex chords.\" - mister-rz\n\n\"Downloaded the app when I read about it on dischord. I'm really happy...looks like a great app to explore chord variations.\" - Jonathan Paran Aran\n\n\"Read about it on Synthtopia. Bought it just now, love it already. Thanks Denis!\" - Dominik Assig\n\n\"Excelente app para aprender acordes y armonia.\" - R3dhood\n\n\"It can definitely be a source of inspiration.\" - Luca\n\n\"...it helps (when it comes to chord progressions). It is so simple & that is its value.\" - Michael L\n\n\"I use and love Navichord!\" - Ep Lipschitz"

      "label": "Create surprising rhythms and harmonies by having colored shapes follow arrows on a two-dimensional grid.\n\nNew Path is a unique and playful tool that drastically changes the way you make music. Pick an instrument for each square or triangle (shapes) and let them walk around. Rotate the arrows to alter their paths. Now choose from an exotic list of arrow types to spice things up.\n\nShapes also have a mind of their own. By using crossroads and teleports they will have to decide for themselves which direction to take. This phenomenon will give you endless surprising results, but you’ll be able to keep full control by adjusting each crossroad/teleport bias.\n\n• Use the factory sets to play around and have lots of fun instantly! Or,\n• Create your own sets with the many features available!\n\n\nEach arrow contains adjustable values such as pitch, note duration, volume, etc, while shapes can interpret these values in their own way. For instance, a shape can add an octave to each pitch it comes across, so it will play all the notes one octave higher. \n\nUse delay and reverb to add flavor, use the advanced preset and generator systems to save and modify the grid, use the rules system to determine what should happen when two shapes meet, and much more.\n\nNew Path is also able to communicate with other hard- & software. With the MIDI out feature, New Path can control for example your hardware synthesizers. Use the Ableton Link feature to sync Link-enabled devices and play together with your friends. And finally, the Audiobus integration lets you send both audio and MIDI to other apps on your device (You will need the Audiobus app).\n\nKey Features\n• A well thought out interface designed for both fast editing and playing live on-stage\n• Have surprising results with exotic arrow types such as crossroads and teleports\n• 70+ instruments such as Drums, Bass, Plucked, Synths, Acoustic, and Fx\n• Midi editor with a scales system\n• Many useful shape settings such as: Attack, Release, Note Value Multiplier to make non-western rhythms, etc\n• A preset system to instantly save and recall grid and shape settings\n• An advanced grid generator/modulator\n• A system of “If-Then” rules to trigger actions when shapes meet each other\n• A mixer with Delay and Reverb\n• 5x5 Arrow Cells with data such as: velocity, note duration, note value, repeat chance, crossroad chance, CC out, and much more…\n• 9 Tutorials with example sets to get you started \n\nNew Path supports\n• Ableton Link\n• iCloud device sync\n• iCloud export/import\n• Audiobus support (midi and audio)\n• Midi out \n\nIn-App Purchase\n• Arrow Skins\n• Instrument Expansion Pack\n• Audio Unit v3 (AUv3)\n\nAbout AUv3\n• In case you bought New Path before 28th December 2022 (for $6.99), email a screenshot with proof of your purchasing date and we’ll email a promo code for the AUv3 feature (info@studiothezooo.com)\n\nGet New Path today to create a treasury of musical gems! \n\n* Runs on iPhone 5s with iOS 11.0 and above"

      "label": "Bebot is a musical instrument that anyone can play. Instead of a keyboard, it has an easy-to-use touch control system. And it's all built into a friendly animated robot, who performs your music while you play.\n\nAlthough it looks simple on the outside, inside is a powerful synth engine which lets you create and edit your own sounds and apply effects. The controls are easy to use, making it fun to tinker and experiment with sound. If you just want to get playing, there's also a wide selection of preset sounds.\n\nThe touch control system lets you lock in a scale so that you'll never play a wrong note, which makes it easy to play, even on your iPhone. It's polyphonic, which means you can use multiple fingers at once to play chords and harmonies. Plus, you can perform sweeping slides and expressive gestures that would be practically impossible on a regular keyboard.\n\nWhile it's designed to be simple and fun, that doesn't mean it's only for beginners. Bebot has been used both on stage and in the studio by accomplished musicians and performers including Dream Theater, How To Destroy Angels and The Flaming Lips.\n\nTo see and hear Bebot in action, check out the demo videos at normalware.com, including a walkthrough demo by keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess.\n\nNow with Audiobus and Inter-App Audio, you can connect Bebot to other apps such as GarageBand to record, multitrack and add effects, making Bebot more versatile and useful than ever.

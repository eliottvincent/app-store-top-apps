Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera.

Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

      "label": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

      "label": "Reeflex is the best photography app on the App Store designed for enthusiasts, creatives, and professional photographers! The app provides pro-level DSLR features directly on your iPhone while being intuitive and easy to use in every situation.\r\n\r\n--- Professional Tools for Everyone ---\r\n\r\nReeflex offers a rich set of professional tools for full manual control over focus, exposure, and white balance. The live histograms combined with the zebra stripes allow you to precisely monitor your exposure. The focus peaking is a powerful guide for adjusting the focus over your subject. By a simple two-finger tap on the viewfinder, Reeflex also offers the possibility to independently adjust focus and exposure, moving two convenient reticles across the scene.  \r\n\r\nReeflex allows shooting in HEIF, JPG, TIFF, or RAW on all iPhone models. For compatible devices, you can also shoot in the Apple ProRAW format. \r\n\r\n--- Slow Shutter Mode --- \r\n\r\nReeflex offers the best long exposure tools on the App Store. Enjoy the flexibility of manual controls and watch the picture forming on the screen. Select either motion blur or light trails to make people disappear, give moving water a smooth silky appearance, or capture the movement of the night sky for stunning star trails. It has never been easier, the only limit is your creativity. \r\n\r\nOnly a few days after its launch, Reeflex was listed as “Must Have APPS - You Never Heard About!” by the highly popular iReviews YouTube channel. Check out the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M2PjNFbIjM\r\n\r\n--- MAIN FEATURES ---\n\r\n• Motion blur\r\n• Light trails\r\n• Wide range of selectable exposure duration, from 0.5 s to 2 hours.\r\n• Bulb mode for custom exposure duration\r\n• Full manual controls over ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance\r\n• Focus and exposure reticles \r\n• Luma and RGB zebra stripes\r\n• Live RGB and luma histograms \r\n• Advanced focus peaking \r\n• Support for multiple cameras\r\n• Apple’s ProRAW* and RAW** support\r\n• JPEG, HEIF, or TIFF as processed formats\r\n• GPS location in photos’ metadata\r\n• Gyroscopic tiltmeter\r\n\r\n--- ADDITIONAL FEATURES --- \r\n\r\n• Extended digital zoom up to 10x. \r\n• Integrated camera roll.\r\n• Customization of focus peaking color\r\n• Tutorials, tips, and detailed explanations in the settings section.\r\n\r\n--- WHAT'S COMING NEXT --- \r\n\r\nWe are working hard to include more advanced features such as:\r\n• RAW long exposures\r\n• Hand-held long exposures\r\n• Time-lapse, intervalometer, and bracketing\r\n\r\n--- REMARKS ---\r\n\r\n*ProRAW is only supported on iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 pro max. On other devices, when RAW mode is selected, photos will be saved in the Bayer RAW format. RAW mode requires an iPhone 6s or later.\r\n**On devices older than the iPhone 12, the RAW format is not supported on the ultrawide camera.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for new updates!\r\nWe'd love to hear from you and get your feedback.

Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nThis app is brought to you by the developers of Video & TV Cast, the #1 video casting app in the world with more than 100.000.000 downloads across all platforms and devices.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with any of the trademarks mentioned here."

Thankfully, you have your trusty iPhone or iPad!  \n\nOK!  Now what??\n\nDo you know the tips and tricks to take photos of the northern lights ? Great, if you do!

ISO, shutter speed, long exposure mode, temperature, check check check. There are 3 presets that you can choose from based on the brightness of the aurora lights that you're seeing.  Those don't work? Try out custom mode until you get that 'good-enough-for-me-to-show-to-my-friends' snap and take as many photos as you'd like!\n\nWorth a shot !

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* Sound is not yet supported, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

From 4 minutes to 1/8000 sec., aperture from 1.0 to 512 and iso from 3 to 6400.\n\n• Automatic priority for aperture or speed. (Automatic Av and Tv modes).\n\n• Automatic ISO or locked ISO options.\n\n• Point metering in camera view.\n\n• Maximum aperture limited by the selected lens.\n\n• Calculate the average of any number of measurements you want.\n\n• Read the exposure data of any photo from the gallery.\n\n• Calculate hyperfocal distance for 5 memorized lenses. Which also blocks maximum aperture.\n\n• Memory for 5 lenses with maximum aperture, focal length and film/sensor size for calculating hyperfocal distance and aperture.\n\n• Hyperfocal distance also for infrared light. (IR button)\n\n• Exposure value EV on an analog scale or right up front.\n\n• Two LED indicators show whether the measurement is unreliable due to lack of light in the scene, or if we have under 30% battery left.\n\n• On 3.5 \" displays preset lens buttons tilting the device or tapping at the bottom.\n\n• Be advised that accurate incident light reading needs a diffuser attached to the front camera. Without the diffuser still can be used but think about it, it will be a reflected reading taken with the front camera.\n\nI'm an independent photographer/designer/developer and am very grateful for your support. Trying to do the best lightmeter app ever, a lot more to come. You can ask for any improvement and I'll be happy to help. This app is constantly reviewed and improved because it is my tool, if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me by email at davidquiles@me.com\n\nThank you!\n\nDavid Quiles"

      "label": "Obscura 3 is a camera app packed full of features to help you take incredible photos. Obscura pairs a stunning design with intuitive controls that make taking photos a delight.\n—\n\nObscura 2 has been featured numerous times by Apple around the world, including as Editor’s Choice and App of the Day. And Obscura 3 is even better.\n—\n\nDesign\n\nObscura squeezes a bunch of powerful features into simple controls anyone can master. The interface balances aesthetics, ergonomics, and intuitiveness. You won’t want to use anything else. All the camera controls can be reached with one thumb, and gestures and haptics combine to create a tactile experience that lets you stay focused on your subject.\n—\n\nAppearance\nThemes, manual light and dark modes, custom app icons. All gorgeous. \n—\n\n\nCamera Features\n—\n\nModes\nObscura 3 has been designed around 5 distinct camera modes: \nPhoto - simple, fast performance\nPro Photo - maximum control \nDepth - portraits & depth data\nLive Photo - for.. Live Photos\nVideo - video capture with pro controls\n\nExposure\nTo adjust exposure, just touch your thumb to the Exposure Button and move it in a circle, like turning a dial. Couldn’t be simpler and it feels great. And you can just tap the button to instantly reset the exposure bias.\n\nFocus\nJust like exposure, drag your thumb around the Focus Button to focus manually. And you’ll get both a focus loupe and focus peaking to help you get your subject perfectly crisp. ^1\n\nISO & Shutter Speed\nTK\n\nWhite Balance\nAWB, White Point, Scene Presets, and manual Temp + Tint.\n\nPhoto Formats\nProRAW ^2, RAW, HEIC, and JPEG photos, Live Photos and Depth Data ^3. \n\nVideo Formats\n1080p or 4K at 24,30 or 60fps ^4\n\nFilters\nLots of new filters, some old favorites. You can now disable filters and set favorites for quick access. All included.\n\nAspect Ratio\nCapture photos in 4:3, 1:1, 16:9, and 2:1 aspect ratios.\n\nHistogram\nSmall or large, luminance or color.\n\nGrid\nLines, crosshairs, or none.\n\nSpirit Level\nFor perfectly level horizons that would make Wes Anderson proud.\n\nFlash\nYep.\n\nTimer\nI hear tick tock is really popular with the youths.\n\nPresets\nCustomise Obscura to your heart’s content, and save those customisations into presets to quickly access at any time.\n—\n \nLibrary\n\nNot only has the camera interface been redesigned, but the library has been reconsidered from the ground up to give you quick access to your most important photos, without sacrificing performance.\n—\n\nView Options\nObscura lets you configure exactly what’s displayed in the library views, so you can hide screenshots and memes to help you focus on your photos.\n\nYou can also adjust the size of thumbnails to suit your preference. And keep hidden photos hidden. Naturally.\n—\n\nImage View & Editing\nBrowse, share, fav, rate, edit. Whether you want to dig into metadata, triage through your vacation photos, or apply some cool filters, you’ll find it here.\n—\n\n\nSettings & More\nObscura’s Settings has a bunch of options, allowing you to manage filters, tweak camera behaviours, change the theme, read the walkthrough and more.\n—\n\nApple Watch Support\nUse your Apple Watch as a camera remote. You can change capture mode, set exposure and more!\n—\n\nGame Controller Support (Beta)\nIt’s a little rough, but yes, you can use a game controller to control your camera.\n———\n\n\n1. Manual Focus only available in single camera modes, not while using a Virtual Dual or Triple camera. Yes, this sucks but the virtual cameras are weird and full of quirks\n2. ProRAW only available on iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro\n3. Depth Data only available on Dual, Triple, or TrueDepth Camera systems\n4. Video formats vary by device\n\nThanks for checking out Obscura. If you decide to buy, we hope you’ll consider rating it, or sharing with someone you think might like it. \n\nAll the best,\nBen & Adam"

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any video you want on your Amazon Fire TV (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet.

All you need to do is drag, grow or shrink the body parts you want to distort. Find out how you would look like with a different nose, chin, buttock, less weight... \n\nOur app, downloaded 10 million times on all platforms worldwide stands out because of 2 particular features:\n\n1) The distortion algorithm we are using produce very smooth image distortions, such as the ones you find in 100x more expensive professional liquify apps. \n\n 2) Our dual display mode, which clones your image into the other half of the screen when you rotate your device, allows you to modify your image without the encumbrance of your finger hiding the area you are working on. This is ideal for small touch devices such as your phone !!\n\n- New Feature: You can now save morphing animations as videos! \n\n************************ \nWHAT CAN THE APP DO? \n************************ \n\nWith this photo distortion app you can transform any face and body part:\n\n• Nose reshaping\n• Lips augmentation \n• Chin and face contouring \n• Weight loss \n• Muscle augmentation \n• anything you can reshape or shrink! \n\nFor fun or simply because you are curious about how you would look with a differently shaped body part, this app will help you.\n\n\n************************ \nHOW TO USE THE APP? \n************************ \n\nUsing the app is very easy, even on small screens: \n\n• Import a head-shot or full body picture from your camera or device image library. Preferably the subject should be photographed on a unified color background and well lit, so the contours are clearly visible. \n\n• Use your finger to drag or shrink the body parts that you want distorted. For example you can crush this bump on your nose, or even make you slimmer. \n\n• Undo latest changes if you are not satisfied with latest modifications. \n\n• By rotating your device, switch from single to dual view, to easily compare the before / after images on the same screen. \n\n• Zoom in, and use the dual view to see your changes on a real time workspace mirror without your finger in the way. This is a great solution to perform precise distortions on small screens!! \n\n• Launch a morphing animation between the original photo and the modified one to see the old you transforming into the new you! \n\nDownload our app now. Then see how those changes you’ve been wanting to see might look."

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any online video on your Chromecast (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Chromecast. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Chromecast immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n* The app only works with a Chromecast 1+2+Ultra by Google and on devices with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. \n\n* If a specific video does not cast, please check our FAQ. If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for your video as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Chromecast. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Subtitles: Display subtitles & closed captions on TV.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> USER FEEDBACKS\n\n\"You've brought the chromecast to life on iOS devices!! And you designed it work easily and quickly\"\nRyan, England\n\n“I looooove your app. It has taken my Chromecast to a whole new level.”\nRosalind Romero, USA\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nWe want to say thank you for all your great support and kindly invite you to honestly rate our app. This helps us to keep up our app development and support for you. Please do not trust other apps that ask you for 5-star ratings in exchange for premium upgrades. This is against good developer ethics and also against Apple guidelines.\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or other request, please notify us at info@video-tv-cast.com\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here.

It is recalling the images you took 72 hours later, when 80% of your memory has blurred and faded away, will turn your short-term memory into long-term memory. Our team also has attempted to reproduce the in-the-moment experience of taking photos by eliminating the Instant Review feature found on conventional digital cameras and reducing 95 % of the conventional viewfinder feature, leaving only the bare minimum needed for taking shots.\n\n\"Gudak-dari Camera\", as its name suggests, refers to a time-worn and antique camera. Living in a digital generation where \"Un-do\" function is prevalent, we may have lost\n\nthe thrill of making new and conscious decisions. \"Patients is a virtue\" has faded its original value and people are getting used to selecting one palatable photo out of a myriad of photos. Amid this so-called \"digitalization\", we hope you to recall the thrill of making new choices by seizing the \"Gudak Moment\".\n\nGudak 3.2 Update has added a self-camera feature that allows you to shoot with a front camera as Gudak feels.\nExperience a new look of Gudak and a variety of emotional photos with front cameras as well as rear cameras. The theme will be updated further in the future.\n\n*The Lecoq film is only available in Korea.\n\nAlso, for those who feel that Gudak photos are dark, you can adjust the brightness of photos through the newly added ISO (based on world standard film sensitivity).\n\nA Gudakbook icon has been added to make Gudak photos a real album. Try to experience the feeling of those days through Gudakbook like the excitement I felt when printing the film camera. You can apply for Gudakbook through the print icon on the Printed Envelope Check page.\n\n\n[Explanation of Authority ]\n\nEssential access authority\n- Cameras: Camera access for photography\n- Save: External Storage Read/Write permissions for photoshooting, storing, and bringing in\n\nSelective access\n* You can use the service without agreeing to access rights.\n- Location: Location access to tag location information in pictures"

Choose from 4 packs of models ranging from simple geometric shapes to complex, architectural structures. Once you’ve chosen your object, select from a range of visual styles to make it reflective or refractive, opaque or translucent. Output high resolution images and even videos. \n\nMake your edits even more realistic by adding and adjusting the model’s shadow. Fine-tune the shadow's position, opacity, and strength. Use the built-in masking tools to erase portions of your model or shadow to seamlessly blend it into your photo's environment. \n\nUse the unique video export feature to create short animated loops of the object spinning, pulsing, and hovering in your photo. Adjust the rotation speed and direction for a different effect every time. \n\nDiscover, experiment, and create fantastic edits using the free background images in the \"Free for All\" photo browser. Free for Alls are community photos that you can freely edit and share. They are contributed by amazing artists that support the mobile photo editing community.

      "label": "Watch webvideos, online movies, live tv streams and your personal photos, videos & music on your DLNA powered TV, video game console or blu-ray player. Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nBrowse the web and stream your favorite webvideo or online TV show on a DLNA player like Samsung TV, LG TV, Sony TV, Philips TV, Toshiba TV, Panasonic TV, Xbox 360, Xbox One, EZCast, WD TV, Kodi (XBMC), SONOS and many other devices that use DLNA / UPnP / AllShare. Please try the free app version to check if your specific DLNA player is supported.\n\nMp4, m3u8, hls live streaming, video over https and of course Full HD are supported. And there is no time limit at all! Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for video link detection and send the video with a single tap to your DLNA player. The discovered link is shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. \n\n* The app only works with a DLNA player that is capable of \"media rendering\". \n\n* Sony Bravia TVs: Please enable the renderer function of your TV to enable casting. See http://bit.ly/1VKM60A\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please use the hardware remote of your DLNA player to forward, rewind and pause a running video.\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to try it multiple times until it works on your specific DLNA player.\n\n* If a video does not cast, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. FAQ did not help? Please drop us a mail and give us the chance to help you before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can enable/disable it at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Add and manage as many bookmarks as you want, either in the bookmarks menu or directly in the browser.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: After purchasing this you can set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nPlease note that this app may not work with all DLNA devices out there. But we are working hard to improve this app with every update. Your feedback will drive our work ahead and you'll see improvements and new features in the next update. Please send your feedback to info@video-tv-cast.com\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with the Digital Living Network Alliance or any other trademark mentioned here."

      "label": "LED aquarium lights are brilliant, but blue (actinic) light interferes with your camera sensor, changing the beautiful colors of your fish and corals into a scene from a black light filled roller rink from the 1980's.\n\nEnter our hopeful hero, Aquarium Camera. It dreams of ridding the internet of bad aquarium photography. It's designed to color correct the actinic light from LEDs in real-time on our mobile devices, the thing we use to take photos of everything else in our lives, except our tanks... until now. \n\n\"The Aquarium Camera app is an essential tool for reef tank photography.\" – ReefBuilders.com\n\nYou can now stop buying pro camera rigs, shooting in raw, buying gels, and turning off your blue lights to get great and accurate shots of your tank. You don't need to spend hours in post-production or photo editing apps, tweaking the hue and lighting of each of your photos. Simply put, all you need is the Aquarium Camera and an iPad or iPhone to get GREAT photos and videos of your aquarium. \n\n“So easy to use…  Love it!!!  And the color changing is realtime so you can see the screen and the real thing side by side to ensure you get the right balance.” \n– Carlos Chacon, IT Manager at CoralVue\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Real-time white balance color\n• Real-time RGB adjustment\n• *NEW* Real-time Gel mode - orange gels are typically used by professional photographers to compensate for blue light. The new gel mode works like magic by simulating what a gel over your lens will do to your shots. It goes a step further by dynamically changing it's color based on what it sees in your shot (it's like buying millions of gels and picking just the right one for each shot)\n• Take Photos or Video\n• Portrait and Landscape photos (obviously)\n• Digital pinch to zoom\n• Touch to focus\n• Manually control brightness\n• Toggle the flash on/off (works great if your corals are really close to the glass in your aquarium)\n• Download it one time and use on your iPad and iPhone\n• Quickly access your camera roll to review shots\n• Share photos or videos right from the library\n\nSpecial thanks to the members of Reef2Reef.com for testing version 3.0 of the app! Over 250 aquarists tested version 3.0 prior to pushing to the app store. Check out the Reef2Reef, ReefCentral, Nano-Reef and ChicagoReefs forums to see some of their awesome aquarium photos! Super big thanks to Reef2Reef members Jason Mack, Scott Nelson, Scurvy, NorthFLreefer, ReeferMadness80G, Budau18 and Stratru362 for giving me permission to use their photos in the preview!\n\nI created the Aquarium Camera app because I was tired of seeing posts of brilliant aquariums on forums like Reef2Reef, Nano-Reef, ReefCentral that don't truly represent the health and beauty of the fish, plants, and corals inside. It wasn't as big of a problem in the days of VHO, Power Compacts and Metal Halide lighting, but with LEDs now taking over the aquarium lighting space, we needed another solution. \n\nLet's commit ourselves to spending less time trying to correct the lighting on our aquarium photos and videos and more time enjoying our fish, shrimp, snails, plants, and corals... oh, and doing water changes.\n\nThe before and after shots in the preview were taken at the 2017 Aquatic Experience Kessil booth, A80 Tuna Blues. The video was taken under an AquaIllumination Nano LED fixture."

While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll."

      "label": "Have you ever wondered what it takes to get those perfect outdoor portrait or landscape shots when scrolling through your favorite photography app of choice? Helios helps you improve your photos by notifying you of four magical times of the day.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe golden hour is the period of daytime shortly after sunrise or before sunset, during which daylight is redder and softer than when the Sun is higher in the sky. The opposite period during twilight is the blue hour, just before sunrise or after sunset, when indirect sunlight is evenly diffused. Photography during magic hours is proven to result in better photos than pictures taken at any other time of the day. The app is available around the globe and works without internet connection. It's an essential tool for all photographers and videographers.\n\nDESIGN\nHelios features a beautiful design that follows iOS 12 design language with incredible precision, making the experience truly breathtaking. An elegant dark theme is also available.\n\nFEATURES\nWith advanced tools like augmented reality lens and built-in light meter, planning your photos has never been easier. Powerful calendar and map tool can predict magic hour times, as well as sun and moon positions with extreme accuracy for days, weeks or even months in advance. By saving other locations, you can make sure you'll be prepared to capture the world around you wherever life takes you. Daily notifications help you stay up to date with slightest changes in time and duration of sunset, sunrise and magic hours.\n\n\nFeatured by Apple on the App Store Today page. Picked as one of the best iOS apps by TechnoBuffalo and Apple User."

See below for more info\n• Zoom Control on supported lenses\n• Trigger Stills capture\n• Record Start/Stop\n• White Balance + Tint, including 5 helpful presets and Auto White Balance\n• Audio Controls\n• Trigger Autofocus (for supported electronic lenses with autofocus enabled on lens)\n• Off-speed frame rates\n• Aperture (for supported electronic lenses)\n• Shutter Angle\n• ISO\n• Auto-Exposure Control\n• Active Card\n• Power On/Off\n• Monitor Overlays\n• Codec & Resolution\n• Enter metadata in the Digital Slate (including location data from your iPhone or iPad if you give permission)\n• Control Lock - locks critical controls while recording, preventing accidental settings changes during takes\n\n\n-- Follow Focus --\nYou can now pull focus wirelessly right from your iPhone or iPad. There are some limitations outlined below.\n• Currently only fully supports Pocket 4K, but as of v1.4 we now have limited support for EF mount cameras - Pocket 6K, Ursa Mini Pro G1 & G2\n• The camera does not supply the app with any information on the lenses current focus distance, so the app will not update in real time if you pull focus manually on the lens\n• Due to the nature of bluetooth, focus pulls may not be 100% smooth. It works well for nice slow pulls, but fast pulls my not feel entirely natural and organic. Unfortunately this is a limitation of the available technology.\n• On EF mount cameras, we can only offset focus from its current position, with no broader knowledge of where the lens is in its focus range. This means that focus marks are not possible. In addition, focus pulls on EF mount cameras can be quite jerky depending on the lens in use.\n\n\n-- Playback Control --\nWith Bluetooth+ you can control the playback of clips right from your iOS device. There are some notable limitations at this point. Currently you can:\n• Start playing a clip, either forwards or backwards\n• Navigate between clips, either forwards or backwards\n\nFor now, you will not be able to:\n• Pause a clip that is already playing\n• Change the speed of a clip that is already playing\n• Control clip looping\n\n\n-- Zoom Control --\nControl the zoom level on supported lenses. For the most part, this will only work on MFT lenses with electronic zoom. We are currently unaware of EF lenses that support this feature\n\n\n-- Slate-Only Mode --\nAs the name suggests, this feature locks the app into Slate-Only mode, without the ability to change critical camera settings or start/stop recording. This means you can let an assistant keep metadata up to date without the fear of interfering with important camera settings."

Juxtaposer has the power and features of a professional creative tool, but is simple to use and just as importantly, it's fun!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Short tutorial videos will turn you into a photomontage artist in no time.\n- The new Magic Crop feature makes it super fast and easy to cut something out of your top image, thanks to a powerful Machine Learning model.\n- Your composite images are exported at the full resolution of the background image, even if it's huge (40 MP+)!\n- The image adjustment tools let you match your images' color and lighting, and fine-tune the look of your creation.\n- Zoom in to work on fine details with pixel-level accuracy.  \n- Add elements from as many photos as you like to your background image.\n- Load photos from your iPhone photo library,  Unsplash, Dropbox or Flickr, .\n- Share your photomontages on Twitter or Flickr.  Email them, or save them to your Dropbox.\n- Save your cutout images in the Stamp Manager for later use.

Experiment safely, you can always get back to where you started.\n- 20 blend modes (like Multiply, Screen and Overlay) let advanced iPhoneographers create unique effects.\n- The \"red mask\" view mode shows you just the top image with the erased parts in red. It is helpful when precisely cutting out an element.\n\n* WhatsOnIphone.com: \"The application works incredibly well and makes an otherwise challenging process simple and fun. It blows my mind that you can do such things on an iPhone.\"\n* TUAW: \"This $2.99 app is a lot of fun, as well as one of the best-executed compositing tools for a mobile device that I've ever seen.\"\n* IphoneAppReviews: \"Pretty much everyone, at some point in time, has had the uncontrollable urge to take a friend’s photo and do something truly evil with it.

      "label": "Intuitive yet powerful, Lumos accurately predicts the position of the sun and moon at any time, on any day, in any place. Whether you’re planning a photo shoot, a wedding, or a solar panel installation, tracking the sun and moon has never been easier!\n\nLumos is divided into six main modules:\n\n• The augmented reality view harnesses the power of AR to visually project past, present, or future sun and moon positions (and moon phases!) onto your surroundings, letting you perfectly visualize your plans.\n\n• The map view overlays the sun and moon positions for a given time and location onto a map of that location, letting you make plans from afar.\n\n• The Street View mode works like the AR view, but it takes advantage of Google Street View to allow you to envision sun and moon positions for remote locations (requires Lumos Pro).\n\n• The calendar view displays a simple list of rise/set times and moon phases throughout the year, letting you see the big picture at a glance. Tap a row to see the detailed ephemeris for that day.\n\n• The notifications module lets you sign up to receive notifications for significant solar and lunar events, including: astronomical, nautical, and civil dawn/dusk, blue hour, golden hour, sunrise/set, solar noon, moon rise/set, lunar transit, and lunar perigee/apogee (requires Lumos Pro).\n\n• The shadow length view calculates the exact length of the shadow an object will cast on a given time and day, letting you see the result both visually and numerically. You can also calculate the height of an object if you know the length of its shadow.\n\n\nWith an affordable one-time purchase of Lumos Pro, you can also:\n\n• Search for a location by name or manually enter coordinates\n\n• Save locations for later reference or offline use*\n\n• Take notes on a saved location and have them readily available the next time you view it\n\n\n*The map view and Street View do not currently support offline use\n\nNOTE: The sun and moon positions calculated by Lumos are accurate to within a small fraction of a degree. However, as with any augmented-reality app, the accuracy of the projection is dependent on the underlying hardware. If you are seeing inaccurate positions, please calibrate your device's compass and ensure that you are not near any sources of electromagnetic interference (e.g. microwaves, computers, car engines, high voltage lines). Phone cases containing batteries are known to cause compass interference. You can also use the visual calibration tool to align the projection with sun’s current position. Please feel free to contact us if you continue to have issues.\n\n_____________\n\nTerms of Use: https://termsfeed.com/terms-use/c5bcd4de47ffe3020e8aebd04a91af68\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/8042948/full-legal"

      "label": "Watch any web-video, online movie, livestream or live tv show on your Samsung Smart TV or Blu-ray Player. Enjoy the show on your big screen with the no#1 web video streamer.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast for Samsung Smart TV you can browse the web and stream any web video, online movie, livestream or live tv show you want on your Samsung Smart TV. Mp4, m3u8, hls livestreams and also video-over-https are supported.\n \nThere is no time limit at all! You can watch videos of 2 minutes or 2 hours or even more. Just open Video & TV Cast, navigate to a website, wait for link detection and send the video with a single tap to your Samsung Smart TV. The discovered link will be shown below the browser. A tap on the link will start the show. You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the Samsung App Store (Smart Hub) on your TV or Blu-ray Player, search for 'TV Cast' and install the receiver app.\n\n* Please enter the ip-adress of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your Samsung TV Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and other DRM protected videos like HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please use the Remote Playbar for video control while browsing (see more info below)\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all Samsung Smart TVs and Blu-ray Players. You can also use the included TV Remote for basic video control (play, pause, stop, forward and rewind videos) and navigating in Samsung Smart Hub. The TV Remote currently works on 2010 - 2013 TVs.\n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Samsung or any other trademark mentioned here."

      "label": "«ABSTRACTION IS REAL» (J. Albers, 1966)\nGeometriCam uses the iPhone camera as a live video source to generate stylish geometric compositions in real-time.\nExplore your surroundings through the eyes of geometry and be amazed by shapes and colors that change as you move around: creating abstract masterpieces has never been so fun and easy!\n\n«The fizzing real-time patterns on GeometriCam are reminiscent of those closed-eye hallucinations you get with eyes shut in a darkened room or staring with lids closed at bright lights.» (Kevin Holmes - The Creators Project/VICE)\n\n«Whether you use it for an eye-catching selfie or something more unusual, do it soon because GeometriCam offers a look that could well catch on quickly.» (Martin Bryant - The Next Web)\n\nWith GeometriCam you can:\n- capture beautifully crisp images and video clips while controlling a powerful GPU-accelerated filtering engine;\n- import and process images and video clips straight from your photo albums and export professional-quality content;\n- take total control of different stages of non-linear, non-destructive granular editing through innovative and intuitive tools.\n\nLAYOUT\nBehind the scenes your composition is a grid: use your fingers to change the size and aspect ratio of the cells or benefit from smart tools specifically created to help you adjust, refine and frame the layout. See complex patterns come true in seconds thanks to a special UI designed to offer a streamlined, one-handed experience.\n\nSHAPES\nEnjoy a large variety of shapes to choose from (triangles, squares, diamonds, circles and lines) and see your design moving in a few taps from swiss concrete art to tetris-like scenes, from classic polka dots to pop illustrations. Specify the properties of the pattern units underlying the composition by means of innovative custom controls and experiment with shapes like never before!\n\nCOLORS\nDefine the color palette of your artwork and lose yourself in the interplay of shapes and colors. Generate standard or monochromatic color filters with a single tap or precisely adjust Red, Green and Blue channels. Modulate the intensity of the filter in order to find the dress that perfectly suits the character of your composition.\n\nTUNING\nFine-tune the appearance or simply add a finishing touch to your masterpiece. Reduce the color depth to redefine the style of your design (ideal for retro-game or glitchy looks) or apply standard adjustments such as exposure, brightness, contrast, saturation, vibrance and fade.\n\nPRESETS\nUse carefully crafted presets, shipping with the app to get you started, or create your own so you can save and recall your best achievements. Remix and merge existing presets by simply choosing one of the countless combinations of their elemental properties (shapes, colors and tuning): more presets is more fun - just roll the dice and enjoy the surprise!\n\nVORTEX\nHave fun transforming your creations into sparkling circular compositions with this mesmerizing effect. Easily zoom in/out or adjust direction, rotation, swirl and joint angle, all in real-time, all using just your fingers.\n\nPOLYGON (new in v1.2)\nGive your creations a dose of magic and get even more kaleidoscopic results with this powerful new effect. Use your fingers to adjust rotation, sampling (the repeating section), slicing (the number of sides) or just zoom in/out. Jump into a world of ever-changing dreamscapes and you’ll never want to go back!\n\n—\n\nHighlights:\n\n- For images and video clips\n- Real-time preview and processing\n- High quality output (for printing and further video editing)\n- Large variety of scalable, stretchable shapes\n- Wide range of styles, from subtle graphics to abstract scenes\n- Lots of presets to get started\n- Fun and easy, encourages experimentation\n- Designed to offer a smooth, one-handed experience\n\n—\n\nQuestions?

Once the images are loaded and you altered to settings to match your preferenes, tap on the Slideshow button and watch it run automatically. To add a new slide, tap on the Add Slide button at the bottom of the screen and then add images to it. You can edit the slides order by going into the Edit mode (top left button)\n- to add background music to the Slideshow, from the side menu, tap the Pick Song button and load a song from your device's library. Next time you press the Slideshow button, the song will play.\n- to hide the top and bottom control bars in 2 Image Compare/Slideshow mode, tap on the eye icon in the top right corner.

Lightspeed gives you complete control over the shutter speed and capture frame rate, enabling you to make the most creative in-camera videos and photo's imaginable.\n\nDesigned and written by an Academy Award winning visual effects artist, Lightspeed is her take on making the perfect creative camera app.   A clean, user friendly interface with advanced manual controls for discerning creative individuals.\n\n● Continuously variable capture frame rate while recording.\n● Pause recording, or ramp between time-lapse capture to real time motion to stop motion in the same recording.\n● Photos and Movies are saved directly to your camera roll.\n● Watch each frame develop in real time.\n● Superior low light shooting performance.\n● Switch between Front and Back-facing cameras while recording.\n● Control of the amount of motion blur in your time lapse by adjusting the shutter angle to create light trails and silky smooth motion.\n● Use super long exposures to virtually erase fast moving objects while still capturing the motion of shadows and other slower moving objects.\n● Continuously adjust shooting parameters while recording to create fun effects and happy accidents. \n● Film from a moving vehicle and capture a hyper-lapse of your travels. \n● Film personal projects and watch them unfold at warp speed.\n● Use Lightspeed on a second device for hands free control of the app wirelessly.\n● Use the built-in time-lapse calculator to determine how long it will take to film an event, and the duration of the final movie.\n● Set Auto Start and Stop timers to capture events automatically.\n● Lightspeed is capable of continuously filming for days at a time when connected to an external power source.\n\nLightspeed works by accumulating light in a manner similar to a motion picture film camera, where the shutter angle is adjusted to control how long each frame is exposed for in proportion to the capture frame rate. A 180° shutter is the typical setting used for motion pictures, and will give a natural cinematic look to your time-lapse movies no matter how fast or slow you choose to capture frames. Dial the shutter down to 1° degree to minimize motion blur for a traditional staccato feel, or ramp it all the way up to 360° degrees to create light trails and motion blur and give your videos a smooth, fluid look to them."

      "label": "ReeXpose is the best app for long exposure photography on the App Store. Designed by professionals for professionals, ReeXpose closes the gap between your iPhone and a DSLR camera, allowing you to shoot long exposure photos in RAW. All without the need for additional ND filters!\n\nSelect your capture mode, adjust your exposure, chose your capture duration and ReeXpose will do the rest. The result will be a single, 12bit DNG file editable in your favorite editing software.\n\nUse the “motion blur” mode to make people disappear, smooth the movement of clouds or give running water a characteristic silky appearance. Use the “light trails mode” for stunning star trails or to transform moving cars into gorgeous rivers of light. Enjoy the flexibility of full manual controls and the extended dynamic range given by RAW files.\n\nReeXpose is brought to you by Reeflex, the small studio behind the development of Reeflex Pro Camera. \n\n --- MAIN FEATURES ---\n\n- RAW capabilities* for long exposure\n- Extended capture time, from 1s to Bulb**\n- Full manual controls for ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance\n- Motion blur & Light trails mode \n- Exposure guides like histogram and zebra stripes \n- Focus peaking\n- Apple Watch integration for remote shutter\n- Photo backup in the File app\n- Gyroscopic tiltmeter and Grid (rule of thirds)\n- GPS location in the photo’s metadata\n- Language support: English, Spanish, German, French, Italian\n- Blazing fast processing & saving time (1ms)\n- Lock Screen Widget for quick access\n\n--- PRO FEATURES (available through in-App purchase) ---\n\n- Interims results: allows to capture intermediate photos during a long capture\n- Parallel Bracketing: allows to capture 2 photos at different selected exposures for HDR bracketing in post-production\n\n--- ACCESSIBILITY ---\n\n- Color-blind users can now tune the app to best suit their needs, customizing the UI and color coding.\n\n--- CREDITS ---\n\nA big thanks to all our beta testers and collaborators, especially Bintang, Darek, Dale, Germain Julian, Yohsuke, Reece, David, and Shayne. Without you, this project would not be possible. \n\n—- REMARKS —-\n\n*The RAW format is not supported for the ultra-wide camera of devices older than the iPhone 12 series\n**As usual for long exposure, you must use a tripod and keep the phone as steady as possible\n\nWe'd love to hear from you and get your feedback. If you have any ideas on new features or improvements, please email us at: support@reeflexstore.com\n\nTo stay up to date and receive regular updates, subscribe to our newsletter (reeflexstore.com/pages/newsletter) or follow us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (@ReeflexCamera)"

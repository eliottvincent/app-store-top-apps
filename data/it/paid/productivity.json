      "label": "e-Connect is a service for systems centralization, management and supervision that combines in a single cloud platform EL.MO intrusion and fire detection, home management systems and e-Vision® video surveillance systems.\ne-Connect makes it possible to control intrusion and fire detection systems status (home, office, holiday houses, etc.), receive notifications, manage systems through graphic maps, enable/disable devices (ex. detectors), display images of video surveillance systems, and manage domotic systems such as irrigation and lighting systems.\nFind out about e-Connect at http://e-connect.elmospa.com\nThe service usage requires the intervention of EL.MO. qualified and authorized security systems installers who are to create a system account, that is, a user profile enabled for the management of compatible EL.MO. intrusion detection control units and/or e-Vision PRO series DVRs/NVRs. Some functions will be available only for accounts set by installers registered to the platform with multi-level structure.\n \nWhat can e-Connect manage?\n- EL.MO. intrusion detection systems  based on Villeggio, PREGIO, HERCOLA, ETR G2, TITANIA, NET and TACÓRA control units.\n- DVRs, NVRs and IP cameras of e-Vision PRO series.\n- Domotic systems associated to EL.MO. units\ne-Connect can also manage several systems through a single account simultaneously: home, office, holiday houses.\n\nWhat can e-Connect do?\nUsing smartphones and tablets it is possible to control systems status, receive notifications (also referred to InstaVision video verification for an immediate video monitoring upon events occurrence), enable/disable intrusion detection devices, display CCTV systems images (live both single and multichannel, and playback) or manage domotic systems. With regard to the chronothermostat, it will be possible to adjust the temperature and control its working mode from a remote site. \n \nInstaVision Video Verification\nInstaVision is a new e-Connect function for video verification that optimizes the synergy between EL.MO. intrusion and fire detection systems and CCTV e-Vision® PRO systems. It allows receiving real time notifications about one of its security systems and verify its condition immediately. When an event occurs (ex. intrusion attempt) InstaVision allows displaying live images, images recorded at the exact time of the event, and images recorded a few seconds before the occurrence of the event directly from e-Connect app. Such function enables to control whether the event is a false alarm or a true intrusion or fire event in which case a prompt intervention will be possible. Images are not recorded to third-party servers, but directly to users DVRs and NVRs so to reduce to zero personal data breach risks and to shorten dramatically system response time.\n \nHow is e-Connect interface?\ne-Connect features a complete but intuitive control panel. Main icons provide a quick view of the system status, while a convenient side menu grants an easy browsing of e-Connect menu pages. Systems interactive graphic maps allow managing devices and retrieve cameras images view.\n \nHow is power combined with security?\ne-Connect features a Cloud Server structure that includes all control units connected to the network. The use of SSL communication protocol combined with certificates issued by international Certification Authority bodies grants an outstanding security level.\n \nEasy setup and P2P \nThe configuration of e-Connect app and its association to security equipment such as control units and NVRs/DVRs is an easy operation also thanks to P2P connection to EL.MO. proprietary server.\n\nFor web browser version, visit http://connect.elmospa.com website.\n\ne-Connect app performs a regular automatic check of the purchase licence validity; in case of errors, please download the most recent version available on Play Store."

You can add notes, tag it, schedule it, and break it down into smaller steps.\n\n• Your Projects\nCreate a Project for any big goal, then add the to-dos to reach it. Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)\n\n\nMORE THINGS TO LOVE\n\nAs you dive deeper, you’ll find Things packed with helpful features.

Every detail is thoughtfully considered, then polished to perfection.\n\n“It’s like the unicorn of productivity tools: deep enough for serious work, surprisingly easy to use, and gorgeous enough to enjoy staring at.”\n—Apple\n\n\nGET THINGS TODAY\n\nWhatever it is you want to accomplish in life, Things can help you get there.

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

      "label": "Calcoliner, the classic desktop calculator revisited, with a lot more! \n\nCore strength of the App is the virtual 'paper tape', realistic and feature rich. \nCalcoliner uses it to display each calculation and comment in a very intuitive and practical manner.\n\nThe roll can be scrolled and expanded at your convenience to allow for a comfortable view of the calculations.\n\nAutomatic saving of data allows for keeping in a permanent way all calculations in progress for further reviewing and completion.\n\nTextual comments can be added to every operation. It comes very handy where you need to manage a number of variable expenses and you don't want to miss anything. An ideal feature for expense reporting! \n\nCalculations can then be selected and sent via email or even printed via AirPrint.\nEvery single figure printed on the roll can be retrieved and sent back to the display to be used again for new calculations.\n\n\nCalcoliner offers two different switchable ‘calculation modes’: \n\nDIRECT MODE: every operation is evaluated as it is entered. \nEXPRESSION MODE: every operation is evaluated according to arithmetic precedence. \n\nIn Direct Mode % and Delta % operations are possible whereas in Expression Mode mathematical notation with parenthesis is fully supported.\n\nThe ability to let group of calculation performed in the two above modes to co-exist in the same ‘paper roll’ is an exclusive feature of Calcoliner.\nOperators use different colors to highlight actual mode in use. \n\nOther features: Memory store and recall; Computation can be processed with truncation of decimal figures and rounding. \n\nLanguage localization available in English, German, Italian, Chinese, Russian and Spanish. \n\nPlease visit dedicated site at calcoliner.tdmspace.com for further info."

      "label": "Perfect OCR gives you both an accurate general purpose OCR app and a quality document scanner. Now you can scan and OCR your letter-size or A4 documents with an accuracy of 90% or more, edit, copy and store the recognized text, and e-mail your documents as PDF files with text, SINGLE page image, or both together!\n\nNOTE: To ensure the advertised results it is important that you follow the OCR TIPS below (or in the app's help). \n\n\"It worked great for me! I translated a whole story in spanish using the espanol language preference and then I copied and pasted it into a translator to get the whole story in English!\"\n\"This app is really very good and I find it to be very accurate!\"\n>> Perfect OCR users.\n\nPerfect OCR scans your documents using advanced image-processing algorithms to eliminate uneven lighting and shadows and improve contrast. The result is the clearest and most readable scans possible from the iPhone's camera. Perfect OCR also offers SureScan, our proprietary scanning mode that delivers sharper images with less jitter or smear. \n\nOur unique \"Email to myself\" feature lets you send documents to a predefined address, or even upload them to an online storage service like Evernote or Box.net, with a single tap. Uploading documents to online services via email is fast, secure, and can be done even if you're temporarily off line. Refer to app help for details.\n\nAll processing happens on your iPhone, and the confidentiality of your data is never compromised. There is also no subscription fee, and no Internet access is needed to scan documents or run OCR.\n\n\nPERFECT OCR FEATURES:\n• Letter-size or A4 page OCR with accuracy of 95% for model 3GS, 98% for iPhone 4, and up to 90% for 3G\n• OCR languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Czech and Ukrainian.\n• Email multipage PDFs with text, SINGLE page image, or both\n• Automatic document edge detection and perspective correction\n• Multipage text recognition with accuracy indicator\n• Text editing and copy-to-clipboard operations\n• Built-in OCR text archive with file sharing via iTunes\n• \"Email to myself\" feature\n• Email text and image files (.TXT + .JPG), or save image to library\n• Searchable PDFs with document images (single page)\n• Preserves simple text formatting\n• Option to auto-remove line breaks\n• SureScan mode for jitter-free scans\n• Simple yet powerful user interface\n• Instant brightness, rotation, and color controls\n• Compact attachments with adjustable size\n\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS FOR OCR:\n• Make sure your document is flat and well lit. Hold your iPhone still while shooting. \n• Always scan documents using \"SureScan 3x\" mode.\n• Glossy paper may not work well (avoid glare).\n• When scanning books keep the pages as flat as possible and your iPhone parallel to the surface.\n• Perfect OCR cannot recognize handwritten, very large text or spreadsheets correctly.\n• Make sure to select the right language for OCR in app settings.\n\n\nWe're constantly improving Perfect OCR, and we value our customers' opinions and feedback. Please contact us at support@turboscanapp.com. If you have a problem with our software, please contact us before submitting a comment to the app store. We can solve most of the problems, but we cannot respond to comments."

      "label": "miCal is THE calendar that you’ve always wished your iPhone or iPad had! miCal makes scheduling easier, clearer—and better looking—than ever before.\n\nQuick Overview\nThe dashboard displays your current appointments and events, tasks and birthdays. You can also see the current weather and an overview of the current month at a glance.\n\nIntuitive Controls \nIntuitively navigate through your calendars and quickly, easily add events and tasks thanks to predefined settings and simple controls. Standard settings like repeating events and reminders/alarms are just a tap away. And powerful special settings are also available, without sacrificing comfort or control. Swipe through views and open events or days with just a tap.\n\nmiCal Understands You\nQuickly create events with the new natural language input feature. Natural language input allows you to create events just by describing them. And if you have Siri enabled on your device, you can even dictate your event details instead of typing.\n\nThe Total Package\nmiCal provides complete, well-organized day, week and month views and displays the calendar week in all the important views.\n\nRelax\nYou don’t need to contort yourself with miCal. miCal supports portrait as well as landscape formats in nearly every view.  Use each view however it’s most comfortable for you.\n\nTasks/Reminders\nmiCal now supports iOS reminders. Create reminders for all the important tasks in your private and professional life right in the app.\n\nBirthday Manager\nNever again miss an important birthday. Get reminders at preset times featuring the music of your choice.\n\nNice Weather\nFive-day weather forecasts plus the sunrise/sunset times, humidity and wind speed for the current day. The dashboard even features a quick summary of the current weather as well as a brief forecast of the coming days.\n\nComprehensive\nmiCal offers a unique range of features. Copy, move or send your events. Export your events in the date range of your choice as CSV (for Excel, etc.) or ICS (the calendar format). Set colors for your calendars and individual appointments or automatically add colors based on keywords in event titles.\n\nUp to Date and Secure\nmiCal communicates with your device’s integrated calendar. miCal works with  all the calendar services that your device currently supports (iCloud, Google Calendar, Outlook, Exchange, Facebook Events, subscriptions) without requiring additional configuration. That way, you can store your data locally or via the services you know and trust—it’s up to you. miCal itself does not transmit any data to external services or other servers. That allows us to ensure 100% data security.\n\nAward-Winning\n- 3rd place in the \"Best German iPhone App\" competition at the 2010 iPhone Developer conference.\n- Featured as App of the Week in 13 countries.\n- Recommendation from iPhoneWelt and a 5-star rating from iPhone&Co, two of the leading iPhone magazines\n- Honored at the 2010 App Developer Conference"

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "This app provides, using temperature, altitude, humidity, atmospheric pressure and oil-mix ratio, a recommendation about the jetting configuration to use for KTM 2-strokes MX and enduro bikes (SX, SXS, EXC, XC and MXC models).\n\nIn order to get the weather values, the application can use the location service (GPS or WiFi) to obtain the position and altitude, and the network connection to get the temperature, pressure and humidity from the nearest weather station. Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle type and clip position, pilot jet and air screw position are shown (screw position is expressed in turns from fully tightened). These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration introduced in the next tabs. Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. The air density and density altitude are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine (you know that each engine has its own personality). \n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the model year, model and carburetor, and the oil mix ratio that you\\'re using.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures.\n\nValid for the following models from 2005 to 2021:\n- 50 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 50 SX Factory Edition: 2021.\n- 50 SX Mini: 2017-2021.\n- 65 SX: 2017-2021.\n- 85 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 105 SX: 2006-2012.\n- 125 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 125 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 125 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 125 XC: 2017-2018.\n- 144 SX: 2007-2008.\n- 150 SX: 2009-2021.\n- 150 XC: 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019.\n- 200 EXC: 2005-2016.\n- 200 XC: 2005-2012.\n- 250 SX: 2005-2021.\n- 250 SXS: 2005-2007.\n- 250 XC: 2007-2019.\n- 250 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 EXC: 2005-2018.\n- 300 XC: 2009-2018.\n- 300 MXC: 2005.\n* Please note that the application is valid only for engines that use carburetor.

The Guide is built up in an eclectic way, inspired by different teachers and schools. Access to different levels of information will provide challenges and inspiration to beginners as well as teachers. The Aikido Guide contains: \n• Techniques applied from 12 different attacks\n• 19 in-depth explanations of core techniques\n• 4 modes: Basic, advanced and two flowing modes \n• 344 videos of different combinations of attack, technique and mode \n• 568 different applications including Omote and Ura. Each application is shown from two or three angles \n• 14 videos explaining important Taisabaki – Way of entering, linked to each attack-technique combination \n• 18 videos with basic movements for individual practice\n• 4 videos with explanation of important principles of Aikido, such as the Triangle, the Circle and the Square\n• 3 video interviews \n\nUPGRADING OF THE VIDEOS: In June 2014, 38 videos were retaken and published. Among these were the explanations of the four modes, as well as the in-depth explanation of Kotegaeshi and several of the flowing techniques from Yokomen uchi and Shomen uchi. In this way the Aikido Guide is improved without the need of making new versions of the application itself.\n\nBJORN EIRIK OLSEN received his 6th Dan in 2004 and was promoted to Shihan by Aikikai Hombu Dojo in January 2012. He has been living in Japan for many years were he practiced intensively with teachers such as Morito Suganuma Sensei, Minoru Inaba Sensei and late Morihiro Saito Sensei – in addition to late Doshu Kishomaru Ueshiba, the present Doshu Moriteru Ueshiba and several of the old students of Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido. Presently he is the Chief instructor of the Norwegian Aikido Federation, and he has also been teaching in, among others, England, Greece and Vietnam. \n\nFor the best experience, this application requires WIFI.\n\nIMPORTANT: Audio/Video descriptions are in English only.\n\nREVIEWS: The Aikido Guide App has received very good reviews and scores from its users in 70 different countries, but they may not be visible on Apple Store in your country. Some examples:   \n\n\"Eine tolle App, führ mich momentan die beste Aikido-App. Sehr striukturiert und vor allem sehr viele Angriffs-Technik-Kombinationen. Zumindest führ einen Anfänger wie mich extrem hilfreich, da die Techniken detailliert gezeight und auch erklärt werden.\"\nBy x10001 from Switzerland about Aikido Guide (version 1.5, Apple App Store) on Nov 21, 2013.\n\n\"It's perfect for a beginner like me and i believe it will be very useful to the seasoned practitioners. It has clear explanation and clear illustration of each technique. Having it is just like having an Aikido instructor with you anytime you want. Thanks!\"\nBy likuankoh from Singapore about AikidoGuide (version 1.3, Apple App Store) on Dec 30, 2012.\n\n“Each technique from basic to advanced in 4 different steps of difficulty as a HQ-movie with comments and descriptions. I've never seen such a great guide before!\"\nBy takethetick from Germany about AikidoGuide (version 1.2, Apple App Store) on Jul 20, 2012.\n\n\"Sensei in your pocket - I have tried other aikido apps and they don't come close to the quality, content, and presentation of this one. Arigato gozaimashita.\"\nBy Chris in Virginia from United States about AikidoGuide (version 1.2, Apple App Store) on Jun 15, 2012.\n\n\"This is the first useful aikido guide I've seen. It is comprehensive and clear. A great guide to all basic techniques with the advanced versions just a click away. I wish I had this tool when I took my kyu-grades.\"\nBy Feerth from Norway about AikidoGuide (version 1.0, Apple App Store) on May 11, 2012.\n\nFor more information on reviews, please see http://www.aikidoguide.no/reviews.html.\n\n\nAIKIDO is a Japanese Martial Art that aims at solving situations in a harmonious way by understanding and expressing universal laws of body, mind and spirit."

      "label": "Listen to your racquet and perfect your game!\n\nRacquetTune ensures that your racquet is ideally suited to your style of play. Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

Internal barometer is used on supported devices for better precision. Application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet, in this case user has to enter weather data manually.\n\n• 12 different carburetor configs!\n• For each jetting setup, the following values are given: main jet, emulsion tube, needle type and position (including intermediate positions with washer), throttle valve, idle jet (outer pilot jet), idle emulsifier (inner pilot jet), air screw position\n• Fine tuning for all these values\n• You can create your carburetor and check the performance (over 90 needles available)\n• History of all your jetting setups\n• Graphic display of fuel mix quality (Air/Flow Ratio or Lambda)\n• Support two idle emulsion tube types (DP or DQ)\n• Selectable throttle valve Size\n• Selectable fuel type (gasoline with or without ethanol, Racing fuels available, for example: VP C12, VP 110, VP MRX02)\n• Adjustable fuel/oil ratio\n• large selection of floats\n• Adjustable floats height\n• Mix wizard to get the perfect mix ratio (fuel calculator)\n• Carburetor ice warning\n• Possibility of use automatic weather data or a portable weather station.\n• let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, liters, ml, gallons, oz for fuel, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg atm for pressures.\n\nThe application contains five tabs, which are described next:\n\n• Results: In this tab, 12 different jetting setups are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine and track configuration given in the next tabs. For each jetting setup, the following values are given: main jet, emulsion tube, needle type and needle position, idle emulsifier (inner pilot jet) and idle jet (outer pilot jet), throttle valve, air screw position.\n  This tab lets do a fine tuning adjustment for all this values for each jetting setup to adapt to the concrete engine.\n  Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude, relative air density, SAE - dyno correction factor, station pressure, SAE - relative horsepower, oxygen pressure and volumetric content of oxygen are shown too.\n  You can also see in a graphic form the calculated ratio of air and fuel (lambda).\n\n• History: This tab contains the history of all jetting setups.\n\n• Compare: On this tab, you can compare two carburetors. To do this, you need to set all the components of the carburetor. The result will be shown in the form of graphs of the ratio of air and fuel (or lambda).\n\n• Engine: You can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, engine model (K9, K9B, K9C, KZ10, KZ10B, KZ10C, KZ-R1), carburetor diameter, emulsion tube type, float type and height, fuel type, oil mix ratio and type of the circuit. Depending of this parameters, the jetting setups will be adapted.\n\n• Weather: In this tab, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. \n  Also this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service (you can choose one weather data source from several possible) to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station.\n  In addition, this application can work with a pressure sensor built into the iPhone. You can see if it is available on your device and turn it on or off.\n\n\nIf you have any doubt about using this App, please, contact us. We answer every question, and we take care of all comments from our users to try to improve our software."

It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "▸ GOLF & COUNTRY wrote: “Highly-accurate data. Clever.”\n▸ EXTRA GOLF wrote: “The undisputed no. 1 golf app.”\n▸ GOLF JOURNAL wrote: “A real must for golfers who own an iPhone.”\n▸ GOLFERS ONLY wrote: “The perfect virtual caddie. Recommendation: Buy.”\n\nOn the basis of state-of-the-art GPS technology, the GPS Caddie from Expert Golf sends the exact distance to the green directly to your display – with an accuracy of 1-3 meters. You can also measure the length of your shots (e.g. drives). The distances are permanently available to be read off the display, without any user interaction (no aiming necessary and you do not have to be able to see the flag). This is facilitated by a vast database containing the GPS coordinates of the golf courses.\nThe accuracy of the data is of utmost importance to Expert Golf. Therefore highly-accurate data is collected in cooperation with the national surveying and topography offices and other government agencies – as opposed to most other providers whose apps are based on free aerial imagery and who thus tolerate discrepancies of tens of meters. \nThe database is updated and extended daily. An overview of the courses already mapped is available at courses.expertgolf.com. \n\nWhy Expert Golf is better\n▸ User-friendly and intuitive operation (a manual is superfluous).\n▸ More precise distance information thanks to mapping by professional surveyors.\n▸ Virtually no roaming charges (no need to download aerial photos).\n▸ No network coverage required (the app only uses the free GPS signal).\n▸ No advertising pop-ups.\n▸ Database updated daily.\n▸ Support 365 days a year.\n▸ Excellent customer ratings and top rankings in the App Store.\n▸ Leading app for many years and improved with regular updates.\n\n100% RULES COMPLIANT! The use of iPhones as distance measuring devices has been permitted in tournaments since 1.1.2014, on the condition that distance measuring devices are allowed in the Local Rules. (Please note: Many GPS apps give advice on club selection and are therefore banned. However “Expert Golf” complies with the rules as per the R&A.)\n\nIncluding updates for one year. (Note: Expert Golf is NOT a subscription. The annual fee will not automatically be charged again after the year has ended. You can continue to use the app without renewing the service, you will just no longer be able to download any new courses from the database.)\n\nFAQ – Why Expert Golf charges an annual fee\nEach year approximately 15% of golf courses are redesigned or newly built or the order of their holes is changed etc. This means that the database has to be constantly maintained and updated. Only with an annual fee concept will you be guaranteed access to up-to-date and comprehensive data that you can trust on a long-term basis. Providers that only charge a once-only payment for their app will sooner or later stop maintaining their data.\n\nExpert Golf is the only app that puts everything a player needs during a round of golf onto the iPhone. It comprises a total of four modules including “iGolfrules” – one of the world’s most popular sport apps that has been in the App Store top ten continually for many years and is officially recommended by Apple. You can add the following additional modules to your app (charges apply)\n▸ Score card & Stableford calculator\n▸ Golf rules\n▸ Golf tips\n\nIf you are happy with our app we would be grateful if you would take a moment of your time to post a rating/ write a review in the App Store.\nIf, for whatever reason, you are not happy with the app or have any questions about it please contact our support team at support@expertgolf.com."

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

The app also calculates your Stableford points fully-automatically. This is facilitated by a vast database containing the score card information and the ratings of the golf courses (unlike other apps with which the users have to create the score cards themselves). \nThe database is updated and extended daily. An overview of the current list of courses can be found at courses.expertgolf.com. \n\nWhy Expert Golf is better\n▸ User-friendly and intuitive operation (a manual is superfluous).\n▸ The first score card in the world that can be signed on the touchscreen.\n▸ More precise data thanks to professional mapping.\n▸ Database updated daily.\n▸ Support 365 days a year.\n▸ No advertising pop-ups at all.\n▸ Excellent customer ratings and top rankings in the App Store.\n▸ Leading app for many years and improved with regular updates.\n\nIncluding updates for one year. (Note: Expert Golf is NOT a subscription. The annual fee will not automatically be charged again after the year has ended. You can continue to use the app without renewing the service, you will just no longer be able to download any new courses from the database.)\n\nFAQ – Why Expert Golf charges an annual fee\nEach year approximately 15% of golf courses are redesigned or newly built or the order of their holes is changed etc. This means that the database has to be constantly maintained and updated. Only with an annual fee concept will you be guaranteed access to up-to-date and comprehensive data that you can trust on a long-term basis. Providers that only charge a once-only payment for their app will sooner or later stop maintaining their data.\n\nExpert Golf is the only app that puts everything a player needs on a round of golf onto the iPhone. It comprises a total of four modules including “iGolfrules” – one of the world’s most popular sport apps that has been in the App Store top ten continually for many years and is officially recommended by Apple. You can add the following additional modules to your app (charges apply)\n▸ GPS caddie \n▸ Golf rules\n▸ Golf tips\n\nIf you are happy with our app we would be grateful if you would take a moment of your time to post a rating/ write a review in the App Store.\nIf, for whatever reason, you are not happy with the app or have any questions about it please contact our support team at support@expertgolf.com."

It doesn’t require any connection to your car. Results are provided as detailed reports featuring interactive charts.\n\nHow does PerfExpert dyno works ? It's simple :\n1. Create your car profile => Describe your car to PerfExpert by providing information such as curb weight, tire sizes or engine displacement. If you don't know how to find your car's specifications, we help you to do so.\n2. Mount your phone in your car => No need to connect your phone to your car. With your phone firmly mounted inside your car, PerfExpert can rely on its internal sensors to measure the real acceleration of your car.\n3. Accelerate through the entire engine rev range => On a flat, straight and horizontal road, perform an acceleration from low rev to the maximum rev, keeping the same gear : that's it!\n\nIMPORTANT : dyno test is not compatible with automatic gearboxes that doesn't have a manual mode.\n\nWith such a tool, you can check the efficiency of your various tunings, ECU mapping, chiptuning, and even your chassis settings.\n\nUsing the specification of the tested car and your device’s accelerometer, the application runs our algorithms and dynamic power loss calculations to provide the performances of your car with high accuracy.\n\nSkeptical? Here is a selection of comparison tests between “PerfExpert - Car Onboard Dyno” and real chassis dynos, performed by some of our users : http://bit.ly/perfexpert_vs_chassis_dyno\n\nFor further information, you can find our FAQ at https://www.perfexpert-app.com/faq\n\nHere are sample dyno and timed run reports created using the application :\nhttps://network.perfexpert-app.com/results/featured\n\nJoin now the growing PerfExpert community:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PerfExpert\n- Support : https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfexpert/\n\nFeatures:\n- Dyno test : measure the power and torque of your engine with advanced loss calculation model. Detection of the engine rev limiter. Detailed reports featuring interactive charts of wheel and engine horsepower and torque / engine speed, just like a regular chassis dynamometer.\n\n- Compute corrected power and torque using the correction norm of your choice (atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature and air humidity are taken into account). Available standards: DIN (Europe), SAE (America), JIS (Japan), CEE (Europe) and ISO (International).\n\n- Timed Run test to measure your 0-60mph, 0-60ft, 0-1/8mi, 0-1/4mi, 0-100km/h, 0-20m, 0-200m, 0-400m,  and much more.\n\n- Use of your phone accelerometer at its maximum frequency and advanced signal processing for smoothed curves.\n\n- Custom choice of units from a large choice: Hp, Ch, Cv, Kw, Nm, Ft.Lb, mKg, Mph, Km/h, m, ft, G, m/s², psi, inHg, mBar, °C, °F\n\n- Export reports in Tab Separated Value format and PNG"

      "label": "Harry's LapTimer is the advanced tool for car enthusiast. It records all types of sensor data provided by your iPhone/iPod/iPad (or external sensors), combines them, and makes them available to optimize your drive. Over time, you will get insights on your car and in your driving, not known before.\n\nLapTimer offers more than 1300 predefined tracks world wide. With its assistants, it is extremely easy to setup - just click your track and drive. It fully automates your lap timing using GPS, and presents the results to all kinds of media.\n\nYou are not limited to track driving only. For example, you may define your home and working locations as a 'track', collect statistics on different ways chosen, and analyze / optimize the time used every day. \n\nWant to show your drive to your friends? LapTimer Petrolhead and above generates beautiful in car video recordings with all kinds of data overlaid, ready to be presented - e.g. on youtube. Even without video, recorded data can be analyzed using purpose designed views, making it easy to analyze and improve your driving performance.\n\nUsing online racing, you can use LapTimer in competition. LapTimer offers a Hall of Fame, allows watching you and your friends on track - all in real time. Compare your sector times, braking / acceleration points, and learn from each other. \n\nYou can start with your plain iPhone in the beginning and add external GPS and OBD II sensors later, step by step, and as you need it. LapTimer itself comes in three different editions: LapTimer Rookie is the entry level with all you need for lap timing; LapTimer Petrolhead is the advanced version including lots of video features, and LapTimer Grand Prix is the edition for professionals including Multi Cam recording, Health Kit integration, and advanced sensor and analytics functionality. \n\nPlease note that functionality depends on your device, the LapTimer edition chosen, and sometimes even external sensors added (like OBD II). Please visit our web page to get the full story. All edition can be upgraded later, all editions come with native iPhone and iPad support. \n\nThere are quite expensive stand alone solutions for track days available. Be smart and own the leading edge tool simply by using your iPhone and LapTimer. Besides the professional area, there is no known solution that offers more functionality than LapTimer does - across the market. As our ambition is to offer the best tool, LapTimer is enhanced continuously.\n\nPlease visit http://www.gps-laptimer.de for detailed information on versions, FAQs / documentation, in depth technology background information, online racing, and supported device configurations.

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

      "label": "The 'YO YO Endurance Test' provides an important instrument for determining the level of physical efficiency of an athlete.\nThe physical capacity is evaluated quickly and easily by placing two cones spaced 20 meters each other.\nThe athlete has to run at full speed from one cone to another and then return again on the first cone. This path must be repeated for six times without any break, and get  the split times every time the athlete passes on the first cone.\n\nThis application will track all the split time and at the end will be calculated two parameters that determine the outcome of the test. More these values are low and better will be the athlete's performance.\n\nBasically the final result is given by a mathematical formula that processes the delta between the averages of the last two split times and the first two split times  and thereby the athlete's ability to maintain its maximum speed for a certain period of time.\n\nThe second value obtained on completion of the test, is the first result considering also the total time of the test.\n\nThe 'YO YO Endurance Test' can be used to determine the level of athletic in all sports (football, running, basketball, volleyball, cycling, tennis etc.)\nAt the end of the test you can get for each athlete the final result (eg. \"Above average\" or \"Poor\") and the Vo2Max estimate\n\nYou can manage more Athletes and save personal data and notes.\nYou can analyze test results.\nAutomatic Sync between devices thanks to iCloud\nInfo section where you can better understand how prepare the test and you can visit linked website and video where get more info about YO-YO Endurance Test\n\nIf you find this application useful, please give a positive review in the AppStore, so we can further improve and develop new options.\n\nFor any further information, please send an email to:\nsupport@bitandweb.com\n\nThanks"

But there are products out there, where you can put your iDevice into, to make it waterproof and still be able to operate it. In this way you can either mount it near your other instruments on your keelboat or strap it to your arm if you are sailing a dinghy.\n\nFeatures:\n\nMain View.\nHere you can see your 4 most important readouts, fore instance Heading, Speed, VMG and Performance.\n\nThere also is a lift indicator, showing you if you have been lifted by a wind shift, and graphs showing the development in your speed and VMG over a configurable amount of time and a permormance bar.\n\nWind direction.\nSet your wind direction by storing your heading while sailing on upwind on starboard and port tack, or simply type it in.\n\nStart view.\nHere you have your count down (including sync), and you can mark your starting line and iRegatta will calculate the distance to the line and indicate the favorite line end, if wind direction is set.\n\nStatistics view.\nView your current position and trip odometer and max speed since last reset. You'll also see a polar diagram with your speed and VMG (wind speed dependent).\n\nWaypoints.\nNavigate to your favorite pre-stored waypoints, or create a new temporary waypoint by cross bearing using the iPhone internal camera, or by distance/bearing.\n\nTracking.\nRecord your track and view it on the map or export it for further analysis to your computer.\n\nInstead of internal GPS you can get instrument information over WiFi from NMEA0183 instruments. \n\nAIS data received over WiFi will be displayed in a Radar-like view.\n\niRegatta also comes with a watch app, which will allow you to view data on your watch as well as operate the start line features. Besides that, the watch app will track your sailing as an activity and help you close your activity circles using HealthKit..\n\nRead more detailed information on the apps web page."

Even if your are flying accidentally within a cloud or under poor visibility conditions!\n\nBy typing to „Alt 3“ - usually after the adjusting phase - or any time later you can reset „Alt 3“ to „0“.\n\nMoreover you can use the App to\n\n    - record you flights \n    - view your recorded flights in the integrated map view  \n    - send your recorded flights by mail as kml-files or gpx -files to your friends \n    \nOne last note: \nThe app reacts a little somewhat slower, as e.g. a Bräuninger- or Flytec Vario, if you use the internal pressure sensor of the iPhone, because the sensor doesn't provide data as often as an external sensor. \n\nThe app requires a good GPS signal, if no internal or external pressure sensor can be used. \n\nPlease make sure in any case, that you have a good GPS signal,  if you use the app. \nThe app does NOT work - completely and reliably - in buildings or other situations in which you have no or a bad GPS signal! \nHowever, this should not be a problem, since you usually flying under a clear open sky. ;-) \n\nUsage - without - an internal or external sensor is possible, but subject to known the limitations of a pure GPS operation, such as using only open-air, a good GPS signal and altitude changes > 5m with at least 1-2 m/s. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\nEven if the App is running in background, the GPS location service is used by the App, if you record your flight!"

Scientifically validated (publication in review in a high-impact journal). \nThe only app that accurately calculates the complete power-force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino et al.´s method (published in 2015). \n\nMy Sprint is the first app scientifically developed to measure the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes. Innovative design, validated by sports scientists, My Sprint is as reliable as a 4000$ radar plus PC system. Scientifically approved!\n\nSprint running, power output and forward acceleration are a key combination of performance in many sports activities. Determining individual Force–Velocity profile, maximal power and mechanical effectiveness during sprint propulsion is of great interest for coaches, sport practitioners, or physiotherapists. What makes you fast?\n\nTheir opinion about My Sprint:\n\n- Dr. Samozino: “One of our main interests is to make accessible to sport practitioners the scientific evaluations we do in our labs with very specific devices. The simple method on which My Sprint is based was developed in this sense to test the sprint mechanical capabilities in field condition. The results of the validation of the method in comparison to force plate measurements were better than those we expected! And the validity of the data obtained with My Sprint is in the same extent… but with an impressive simplicity!”  \n\n- Pr. Morin: “When we developed our 2015 simple method, we found it was a great achievement to measure sprint acceleration mechanics with a very high concurrent validity compared to the gold standard force plate measurements. My Sprint takes things to another level, since it allows accurate measurements with just an iPhone!”\n\nMy Sprint calculates Power-Force-Velocity profile and measures the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. It was specially designed to take advantage of the extraordinary 120-240fps camera of the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. You just need to perform an all-out 40 m sprint and mark the track with a reference system marks located at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 meters and you only need six visible vertical markers (like thin poles) at these markers to record the time between markers. After that My Sprint does the computations and calculates athlete´s mechanical capabilities.  \n\nFEATURES: \n\n- Accurate measurement of the split times over a sprint acceleration. Scientifically validated!\n- Calculation the Power-Force-Velocity profile using the innovative Samozino et al.´s method. You can therefore know the athlete’s mechanical capabilities that determine the entire sprint acceleration performance. These properties are integrative and encompass all the mechanisms involved in the total external force produced during each lower limb extension and the ability to orient it effectively onto the ground. \n- Record amazing slow motion videos up to 240fps (iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s) and analyse in a frame-by-frame mode as well as import videos from your camera roll. \n- Multi-user. You can create as many users as your need with My Sprint. You can assign each user to a team for a higher ease of use. \n- Performance follow-up. You can record as many sprints as you want for each user created and analyze performance through a competitive season. \n\nNote: My Sprint was scientifically validated using an iPhone 6, and it uses the slow motion video recording on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. On other devices, the measurements are less accurate slow motion video recording feature is not available. \n\nA SPRINT ACCELERATION MECHANICS LAB IN YOUR POCKET!"

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, four different jetting setups are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine and track configuration given in the next tabs. For each jetting setup, the following values are given: main jet, emulsion tube, needle type and clip position, inner pilot jet (iddle diffuser) and outer pilot jet (iddle jet). Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude and relative horsepower are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tunning adjustment for the main (high), needle (mid) and pilot (low) circuits for each jetting setup to adapt to the concrete engine. \n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can configure in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the engine model (K9, K9B, K9C, KZ10, KZ10B, KZ10C, KZ-R1), the float type and height, the oil mix ratio and the type of the circuit (spring or road racing, short or long). Depending of the track type, the jetting setups will be adapted.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures."

Those predictions and data are designed and prepared by European Sports Analyzers and Computer Engineers.\n* In our applications, you can find the whole leagues’ matches and league table in the same screen and you can easily compare them. \n\n What is the biggest advantages of our application?\n* All data is ready and in one sheet; easy to compare everything. \n* You can compare league by league.\n* You can compare match by match.\n* You can compare according to total match statistics.\n* You can compare according to home/away statistics.\n \n What is our aim?\n* Our aim is not to bilk you by showing you incorrect data.\n* Our aim is not to serve expansive predictions.\n* Our aim is to serve you useful data and the choice up to you. We are leaving the choice to you.\n* Of course, in the future there will be some other fake applications, but do not forget us, we are the first to do this and we will always be best for you.\n \n What is the reason to choose us for you?\n* We are cheaper than others. If you look or search in the internet, you will see that other applications are much more expensive than us.\n* Others show only the matches which they liked. But we are giving all matches to you.\n* Others show only some statistics but we show all statistics to you.\n* Others sends the predictions by email 12-24 hours ago, but you can see all predictions online in our applications.\n\n Which data you will see in our application?\n* League Name\n* Home Team\n* Away Team\n* Home Team Score\n* Away Team Score\n* Home Team Odd\n* Away Team Odd\n* Home Team – Total Matches\n* Away Team – Total Matches\n* Home Team – Home Matches\n* Away Team – Away Matches\n* Total Goal Average, for Over/Under prediction.\n* Prediction for result and percentage of prediction.\n\n If you have any idea, question or need, please feel free to contact with us by using this email address : info@north-software.com \n \n Some additional descriptions:\n\n Some people prefer to bet on some leagues and some others prefer to bet on different leagues. For this reason, even if it reduce our success percentage, we wanted to serve you almost every league. You will decide which league or which team you want to bet on.\n\n For “1” and “2” predictions, we suggest you to use only first leagues. For second and third leagues, it is more common to see that strong teams loose the match or the match ends in draw. We do not restrict those kind of situations in our application because we want to serve you every single match.\n\n For “Over” and “Under” predictions, we suggest you to prepare one table to determine which league is suitable for “Over” or “Under” betting. For example: Greece first league, Greece second league, Portugal second league, Spain second league are not suitable for “Over” predictions. Do not bet on.\n\n We tried to explain how you are going to use this application, we hope that we succeeded. If you are good at logic and mathematics, than you will use this application more effective and successful. You will use this application more effective day by day. You will even create black list for teams and leagues by time pasing.\n\n Good luck !"

      "label": "Blackjack Card Counter is a unique application for the iPhone and iPad.  Beware of imitations this is the original.\n\nIt allows any blackjack player, professional or amateur to keep track of their card count.\n\n** True Count **\n\nBlackjack Card Counter calculates the \"True Count\" for you and does it more accurately than manual methods.  As buttons are pressed in the app the total counted cards are recorded.  This is then adjusted to take into account cards that aren't recorded.  A “total cards dealt” number is determined which is then divided by 52 to represent total decks dealt.  This number is then used in the \"True Count\" calculation.\n\nYou can adjust the number of decks in the shoe by going to the info screen.\n\n** Card Counting Methods **\n\nFor each strategy press the button that contains the face value of the cards as they are drawn from the deck.  Depending on the strategy and on the value of the card the button will either add or subtract 1 or 2 from the \"Running Count\".\n\nHi-Lo  - Low cards 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (add 1 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q, K and A (subtract 1 from total).\n\nHi-Op  I - Low cards 3, 4, 5, and 6 (add 1 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 1 from total).\n\nHi-Op  II - Low cards 2, 3, 6 and 7 (add 1 to total) 4 and 5 (add 2 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 2 from total).\n\nOmega II - Low cards 2 and 3 (add 1 to total) 4, 5 and 6 (add 2 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 2 from total).\n\nAfter a shuffle the new deck button should be pressed to set the tally back to 0.\n\n** Basic Strategy **\n\nAs most blackjack players know if you stick to the Basic Strategy for blackjack the house has a small advantage.  But if you can keep count of the number of High and Low ranked cards in the pack you can gain a small advantage.  You do this by betting more when there are more High cards still in the deck.  \n\nYou have an advantage when more high cards are in the deck particularly near the end of the shoe.\n\nThis small advantage, around 1%, over a long period of time can result in huge wins.\n\nDisclaimer: This app is intended for home use entertainment purposes only. At many casinos it is deemed illegal to use an electronic device with the intention of gaining an advantage over the casino. By choosing accept you agree not to use this app for illegal purposes.

This will avoid problems with bluetooth device discovery. It is known that some apps keep searching for bluetooth devices all the time, preventing other apps like this one from detecting bluetooth devices.\n\nIt will warn you with auditive voice warning even if being in background and/or listening to music. Perfect for working out outdoors!\n\nThis app needs a bluetooth 4.0 low energy (BLE) or bluetooth smart heart rate sensor in order to work. Some of the known working sensors are: \n - Polar H6\n - Polar H7\n - Wahoo tickr\n - Beets BLU\n - Oregon Scientific BLE Fabric Chest Belt\n - Runtastic heart rate combo monitor\n - Mio Link\n - Mio Alpha\n - Geonaute BLE\n - Sigma HRM\n\nSuch sensors are only compatible iPhone 4S or newer, which have bluetooth 4.0.\n\nDisclaimer: do not use this app for medical or critical life purposes."

It records all types of sensor data provided by your iPhone/iPod/iPad (or external sensors), combines them, and makes them available to optimize your drive. Over time, you will get insights on your car and in your driving, not known before.\n\nLapTimer offers more than 1300 predefined tracks world wide. With its assistants, it is extremely easy to setup - just click your track and drive. It fully automates your lap timing using GPS, and presents the results to all kinds of media.\n\nYou are not limited to track driving only. For example, you may define your home and working locations as a 'track', collect statistics on different ways chosen, and analyze / optimize the time used every day. \n\nWant to show your drive to your friends? LapTimer Petrolhead and above generates beautiful in car video recordings with all kinds of data overlaid, ready to be presented - e.g. on youtube. Even without video, recorded data can be analyzed using purpose designed views, making it easy to analyze and improve your driving performance.\n\nUsing online racing, you can use LapTimer in competition. LapTimer offers a Hall of Fame, allows watching you and your friends on track - all in real time. Compare your sector times, braking / acceleration points, and learn from each other. \n\nYou can start with your plain iPhone in the beginning and add external GPS and OBD II sensors later, step by step, and as you need it. LapTimer itself comes in three different editions: LapTimer Rookie is the entry level with all you need for lap timing; LapTimer Petrolhead is the advanced version including lots of video features, and LapTimer Grand Prix is the edition for professionals including Multi Cam recording, Health Kit integration, and advanced sensor and analytics functionality. \n\nPlease note that functionality depends on your device, the LapTimer edition chosen, and sometimes even external sensors added (like OBD II). Please visit our web page to get the full story. All edition can be upgraded later, all editions come with native iPhone and iPad support. \n\nThere are quite expensive stand alone solutions for track days available. Be smart and own the leading edge tool simply by using your iPhone and LapTimer. Besides the professional area, there is no known solution that offers more functionality than LapTimer does - across the market. As our ambition is to offer the best tool, LapTimer is enhanced continuously.\n\nPlease visit http://www.gps-laptimer.de for detailed information on versions, FAQs / documentation, in depth technology background information, online racing, and supported device configurations.

      "label": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year. There is a 2 weeks free trial period.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to SprintTimer Pro, the purchase will be charged to your Apple ID account. The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the period. You can manage it from the user settings in iTunes after purchasing it, and you will also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there.\n\nIf you purchase a new SprintTimer Pro subscription during a free trial you will forfeit any free trial remaining from your first subscription.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy: https://sprinttimer.se/privacy\n\n\nIcon runners made by Freepik from Flaticon.com"

      "label": "This application shows all today's matches. By using intelligent algorithms, it makes predictions about the results. Those predictions are designed and prepared by European Sports Analyzers and Computer Engineers.\n\nAll today's matches are shown in one screen. Matches are grouped by their leagues. Now, you can easily compare them to each other.\n\nIn this application, you can see the below information.\n* country and league name\n* home team and away team name\n* home team and away team odds\n* home team and away team total point\n* The performance of home team (last 5 matches)\n* The performance of away team (last 5 matches)\n* Match start time (if the match is not over yet)\n* Match result (if the match is over)\n* The prediction (1, 2, 1X or 2X)\n* The percentage (the possibility of the prediction)\n\nWhat are the reasons to choose our application?\n* We are cheaper than others. If you search in the internet, you will see that other applications are more expensive than us.\n* We are showing all matches. Others show only some matches.\n* Others are sending the predictions 12-24 hours before the current day, only by email, but we are providing all predictions online in our application.\n\nIf you have any idea or question, please feel free to contact with us.\ninfo@north-software.com\n\nSome additional descriptions:\n\nSome people prefer to bet on some specific leagues but some other people prefer to bet on different leagues. For this reason, even if it is reducing our success percentage, we wanted to show you almost every league. You can decide which league or which team that you want to bet on.\n\nFor “1” and “2” predictions, we suggest you to use only first leagues. For second and third leagues, it is more common to see that strong teams loose the match or the match ends in draw. We do not want to hide some matches in our application because we want to show you every single match.\n\nWe hope you will like this application.\n\nGood luck!"

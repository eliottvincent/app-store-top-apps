You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun.

She's got a hot attitude and won't back down from a fight, she wins every time. If you haven't already guessed it, she's a powerful psycho too.\n\nSo what will happen when their paths cross? Will the King finally find his Queen? Is she just as crazy as him? Or possibly more? Will they make it out of this alive or will it all burn down to ashes? Sit back and relax.

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

      "label": "Bible Darby en français (FRDBY)\nLa Sainte Bible de John Nelson Darby (a l'origine de la doctrine du dispensationalisme) : a partir du grec et de l'hébreu. J.N. Darby a également traduit la Bible en anglais et en allemand. Elle fait partie des Bibles en français dont le texte est actuellement dans le domaine public.\nAncien Testament et du Nouveau Testament\n\nAncien Testament\nDans le christianisme, on appelle Ancien Testament ou Ancienne Alliance1, l'ensemble des écrits de la Bible hébraïque, textes hébreux antérieurs a la vie de Jésus, laquelle est relatée dans le Nouveau Testament (en grec : H Παλαια Διαθηκη / Hê Palaià Diathếkê).\nL'Ancien Testament rassemble des écrits religieux juifs. Pour les chrétiens, la Bible se compose de l'Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament. L'Ancien Testament comprend les parties suivantes : le Pentateuque, les livres historiques, les Hagiographes et les Prophètes2.\nLe mot testament vient du mot grec διαθηκη / diathếkê : testament, contrat, convention) traduit en latin par testamentum (testament ; témoignage). Le mot grec a un sens plus large que le mot latin : celui de contrat ou « alliance ».\nl est difficile de situer le moment a partir duquel l'Ancien Testament est constitué en Canon par les chrétiens. Au IIe siècle, l'Église de Rome décide de rejeter l'hérésie de Marcion, qui prétend supprimer toute référence aux écrits vétéro-testamentaires. Ce n'est que plus tard que le Canon de la Bible chrétienne est constitué.\nLe plan du canon de l'Ancien Testament selon la Septante est le suivant6 :\n- Pentateuque (Torah) : Genèse, Exode, Lévitique, Nombres et Deutéronome\n- Les livres historiques : Josué, Juges, Ruth, I-II Samuel, I-II Rois, I-II Chroniques, Esdras, Néhémie, Esther, Tobit*, Judith*, I-II Maccabées*\n- Les Hagiographes : Job, Psaumes, Proverbes, Ecclésiaste, Cantique des Cantiques, Sagesse de Salomon*, Ecclésiastique*\n- Les Prophètes : Esaïe, Jérémie, Lamentations, Baruch*, Ezéchiel, Daniel, Osée, Joël, Amos, Abdias, Jonas, Michée, Nahum, Habaquq, Sophonie, Aggée, Zacharie, Malachie\nNouveau Testament\nLe Nouveau Testament (en grec : H Καινη Διαθηκη / Hê Kainề Diathếkê), est l’ensemble des écrits relatifs a la vie de Jésus et a l'enseignement de ses premiers disciples qui ont été reconnus comme « canoniques » par les autorités chrétiennes au terme d'un processus de plusieurs siècles.\nLe mot « testament » vient du mot grec διαθηκη (diathếkê : « testament, contrat, convention ») traduit en latin par testamentum (testament, témoignage). Le mot grec a un sens plus large (celui de contrat) que le mot latin. Aussi certains préfèrent-ils le traduire par Alliance.\nLes chrétiens considèrent que la Bible se compose de l’Ancien Testament (écrits antérieurs à Jésus) et du Nouveau Testament.\nListe des livres inclus dans le Nouveau Testament\nLe Nouveau Testament comprend, selon l'ordre du canon occidental :\n- les quatre évangiles canoniques (Évangiles selon Matthieu, Marc, Luc, Jean) ;\n- les Actes des Apôtres ;\n- 14 épîtres, dont la plupart attribuées à Paul de Tarse ;\n- d'autres épîtres catholiques attribuées à d'autres disciples Simon-Pierre, Jacques le Juste, Jean de Zébédée, Judas de Jacques;\n- l’Apocalypse selon Jean de Zébédée.\nLe canon se clôt à 27 livres par autorité d'Église. De ce fait, il se ferme plus tôt qu'en Orient aux synodes régionaux de Carthage de 397 et de 419. Jusqu'aux dernières années du IVe siècle, il exclut l'épître aux Hébreux. Cette question n'est jamais traitée dans les conciles œcuméniques de la fin du siècle. Cette lacune assigne donc ces conciles au rôle de tribunal et au lieu d'espace où traiter des affaires des Églises dans un projet d'unification. En dépit des décrets de Gélase, les littératures apocalyptiques autres que celle de Jean seront recopiées et tenues pour partie prenante du Nouveau Testament jusqu'au milieu du Moyen Âge (XIIIe siècle)."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

      "label": "Bible en français Louis Segond (Traduction King James Version - KJV) Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament.\nAussi je vous recommande \"Concordance Biblique\" - vous trouver dans mes applications.\nAprès la mort de Segond, la Société biblique britannique et étrangère révise la traduction, en 1910, en choisissant d'autres termes doctrinaux plus conformes à la pensée protestante orthodoxe (par exemple : « sacrificateurs » à la place de « prêtres », « foi » à la place de « fidélité »)6. Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.\nJusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.\nLa Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues \"originelles\", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.\nLa version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux."

No other app has all those features. Even the scanned PDF documents are imported with titles recognised.\n\n◦ The best web support in text to speech apps - for the first time you can listen everything as both articles and headlines (including RSS feeds) are supported. Articles can be added from the headlines page for fully uninterrupted flow or from Safari. And you can send articles from the desktop browser with the Pocket extension.\n\n◦ The widest support for documents/office and e-book formats.\n\n◦ Knowledge and text annotation tools built-in.\n\n◦ Import the text from the physical books with the camera.\n\n◦ The widest choice of options to customize the voice, appearance and various other parameters.\n\n◦ Sync playlist items across Apple devices including with the macOS app and the current position in the text.\n\n◦ Apple Watch app that can play the content independently of the main app.\n\n◦ Export the text with annotations to .docx format\n\n◦ Functions of audio buttons can be customized for high productivity and accessibility. The widest selection of tools to control the speed and browse the text that is read aloud.\n\n◦ The app can be used with dozens of languages that have text-to-speech support on the device with automatic language detection from the content.\n\n◦ Export the text to the audio file.\n\n◦ The best in class accessibility. The only app that supports Dynamic Type accessibility sizes in the interface. It is completely free when used with VoiceOver and tested to be accessible by legally blind users.\n\n◦ Your data stays truly private, we collect only analytics data with no identifiable reference to the user or imported content even when the syncing is enabled.\n\n◦ Using the local voices instead of streaming limits the global warming effects.\n\nWith over 20,000 licenses sold and consistent ratings above 4 stars Speech Central is one of the leading global text-to-speech brands. It was nominated for the best iOS accessible app in 2020 and 2017 on AppleVis, the leading authority in the field of accessibility on Apple devices.\n\nBy moving your reading activities to commuting, walking, running, doing the housework or another activity you can save an hour each day. You'll also save eyes for better things while having your battery and data plan last significantly longer. Keeping the screen off grants that you won't get into the internet addiction and waste your time on unwanted things, and thus it can also help people with ADHD. \n\nThe app can be used as an assistive technology and helper for people with visual impairments (eyesight problems) and disabilities like dyslexia.\n\nSupported document types are: PDF (including scanned documents), Microsoft Word (.docx), Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx), OpenOffice/LibreOffice (.odt, .odp), .html, .mhtml, .webarchive, .txt, .rtf, supported ebook formats are .epub, DAISY and .fb2 and emails in .eml format.\n\nGet the app now and enjoy the most convenient text to audio!\n\nNotes:\n- The free version has a daily limitation in the number of articles that you can add to it which is removed by purchasing the Pro add-on.\n- Some features are available only on the latest version of the operating system.\n- The license is valid only for this operating system. Other operating systems have separate licenses.\n- DRM protected books (e.g. Kindle books) are locked to their respective vendor apps and cannot be imported into the app.\n- For languages other than English the support is provided using the auto-translation tools"

      "label": "Bible King James Version with Apocrypha\nThe King James Version (KJV), commonly known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin.\nThe Biblical apocrypha (from the Greek word aπόκρυφος, apókruphos, meaning \"hidden\") denotes the collection of ancient books found, in some editions of the Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments or as an appendix after the New Testament. Although the term apocrypha had been in use since the 5th century, it was in Luther's Bible of 1534 that the Apocrypha was first published as a separate intertestamental section. Luther was making a polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were not received as canonical. Although his statement was controversial in his day, Jerome was later titled a Doctor of the Church and his authority was also cited in the Anglican statement in 1571 of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nKing James Version\nThe English-language King James Version (KJV) of 1611 followed the lead of the Luther Bible in using an inter-testamental section labelled \"Books called Apocrypha\", or just \"Apocrypha\" at the running page header. The KJV followed the Geneva Bible of 1560 almost exactly (variations are marked below). The section contains the following:\n1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\nTobit\nJudith (\"Judeth\" in Geneva)\nRest of Esther (Vulgate Esther 10:4-16:24)\nWisdom\nEcclesiasticus (also known as Sirach)\nBaruch and the Epistle of Jeremy (\"Jeremiah\" in Geneva) (all part of Vulgate Baruch)\nSong of the Three Children (Vulgate Daniel 3:24-90)\nStory of Susanna (Vulgate Daniel 13)\nThe Idol Bel and the Dragon (Vulgate Daniel 14)\nPrayer of Manasses (follows 2 Chronicles in Geneva)\n1 Maccabees\n2 Maccabees\nIncluded in this list are those books of the Clementine Vulgate that were not in Luther's canon. These are the books most frequently referred to by the casual appellation \"the Apocrypha\". These same books are also listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Despite being placed in the Apocrypha, in the table of lessons at the front of some printings of the King James Bible, these books are included under the Old Testament."

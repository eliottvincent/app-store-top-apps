      "label": "Bible en français Louis Segond (Traduction King James Version - KJV) Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament.\nAussi je vous recommande \"Concordance Biblique\" - vous trouver dans mes applications.\nAprès la mort de Segond, la Société biblique britannique et étrangère révise la traduction, en 1910, en choisissant d'autres termes doctrinaux plus conformes à la pensée protestante orthodoxe (par exemple : « sacrificateurs » à la place de « prêtres », « foi » à la place de « fidélité »)6. Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.\nJusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.\nLa Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues \"originelles\", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.\nLa version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

      "label": "This application is the mobile version of the website of the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service (RCIPS). This mobile application, available for iPhone, makes the information on the website easily accessible anywhere. Users will have crime press releases and public safety information, as well as road closure and traffic accident updates, displayed in a readable format on their phones.  Notification options further enable residents to be updated with this practical information in real time.\n\nIn addition to being better informed, this mobile app also empowers the public to communicate with police. The “Submit a Tip” feature is a direct channel for the public to use their phone to send police text, photos or videos of up to 8MB of any information or activity that they think the police should know about. This information can be sent anonymously, but if the sender wants a response there is an option to leave contact information. There is no way for police to determine the sender of this information unless it is disclosed to us in the form provided.  This feature, if widely used, promises an exciting and convenient new way for the community to build a stronger relationship with police and work with us to solve crime and make our islands safer. \n\nThe app also places the names and mobile numbers of our Community Beat Officers at the fingertips of the public through our “Beat Officers” button. An interactive beat map describes the beats around the islands, alongside the photos and contact information the officers assigned to them. A cornerstone of our community policing ethic is to make ourselves accessible and responsive to the community members and their concerns.  This mobile application only enhances this accessibility several times over, and fosters the kind of real connection between officers and community members that can solve crime.\n\nAll other content from the website is also accessible via the app, with an emphasis on making information about careers with the police, as well as practical instructions on administrative matters, easy to find.\n\nIn sum, this is a real tool of information and communication that we feel can be of great benefit to the public as a whole. The RCIPS believes that informed citizens are safer citizens, and strives to earn the public’s trust by keeping the people of the Cayman Islands reliably informed of those happenings in which there is a public safety interest. The RCIPS also believes that the information the community has to share with police is just as important as the information the police have to share with the community. This mobile app will undoubtedly make this communication and partnership stronger, to everyone’s benefit. We urge everyone living on the islands to download this free app and use it to work more closely with us to preserve the safety and security of the Cayman Islands."

      "label": "Bible en français Louis Segond (Traduction King James Version - KJV) Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament.\nAprès la mort de Segond, la Société biblique britannique et étrangère révise la traduction, en 1910, en choisissant d'autres termes doctrinaux plus conformes à la pensée protestante orthodoxe (par exemple : « sacrificateurs » à la place de « prêtres », « foi » à la place de « fidélité »)6. Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.\nJusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.\nLa Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues \"originelles\", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.\nLa version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux."

You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "The Noble Quran, also informally known as the Hilali-Khan translation\n\nInterpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an (1999) by Darussalam (first published 1977) is translated by Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali. This translation is among the most widely read translations in the world, primarily because it is the officially promoted translation of the Saudi Government.\n\nThis English translation was sponsored by the Saudi government and is provided free. It has been reported to be the most popular and \"Now the most widely disseminated Qur'an in most Islamic bookstores and Sunni mosques throughout the English-speaking world, this new translation is meant to replace the Yusuf 'Ali edition and comes with a seal of approval from both the University of Medina and the Saudi Dar al-Ifta. This venture utilizes mainstream classical sources of commentaries namely, Tabari, Qurtubi, and Ibn Kathir.\n\nAs with any translation of the original Arabic into another language, in this case English, this is an interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an (Word of God). The translation is heavily interspersed with commentaries and notes from At-Tabari, Al-Qurtubi and Ibn Kathir.\n\nMushin Khan completed the translation in twelve years, during which he consulted a number of English versions of the Qur'an but had found that they had ambiguity, shortcomings and dogmatic errors. So later, in association with Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali, he undertook the task of interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an providing evidences from the authentic sources for clarification.\n\nAbdul Malik Mujahid also said that Khan and Hilali behested that Darussalam Publishers and Distributors bring about a summarized edition in one volume:\n\"Its popularity among the readers encouraged them to prepare a comprehensive version of the interpretation of the meanings of the Qur'an in nine volumes comprising a number of Ahadith from Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim and other books with comments from Tafsir At-Tabd, Tafsir AI-Qurtubi and Tafsir Ibn Kathir, where necessary to elaborate upon the Qur'anic Verses.\"\n\nThe Quran is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (Arabic: الله‎, Allah). It is widely regarded as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language. Muslims consider the Quran to be the only book that has been protected by God from distortion or corruption. However, some significant textual variations (employing different wordings) and deficiencies in the Arabic script mean the relationship between the text of today's Quran and an original text is unclear. Quranic chapters are called suras and verses are called ayahs."

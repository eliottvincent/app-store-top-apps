      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "Bible Darby en français (FRDBY)\nLa Sainte Bible de John Nelson Darby (a l'origine de la doctrine du dispensationalisme) : a partir du grec et de l'hébreu. J.N. Darby a également traduit la Bible en anglais et en allemand. Elle fait partie des Bibles en français dont le texte est actuellement dans le domaine public.\nAncien Testament et du Nouveau Testament\n\nAncien Testament\nDans le christianisme, on appelle Ancien Testament ou Ancienne Alliance1, l'ensemble des écrits de la Bible hébraïque, textes hébreux antérieurs a la vie de Jésus, laquelle est relatée dans le Nouveau Testament (en grec : H Παλαια Διαθηκη / Hê Palaià Diathếkê).\nL'Ancien Testament rassemble des écrits religieux juifs. Pour les chrétiens, la Bible se compose de l'Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament. L'Ancien Testament comprend les parties suivantes : le Pentateuque, les livres historiques, les Hagiographes et les Prophètes2.\nLe mot testament vient du mot grec διαθηκη / diathếkê : testament, contrat, convention) traduit en latin par testamentum (testament ; témoignage). Le mot grec a un sens plus large que le mot latin : celui de contrat ou « alliance ».\nl est difficile de situer le moment a partir duquel l'Ancien Testament est constitué en Canon par les chrétiens. Au IIe siècle, l'Église de Rome décide de rejeter l'hérésie de Marcion, qui prétend supprimer toute référence aux écrits vétéro-testamentaires. Ce n'est que plus tard que le Canon de la Bible chrétienne est constitué.\nLe plan du canon de l'Ancien Testament selon la Septante est le suivant6 :\n- Pentateuque (Torah) : Genèse, Exode, Lévitique, Nombres et Deutéronome\n- Les livres historiques : Josué, Juges, Ruth, I-II Samuel, I-II Rois, I-II Chroniques, Esdras, Néhémie, Esther, Tobit*, Judith*, I-II Maccabées*\n- Les Hagiographes : Job, Psaumes, Proverbes, Ecclésiaste, Cantique des Cantiques, Sagesse de Salomon*, Ecclésiastique*\n- Les Prophètes : Esaïe, Jérémie, Lamentations, Baruch*, Ezéchiel, Daniel, Osée, Joël, Amos, Abdias, Jonas, Michée, Nahum, Habaquq, Sophonie, Aggée, Zacharie, Malachie\nNouveau Testament\nLe Nouveau Testament (en grec : H Καινη Διαθηκη / Hê Kainề Diathếkê), est l’ensemble des écrits relatifs a la vie de Jésus et a l'enseignement de ses premiers disciples qui ont été reconnus comme « canoniques » par les autorités chrétiennes au terme d'un processus de plusieurs siècles.\nLe mot « testament » vient du mot grec διαθηκη (diathếkê : « testament, contrat, convention ») traduit en latin par testamentum (testament, témoignage). Le mot grec a un sens plus large (celui de contrat) que le mot latin. Aussi certains préfèrent-ils le traduire par Alliance.\nLes chrétiens considèrent que la Bible se compose de l’Ancien Testament (écrits antérieurs à Jésus) et du Nouveau Testament.\nListe des livres inclus dans le Nouveau Testament\nLe Nouveau Testament comprend, selon l'ordre du canon occidental :\n- les quatre évangiles canoniques (Évangiles selon Matthieu, Marc, Luc, Jean) ;\n- les Actes des Apôtres ;\n- 14 épîtres, dont la plupart attribuées à Paul de Tarse ;\n- d'autres épîtres catholiques attribuées à d'autres disciples Simon-Pierre, Jacques le Juste, Jean de Zébédée, Judas de Jacques;\n- l’Apocalypse selon Jean de Zébédée.\nLe canon se clôt à 27 livres par autorité d'Église. De ce fait, il se ferme plus tôt qu'en Orient aux synodes régionaux de Carthage de 397 et de 419. Jusqu'aux dernières années du IVe siècle, il exclut l'épître aux Hébreux. Cette question n'est jamais traitée dans les conciles œcuméniques de la fin du siècle. Cette lacune assigne donc ces conciles au rôle de tribunal et au lieu d'espace où traiter des affaires des Églises dans un projet d'unification. En dépit des décrets de Gélase, les littératures apocalyptiques autres que celle de Jean seront recopiées et tenues pour partie prenante du Nouveau Testament jusqu'au milieu du Moyen Âge (XIIIe siècle)."

It is considered an apocryphal book as well as a part of the Pseudepigrapha (literally means “falsely ascribed” is a collection of works supposedly written by a biblical character), although it is not a part of the canonical Apocrypha.\n\nOnce considered to be of Christian origin because of its obvious references to Christ, ten fragments of The Book of Enoch have been found at Qumran in the Dead Sea Scrolls, it is known to have existed in its present form since at least the 2nd Century BC.\n\nThe book was believed to have been composed by Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. Most critics and scholars believe it was begun in the second century BC and was a collection of works that includes writings for the first century BC as well. Some believe it contains the actual words of Enoch and that it was handed down through the ages. There is no real way to know for certain if that is so. The only thing we know for certain is that fragments of the book date back to the 2nd century BC.\n\nIt is generally believed that the Apostles and the writers of the New Testament were fully aware of the Book of Enoch also called 1 Enoch. In fact, it is directly quoted in the Bible:\n\nJude 1:14-15 “And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, {15} To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him”"

This free download includes our search engine function also found in the paid app, and links the 3100 transliterated terms found in the Eth Cepher to a quick definition and pronunciation guide. Should you download the complete version of the Eth Cepher, you will enjoy all 87 books, including Chanok, Yovheliym, Yashar, 2 Baruk, and others, together with our notetaking, highlighting, and copying function, and our unique Lexicon, also incorporated into the App.  \n\nThe Hebrew word eth (את) means divine, and the Hebrew word cepher (ספר) means book, scroll, letter or writing. Hence, the את CEPHER is the “Divine Book”. This collection of sacred scripture restores much of what has been removed and/or incorrectly interpreted in the Bible for centuries!\n\n• Sets forth a translation, rather than a substitution of the names of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n• Transliterates over 3,100 other Hebrew names and places without substitution.\n• Omitted in other translations, the את has been restored over 10,000 times.\n• Corrects the errors (for the first time) in Shiyr HaShiriym (Song of Solomon), Yeshayahu (Isaiah) 14, Zakaryahu (Zechariah) 5, Mattithyahu (Matthew) 23, and corrects several other notorious errors found in virtually all previous English translations.\n• Restores the 29th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles chronicling Paul’s journey to Spain.\n\nThe Cepher App allows you to easily search the scriptures by keyword, book, chapter or verse and includes:\n\n• The Daily Hebrew Prayer.\n• Links to our Weekly Torah Portion, Dr. Stephen Pidgeon’s blog, articles and other free downloads available our website."

      "label": "Bible en français Louis Segond (Traduction King James Version - KJV) Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament.\nAussi je vous recommande \"Concordance Biblique\" - vous trouver dans mes applications.\nAprès la mort de Segond, la Société biblique britannique et étrangère révise la traduction, en 1910, en choisissant d'autres termes doctrinaux plus conformes à la pensée protestante orthodoxe (par exemple : « sacrificateurs » à la place de « prêtres », « foi » à la place de « fidélité »)6. Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.\nJusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.\nLa Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues \"originelles\", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.\nLa version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux."

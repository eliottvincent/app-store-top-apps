Explore Amazon Charts best sellers and titles across genres like romance, science fiction, children’s books, self-help, religion, nonfiction, and more—and try any book with a free sample straight from the Kindle app.\n\n• Kindle Unlimited members can enjoy unlimited reading and listening, with the freedom to explore over 1 million titles, thousands of audiobooks, and current magazines. \n\n• Over 1,000 books, magazines, comics, and more included with Amazon Prime.\n\n• Kindle Vella brings you stories released one short episode at a time. The first three episodes of every story are always free--after that, purchase Tokens and redeem them to unlock episodes. Tokens may only be used to unlock Kindle Vella story episodes and are available for In-App purchase. Kindle Vella and In-App purchase of Tokens are currently only available in the US. \n\nGO BEYOND PAPER\nTurn your iPhone or iPad into a book with the free Kindle app—so you can read anytime, anywhere. Explore these reading features in the Kindle app:\n\n• Read your way. Customize your text size, font type, margins, text alignment, and orientation (portrait or landscape)—and choose whether to turn pages from left to right or continuously scroll. Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

Enoch contains unique material on the origins of demons and Nephilim, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why the Genesis flood was morally necessary, and prophetic exposition of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah.\n\nThe Book of Jubilees claims to present \"the history of the division of the days of the Law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the jubilees of the world\" as revealed to Moses (in addition to the Torah or \"Instruction\") by angels while he was on Mount Sinai for forty days and forty nights. The chronology given in Jubilees is based on multiples of seven; the jubilees are periods of 49 years (seven \"year-weeks\"), into which all of time has been divided.\n\nThe Book of Jasher, which means the Book of the Upright or the Book of the Just Man, is a book mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, often interpreted as a lost non-canonical book.\n\nThe Apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nApocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books includes these books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and Laodiceans.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV 1611) are included.\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThank you for using the Books of Jubilees, Jasher, Enoch app."

      "label": "The Noble Quran, also informally known as the Hilali-Khan translation\n\nInterpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an (1999) by Darussalam (first published 1977) is translated by Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali. This translation is among the most widely read translations in the world, primarily because it is the officially promoted translation of the Saudi Government.\n\nThis English translation was sponsored by the Saudi government and is provided free. It has been reported to be the most popular and \"Now the most widely disseminated Qur'an in most Islamic bookstores and Sunni mosques throughout the English-speaking world, this new translation is meant to replace the Yusuf 'Ali edition and comes with a seal of approval from both the University of Medina and the Saudi Dar al-Ifta. This venture utilizes mainstream classical sources of commentaries namely, Tabari, Qurtubi, and Ibn Kathir.\n\nAs with any translation of the original Arabic into another language, in this case English, this is an interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an (Word of God). The translation is heavily interspersed with commentaries and notes from At-Tabari, Al-Qurtubi and Ibn Kathir.\n\nMushin Khan completed the translation in twelve years, during which he consulted a number of English versions of the Qur'an but had found that they had ambiguity, shortcomings and dogmatic errors. So later, in association with Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali, he undertook the task of interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an providing evidences from the authentic sources for clarification.\n\nAbdul Malik Mujahid also said that Khan and Hilali behested that Darussalam Publishers and Distributors bring about a summarized edition in one volume:\n\"Its popularity among the readers encouraged them to prepare a comprehensive version of the interpretation of the meanings of the Qur'an in nine volumes comprising a number of Ahadith from Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim and other books with comments from Tafsir At-Tabd, Tafsir AI-Qurtubi and Tafsir Ibn Kathir, where necessary to elaborate upon the Qur'anic Verses.\"\n\nThe Quran is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (Arabic: الله‎, Allah). It is widely regarded as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language. Muslims consider the Quran to be the only book that has been protected by God from distortion or corruption. However, some significant textual variations (employing different wordings) and deficiencies in the Arabic script mean the relationship between the text of today's Quran and an original text is unclear. Quranic chapters are called suras and verses are called ayahs."

      "label": "Bible King James Version with Apocrypha\nThe King James Version (KJV), commonly known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin.\nThe Biblical apocrypha (from the Greek word aπόκρυφος, apókruphos, meaning \"hidden\") denotes the collection of ancient books found, in some editions of the Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments or as an appendix after the New Testament. Although the term apocrypha had been in use since the 5th century, it was in Luther's Bible of 1534 that the Apocrypha was first published as a separate intertestamental section. Luther was making a polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were not received as canonical. Although his statement was controversial in his day, Jerome was later titled a Doctor of the Church and his authority was also cited in the Anglican statement in 1571 of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nKing James Version\nThe English-language King James Version (KJV) of 1611 followed the lead of the Luther Bible in using an inter-testamental section labelled \"Books called Apocrypha\", or just \"Apocrypha\" at the running page header. The KJV followed the Geneva Bible of 1560 almost exactly (variations are marked below). The section contains the following:\n1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\nTobit\nJudith (\"Judeth\" in Geneva)\nRest of Esther (Vulgate Esther 10:4-16:24)\nWisdom\nEcclesiasticus (also known as Sirach)\nBaruch and the Epistle of Jeremy (\"Jeremiah\" in Geneva) (all part of Vulgate Baruch)\nSong of the Three Children (Vulgate Daniel 3:24-90)\nStory of Susanna (Vulgate Daniel 13)\nThe Idol Bel and the Dragon (Vulgate Daniel 14)\nPrayer of Manasses (follows 2 Chronicles in Geneva)\n1 Maccabees\n2 Maccabees\nIncluded in this list are those books of the Clementine Vulgate that were not in Luther's canon. These are the books most frequently referred to by the casual appellation \"the Apocrypha\". These same books are also listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Despite being placed in the Apocrypha, in the table of lessons at the front of some printings of the King James Bible, these books are included under the Old Testament."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

      "label": "Bible en français Louis Segond (Traduction King James Version - KJV) Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament.\nAussi je vous recommande \"Concordance Biblique\" - vous trouver dans mes applications.\nAprès la mort de Segond, la Société biblique britannique et étrangère révise la traduction, en 1910, en choisissant d'autres termes doctrinaux plus conformes à la pensée protestante orthodoxe (par exemple : « sacrificateurs » à la place de « prêtres », « foi » à la place de « fidélité »)6. Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.\nJusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.\nLa Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues \"originelles\", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.\nLa version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux."

      "label": "The apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n+   Audio: TTS (Text-To-Speech). Have the books read aloud to you or listen to it as you read along.\n+   All Free, it is 100% free to download and to use. There is also NO in-app purchase and NO hidden fee!.\n+   All OFFLINE! There is no need for an internet connection.\n+   Auto-scrolling in a single page permits continuous reading through the entire book without having to flip a page or touching the screen.\n+   Full-Screen mode is available.\n+   Bookmarks can be placed at any place in multiple books.\n+   Notepad: one click on any verse number to copy and paste that verse into the notepad.\n+   Notes can be saved and transferred.\n+   Highlight: 4 different shades and 3 different levels of intensity to choose from.\n+   Big Fonts and Bold Fonts are available! Easy to see huge fonts.\n+   Searchable keywords within each book.\n+   Feel free to adjust the font size, word spacing, line height, background color, and page margins for optimal reading.\n+   3 verse layout modes.\n+   Resume button that allows you to resume where you last left off.\n+   Landscape or portrait orientation available.\n+   Free Bible App from the same developer, The King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download.\n+   Many more features!\n\nApocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books includes these books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and Laodiceans.\n\nMany claim the apocrypha should never have been included in the first place, raising doubt about its validity and believing it was not God-inspired (for instance, a reference about magic seems inconsistent with the rest of the Bible: Tobit chapter 6, verses 5-8). Others believe it is valid and that it should never have been removed- that it was considered part of the Bible for nearly 2,000 years before it was recently removed a little more than 100 years ago. Some say it was removed because of not finding the books in the original Hebrew manuscripts. Others claim it wasn't removed by the church, but by printers to cut costs in distributing Bibles in the United States. Both sides tend to cite the same verses that warn against adding or subtracting from the Bible: Revelation 22:18. The word 'apocrypha' means 'hidden.' Fragments of Dead Sea Scrolls dating back to before 70 A.D. contained parts of the apocrypha books in Hebrew, including Sirach and Tobit.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download within the app for free.\n\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThe World English Bible (WEB) is a complete translation of the Holy Bible in normal modern English.\n\nThank you for using Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books."

      "label": "This Application Helps Kids to learn some good lessons about good habits to follow in life. You can help your kids build their moral values by reading this moral stories in their formative years. These stories are written in simple English and improve their reading skills in a fun way. The app present a book story with moral massage for the children. Great stories for all kiddies out there.\n\nKids are so nice by constitution that they love to hear stories from their dad or mom or from their grandpa or grandma and even from their teachers. Some of the stories go by the name of Aesop whose contribution is great and whose identity is shredded with mystery. Some stories are successfully set inside the great epics of India and Rome. Some are still alive in the folktales which people of different regions have managed to preserve naturally. The great stores of moral stories are the religious texts. Parables of the Bible and stories of the Bhagvadgita are wonderful and intriguing as they are very simple and simultaneously effective for ever.\n\nOne more example is the story of the tortoise and the hare. Children always to support the cute little hare. The end of the story declaring that the tortoise has won makes them sad. Still the moral of the story is inserted in their growing mind in the most natural way. We do not find any reason to advise them to be slow and to be steady at the same time. They learn that they should be honest to their task and that they should stick to their task. In this story two known animals have been used who are examples of great contrast in respect of their movement. The story contains softness even in its twists and turns. Nothing happens under the sun as the tortoise moves slowly and as the hare takes some rest.\n\nMorality stories penetrate into the character of the kids. It is not important to order them 'do this' and 'do not do that' with a voice of an authority. They learn to obey the seniors and the importance of being industrious. We want to teach them 'loyalty' 'punctuality' and at times we get exhausted as the result is not achieved. Morality stories have the inherent strength to assist the children identifying what is right and what is wrong or what one should do and what one should not.\n\nKnowing how to teach kids about morals and get desirable results begins with you. Do you adhere to a set of moral values? How consistently do you act in accordance with those moral values? You will never teach kids about morals successfully if your personal behavior fails to agree with your teaching.\n\nTo begin, then, sit before a mirror and objectively evaluate your own behavior. If you want to teach kids about honesty, determine how honest you are. If you want to teach kids about morals such as respect and integrity, check your own levels of those traits. Be ruthless.\n\nThese are only some application books that are definitely worth adding into your library for your kids to enjoy. These books are also great as bedtime stories for kids looking for a different type of story outside of fairytales and other make-believe story. It's also great because it's not so in-your-face when it comes to the topic of moral. This privacy police for the app: http://gubrax.com/Appprivacypolicy.htm"

      "label": "This application is the mobile version of the website of the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service (RCIPS). This mobile application, available for iPhone, makes the information on the website easily accessible anywhere. Users will have crime press releases and public safety information, as well as road closure and traffic accident updates, displayed in a readable format on their phones.  Notification options further enable residents to be updated with this practical information in real time.\n\nIn addition to being better informed, this mobile app also empowers the public to communicate with police. The “Submit a Tip” feature is a direct channel for the public to use their phone to send police text, photos or videos of up to 8MB of any information or activity that they think the police should know about. This information can be sent anonymously, but if the sender wants a response there is an option to leave contact information. There is no way for police to determine the sender of this information unless it is disclosed to us in the form provided.  This feature, if widely used, promises an exciting and convenient new way for the community to build a stronger relationship with police and work with us to solve crime and make our islands safer. \n\nThe app also places the names and mobile numbers of our Community Beat Officers at the fingertips of the public through our “Beat Officers” button. An interactive beat map describes the beats around the islands, alongside the photos and contact information the officers assigned to them. A cornerstone of our community policing ethic is to make ourselves accessible and responsive to the community members and their concerns.  This mobile application only enhances this accessibility several times over, and fosters the kind of real connection between officers and community members that can solve crime.\n\nAll other content from the website is also accessible via the app, with an emphasis on making information about careers with the police, as well as practical instructions on administrative matters, easy to find.\n\nIn sum, this is a real tool of information and communication that we feel can be of great benefit to the public as a whole. The RCIPS believes that informed citizens are safer citizens, and strives to earn the public’s trust by keeping the people of the Cayman Islands reliably informed of those happenings in which there is a public safety interest. The RCIPS also believes that the information the community has to share with police is just as important as the information the police have to share with the community. This mobile app will undoubtedly make this communication and partnership stronger, to everyone’s benefit. We urge everyone living on the islands to download this free app and use it to work more closely with us to preserve the safety and security of the Cayman Islands."

      "label": "Welcome to the Tyndale Bibles App! This app comes with a streamed version of the complete New Living Translation Bible text, as well as full-access to many popular Tyndale titles to try for a limited time.\n\nFeatured content available within the app:\n\nThe Breathe Bible New Testament provides you with a remarkably vivid listening experience that transports you into the world of the Bible. Performed in the New Living Translation by a cast of internationally acclaimed film, television, and recording artists—including Kevin Sorbo, John Rhys-Davies, and Josh Lucas—you can listen to this incredible Bible audio production as the corresponding Bible text scrolls in your app. Experience the Bible in all of its power, inspiration, and intrigue with cinema-quality sound and an original music score. It’s an experience you will never forget.\n\nThe Swindoll Study Bible offers the best of Charles Swindoll’s wit, charm, pastoral insight, and wise biblical study directly to you as you study God’s Word. Chuck’s warm, personal style comes across on every page, and his informed, practical insights get straight to the heart of the Bible’s message for the world today. Reading each part of this study Bible is like hearing Charles speak God’s Word directly to your heart. It will both encourage readers’ faith and draw them deeper into the study of God’s Word.\n\nThe New Living Translation is based on the most recent scholarship in the theory of translation. The challenge for the translators was to create a text that would make the same impact in the life of modern readers that the original text had for the original readers. In the New Living Translation, this is accomplished by translating entire thoughts (rather than just words) into natural, everyday English. The end result is a translation that is easy to read and understand and that accurately communicates the meaning of the original text.\n\nHere is a complete listing of the NLT Bibles and devotional books that are available with a free trial:\n\n- Life Application Study Bible\n- NLT Study Bible\n- Life Recovery Bible\n- Every Man's Bible\n- Daily Walk Bible \n- New Believer's Bible\n- Diario Vivir Biblia de Estudio (Study Bible in Spanish)\n- Beyond Suffering\n- Jesus Centered Bible\n- Swindoll Study Bible\n- One Year Devotionals (Men's, Woman's, Teen, Love Languages, many more)\n\nFeatures:\n- Quick, seamless navigation\n- Scrolling Bible text while the audio plays, providing a simultaneous reading and listening experience\n- Flip back and forth from your Bible to note-taking during lessons with one touch and not miss a thing \n- No internet connection needed for downloaded items\n- Select, copy and paste multiple verses easily and quickly \n- Margin notes allow you to write notes for a specific passage \n- Night mode for low light reading \n- Both word and verse selection for highlights \n- Facebook and Twitter sharing \n- Highlighting allows readers to easily emphasize verses or passages \n- Full-text search by OT, NT or current book allows users to quickly find words and study topics \n- Bookmark your favorite passages for quick future reference or make your own personal studies \n- Powerful folder system allows users to organize notes and bookmarks \n- History folder and back button \n- Portrait / Landscape mode \n- Font sizes can be easily changed \n- Easily e-mail notes to yourself, friends or family \n- Red-letter functionality\n- Autoscroll with adjustable speed \n- Synchronize all your notes, bookmarks, margin notes and highlights across all iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices \n- AirPrint enabled"

Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip.

Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

It was written by twenty-nine eminent scholars of the day who were also full-time preachers. These writers also represent every important branch of Protestantism. The Expositor's Bible may thus be regarded as an inter-denominational exposition. It conclusively demonstrates the hearty agreement of all thoughtful persons on the profound realities and essentials of the Christian Faith. It shows how this Faith is to be preached with the conviction and persuasiveness which its opulent gospel justly merits.\nThe Gold Medallion Award-winning Expositor’s Bible Commentary is a major contribution to the study and understanding of the Scriptures. Providing pastors and Bible students with a comprehensive and scholarly tool for the exposition of the Scriptures and the teaching and proclamation of their message, this work has become a staple of seminary and college libraries and pastors’ studies worldwide."

She is in her mid-forties and lives alone. James had never thought of her like that before he had accidentally seen her hot naked body in the laundry room.\n\n-- Lucy has always been a good girl, and from day one, her parents have taught her that the most valuable asset she can offer the world is her purity. Her innocence. One can only imagine how enraged and offended her parents would be if they found out.\n\n-- When Amber's mother announced that she would remarry, Amber knew her feelings for James, her future stepfather, were inappropriate. She tried to push her fantasies to older students at the college, but none of them ever seemed to satisfy her.

      "label": "Bible Darby en français (FRDBY)\nLa Sainte Bible de John Nelson Darby (a l'origine de la doctrine du dispensationalisme) : a partir du grec et de l'hébreu. J.N. Darby a également traduit la Bible en anglais et en allemand. Elle fait partie des Bibles en français dont le texte est actuellement dans le domaine public.\nAncien Testament et du Nouveau Testament\n\nAncien Testament\nDans le christianisme, on appelle Ancien Testament ou Ancienne Alliance1, l'ensemble des écrits de la Bible hébraïque, textes hébreux antérieurs a la vie de Jésus, laquelle est relatée dans le Nouveau Testament (en grec : H Παλαια Διαθηκη / Hê Palaià Diathếkê).\nL'Ancien Testament rassemble des écrits religieux juifs. Pour les chrétiens, la Bible se compose de l'Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament. L'Ancien Testament comprend les parties suivantes : le Pentateuque, les livres historiques, les Hagiographes et les Prophètes2.\nLe mot testament vient du mot grec διαθηκη / diathếkê : testament, contrat, convention) traduit en latin par testamentum (testament ; témoignage). Le mot grec a un sens plus large que le mot latin : celui de contrat ou « alliance ».\nl est difficile de situer le moment a partir duquel l'Ancien Testament est constitué en Canon par les chrétiens. Au IIe siècle, l'Église de Rome décide de rejeter l'hérésie de Marcion, qui prétend supprimer toute référence aux écrits vétéro-testamentaires. Ce n'est que plus tard que le Canon de la Bible chrétienne est constitué.\nLe plan du canon de l'Ancien Testament selon la Septante est le suivant6 :\n- Pentateuque (Torah) : Genèse, Exode, Lévitique, Nombres et Deutéronome\n- Les livres historiques : Josué, Juges, Ruth, I-II Samuel, I-II Rois, I-II Chroniques, Esdras, Néhémie, Esther, Tobit*, Judith*, I-II Maccabées*\n- Les Hagiographes : Job, Psaumes, Proverbes, Ecclésiaste, Cantique des Cantiques, Sagesse de Salomon*, Ecclésiastique*\n- Les Prophètes : Esaïe, Jérémie, Lamentations, Baruch*, Ezéchiel, Daniel, Osée, Joël, Amos, Abdias, Jonas, Michée, Nahum, Habaquq, Sophonie, Aggée, Zacharie, Malachie\nNouveau Testament\nLe Nouveau Testament (en grec : H Καινη Διαθηκη / Hê Kainề Diathếkê), est l’ensemble des écrits relatifs a la vie de Jésus et a l'enseignement de ses premiers disciples qui ont été reconnus comme « canoniques » par les autorités chrétiennes au terme d'un processus de plusieurs siècles.\nLe mot « testament » vient du mot grec διαθηκη (diathếkê : « testament, contrat, convention ») traduit en latin par testamentum (testament, témoignage). Le mot grec a un sens plus large (celui de contrat) que le mot latin. Aussi certains préfèrent-ils le traduire par Alliance.\nLes chrétiens considèrent que la Bible se compose de l’Ancien Testament (écrits antérieurs à Jésus) et du Nouveau Testament.\nListe des livres inclus dans le Nouveau Testament\nLe Nouveau Testament comprend, selon l'ordre du canon occidental :\n- les quatre évangiles canoniques (Évangiles selon Matthieu, Marc, Luc, Jean) ;\n- les Actes des Apôtres ;\n- 14 épîtres, dont la plupart attribuées à Paul de Tarse ;\n- d'autres épîtres catholiques attribuées à d'autres disciples Simon-Pierre, Jacques le Juste, Jean de Zébédée, Judas de Jacques;\n- l’Apocalypse selon Jean de Zébédée.\nLe canon se clôt à 27 livres par autorité d'Église. De ce fait, il se ferme plus tôt qu'en Orient aux synodes régionaux de Carthage de 397 et de 419. Jusqu'aux dernières années du IVe siècle, il exclut l'épître aux Hébreux. Cette question n'est jamais traitée dans les conciles œcuméniques de la fin du siècle. Cette lacune assigne donc ces conciles au rôle de tribunal et au lieu d'espace où traiter des affaires des Églises dans un projet d'unification. En dépit des décrets de Gélase, les littératures apocalyptiques autres que celle de Jean seront recopiées et tenues pour partie prenante du Nouveau Testament jusqu'au milieu du Moyen Âge (XIIIe siècle)."

      "label": "The New Living Translation was founded on the most recent scholarship in the theory of translation, with the goal of communicating the meaning of the ancient Bible texts as accurately as possible to the modern reader.\n\nIt seeks to preserve the freshness and readability of the original paraphrase while providing the accuracy and reliability of a translation prepared by a team of 90 biblical scholars.\n\nQuality of Translation:\n\nThe translators took on the challenge of producing a text that would have the same impact in the life of today's readers as the original text had for the original readers. The method employed to reach this goal in the New Living Translation, was to translate entire thoughts (instead of just words) into natural, everyday English. Therefore the NLT is a thought for thought, rather than word for word (literal) translation. As a result, it is easy to read and understand, while correctly conveying the original meaning of text."

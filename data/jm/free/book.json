Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip.

Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "Bible King James Version with Apocrypha\nThe King James Version (KJV), commonly known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin.\nThe Biblical apocrypha (from the Greek word aπόκρυφος, apókruphos, meaning \"hidden\") denotes the collection of ancient books found, in some editions of the Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments or as an appendix after the New Testament. Although the term apocrypha had been in use since the 5th century, it was in Luther's Bible of 1534 that the Apocrypha was first published as a separate intertestamental section. Luther was making a polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were not received as canonical. Although his statement was controversial in his day, Jerome was later titled a Doctor of the Church and his authority was also cited in the Anglican statement in 1571 of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nKing James Version\nThe English-language King James Version (KJV) of 1611 followed the lead of the Luther Bible in using an inter-testamental section labelled \"Books called Apocrypha\", or just \"Apocrypha\" at the running page header. The KJV followed the Geneva Bible of 1560 almost exactly (variations are marked below). The section contains the following:\n1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\nTobit\nJudith (\"Judeth\" in Geneva)\nRest of Esther (Vulgate Esther 10:4-16:24)\nWisdom\nEcclesiasticus (also known as Sirach)\nBaruch and the Epistle of Jeremy (\"Jeremiah\" in Geneva) (all part of Vulgate Baruch)\nSong of the Three Children (Vulgate Daniel 3:24-90)\nStory of Susanna (Vulgate Daniel 13)\nThe Idol Bel and the Dragon (Vulgate Daniel 14)\nPrayer of Manasses (follows 2 Chronicles in Geneva)\n1 Maccabees\n2 Maccabees\nIncluded in this list are those books of the Clementine Vulgate that were not in Luther's canon. These are the books most frequently referred to by the casual appellation \"the Apocrypha\". These same books are also listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Despite being placed in the Apocrypha, in the table of lessons at the front of some printings of the King James Bible, these books are included under the Old Testament."

      "label": "This is the original 1611 King James Bible with Apocrypha\nNo internet connection needed.\nThe King James Bible is the most printed book in the history of the world. Any so-called “1611” King James Version you buy today at the local Christian Bookstore is absolutely NOT the 1611. .. it is the 1769 Baskerville Birmingham revision, even though it admits that nowhere, and may even say “1611” in the front… it’s just not true. Prepare to be shocked! The spellings have been revised, and some words changed, in almost every printing done since 1769, and fourteen entire books plus extra prefatory features have been removed from almost every printing done since 1885!\nThe 1611 King James Bible was writen more than four hundred years ago when the English language was different. The original 1611 A.D. text, written in Early Modern English, shows the language in closer association with its Latin roots. Spelling was in Jacobean style which was not entirely standardized, but could be read phonetically. The original typeface was in Gothic style. Although both the typestyle and the older language may be considered difficult to read by some 21st Century English readers, the King James Version is recognized and respected for its beauty, cadence, and poetic feel.\nEnglish spelling differences in John 3:16\n- U = V (Example: loued = loved; gauve = gave)\n- y with 'e' above it was used as represent the 'thorn' character, which means 'the') \n- nn (Sonne = Son)\nOther spelling differences\n- V = U (Example: vnto = unto | See John 1:11)\n- VV = W (Example: svvord = sword) [The V was called a 'U', this is why we still call a W a 'double U']\n- I = J (Example: Iesus = Jesus | See John 1:17)\n- Long \"s\" letters look similar to \"f\" letters (Notice the 'Old Testament' type example on the right)"

It is arguably the easiest to read and understand for modern readers.\n\nThe World English Bible (also known as the WEB) is a free updated revision of the American Standard Version (ASV) (1901). It is one of the few public domain, modern-English translations of the entire Bible. The Bible was created by volunteers using the American Standard Version (ASV) as the base text as part of the ebible.org project.\n\nThe World English Bible (WEB) claims to be one of the few English-language Bibles custom translated to be understood by most English-speakers worldwide. Work on the World English Bible began in 1997 and it was first known as the American Standard Version (ASV).\n\nKing James Bible:\nThe King James Version is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English. The new translation was finished in 1611, 85 years after the first English translation of the New Testament (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version (KJV), quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and the rhythm of its prose have had a profound influence on the literature of the past 400 yrs.\n\nBooks:\nOld Testament\nGenesis\nExodus\nLeviticus\nNumbers\nDeuteronomy\nJoshua\nJudges\nRuth\n1 Samuel\n2 Samuel\n1 Kings\n2 Kings\n1 Chronicles\n2 Chronicles\nEzra\nNehemiah\nEsther\nJob\nPsalm\nProverbs\nEcclesiastes\nSong of Solomon\nIsaiah\nJeremiah\nLamentations\nEzekiel\nDaniel\nHosea\nJoel\nAmos\nObadiah\nJonah\nMicah\nNahum\nHabakkuk\nZephaniah\nHaggai\nZechariah\nMalachi\n\nNew Testament\nMatthew\nMark\nLuke\nJohn\nActs\nRomans\n1 Corinthians\n2 Corinthians\nGalatians\nEphesians\nPhilippians\nColossians\n1 Thessalonians\n2 Thessalonians\n1 Timothy\n2 Timothy\nTitus\nPhilemon\nHebrews\nJames\n1 Peter\n2 Peter\n1 John\n2 John\n3 John\nJude\nRevelation\n\nSearch in our app selection for Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books.\n\nThank you for using Bible: King James Version(KJV) & World English Bible(WEB) App."

      "label": "Bible Darby en français (FRDBY)\nLa Sainte Bible de John Nelson Darby (a l'origine de la doctrine du dispensationalisme) : a partir du grec et de l'hébreu. J.N. Darby a également traduit la Bible en anglais et en allemand. Elle fait partie des Bibles en français dont le texte est actuellement dans le domaine public.\nAncien Testament et du Nouveau Testament\n\nAncien Testament\nDans le christianisme, on appelle Ancien Testament ou Ancienne Alliance1, l'ensemble des écrits de la Bible hébraïque, textes hébreux antérieurs a la vie de Jésus, laquelle est relatée dans le Nouveau Testament (en grec : H Παλαια Διαθηκη / Hê Palaià Diathếkê).\nL'Ancien Testament rassemble des écrits religieux juifs. Pour les chrétiens, la Bible se compose de l'Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament. L'Ancien Testament comprend les parties suivantes : le Pentateuque, les livres historiques, les Hagiographes et les Prophètes2.\nLe mot testament vient du mot grec διαθηκη / diathếkê : testament, contrat, convention) traduit en latin par testamentum (testament ; témoignage). Le mot grec a un sens plus large que le mot latin : celui de contrat ou « alliance ».\nl est difficile de situer le moment a partir duquel l'Ancien Testament est constitué en Canon par les chrétiens. Au IIe siècle, l'Église de Rome décide de rejeter l'hérésie de Marcion, qui prétend supprimer toute référence aux écrits vétéro-testamentaires. Ce n'est que plus tard que le Canon de la Bible chrétienne est constitué.\nLe plan du canon de l'Ancien Testament selon la Septante est le suivant6 :\n- Pentateuque (Torah) : Genèse, Exode, Lévitique, Nombres et Deutéronome\n- Les livres historiques : Josué, Juges, Ruth, I-II Samuel, I-II Rois, I-II Chroniques, Esdras, Néhémie, Esther, Tobit*, Judith*, I-II Maccabées*\n- Les Hagiographes : Job, Psaumes, Proverbes, Ecclésiaste, Cantique des Cantiques, Sagesse de Salomon*, Ecclésiastique*\n- Les Prophètes : Esaïe, Jérémie, Lamentations, Baruch*, Ezéchiel, Daniel, Osée, Joël, Amos, Abdias, Jonas, Michée, Nahum, Habaquq, Sophonie, Aggée, Zacharie, Malachie\nNouveau Testament\nLe Nouveau Testament (en grec : H Καινη Διαθηκη / Hê Kainề Diathếkê), est l’ensemble des écrits relatifs a la vie de Jésus et a l'enseignement de ses premiers disciples qui ont été reconnus comme « canoniques » par les autorités chrétiennes au terme d'un processus de plusieurs siècles.\nLe mot « testament » vient du mot grec διαθηκη (diathếkê : « testament, contrat, convention ») traduit en latin par testamentum (testament, témoignage). Le mot grec a un sens plus large (celui de contrat) que le mot latin. Aussi certains préfèrent-ils le traduire par Alliance.\nLes chrétiens considèrent que la Bible se compose de l’Ancien Testament (écrits antérieurs à Jésus) et du Nouveau Testament.\nListe des livres inclus dans le Nouveau Testament\nLe Nouveau Testament comprend, selon l'ordre du canon occidental :\n- les quatre évangiles canoniques (Évangiles selon Matthieu, Marc, Luc, Jean) ;\n- les Actes des Apôtres ;\n- 14 épîtres, dont la plupart attribuées à Paul de Tarse ;\n- d'autres épîtres catholiques attribuées à d'autres disciples Simon-Pierre, Jacques le Juste, Jean de Zébédée, Judas de Jacques;\n- l’Apocalypse selon Jean de Zébédée.\nLe canon se clôt à 27 livres par autorité d'Église. De ce fait, il se ferme plus tôt qu'en Orient aux synodes régionaux de Carthage de 397 et de 419. Jusqu'aux dernières années du IVe siècle, il exclut l'épître aux Hébreux. Cette question n'est jamais traitée dans les conciles œcuméniques de la fin du siècle. Cette lacune assigne donc ces conciles au rôle de tribunal et au lieu d'espace où traiter des affaires des Églises dans un projet d'unification. En dépit des décrets de Gélase, les littératures apocalyptiques autres que celle de Jean seront recopiées et tenues pour partie prenante du Nouveau Testament jusqu'au milieu du Moyen Âge (XIIIe siècle)."

There are several (as many as five) separate works by this title, all composed much later than Biblical times. This particular one is a translation of a Hebrew book printed in 1613. Sepir Ha Yasher, the Hebrew title of this book, means the 'Book of the Upright', or 'the Upright or Correct Record'. This title was misread as 'Jasher', and at some point Jasher was treated as a proper name; however the pronoun 'the' (hebrew 'ha') never preceeds proper names.\n\nThis text covers much of the same ground as the traditional Mosaic books of the Bible, from the creation of the world to the death of Moses, albeit with several minor variations."

You can track the books that you're reading, want to read, etc. and read many of them right there.\n\nThis app is one reader's effort to create the ideal portable experience for taking advantage of Open Library's amazing collection.\n\nYou'll get the best experience out of this app on an iPad, but you can use it on a smaller screen (if you don't mind squinting).\n\nThe moment you open the app and log in, any books you've already saved on the Open Library site are laid out on your screen. You can sort them by title, author, publication date, and date saved, see which books are available to read, and open them with a single tap.\n\nOnce you've opened a book in the familiar reading interface, a tap at the top of the screen will trigger the full screen mode, removing every distraction and expanding the book pages to the limits of your screen for the perfect reading experience.\n\nOther features include:\n- Built-in search: find and add books to your shelves from inside the app.\n- Shelf management: move books between shelves, remove books, change the edition of a book.\n- Related title search: choose a book on your shelf and quickly find more books like it.\n- Checkout tracking: see at a glance how long you have left on limited-access books you've checked out.\n- Customization: choose which shelves you want to see and manage the size of the books and their titles.\n\nThis app is essentially an alternative interface to the Open Library site — all of your data is stored there, and the books you read are hosted online, not in the app. As a result, an active internet connection is required when you are using this app.\n\n\nOpen Library is an initiative of the Internet Archive, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form. The developer of this app has no legal or contractual relationship with Open Library or the Internet Archive, and bears no responsibility for the content found there."

      "label": "The Lost Books of the Bible and The Forgotten Books of Eden\n\nThe Lost Books of the Bible by Rutherford H. Platt, Jr., 1926\nThis is a collection of New Testament Apocrypha, including many works which were admired and read by the early Christians, but which were later excluded from the canonical Bible. It includes accounts of the young Jesus, particularly the Gospel of Mary and the Protevangelion, which provides additional folklore about the birth and youthful adventures of Jesus and which are missing now. Of note are the letters of Paul and Seneca, and the letters of Herod and Pilate, which are most likely a forgery, but add more depth to the question of the historicity of Jesus. There are also a number of non-canonical epistles, such as Laodiceans. Also worth a close read are the three books of the Shepherd of Hermas, which uses apocalyptic and symbolic imagery. This collection is an invaluable selection of portions of the New Testament which illustrates the fluid nature of the early Biblical canon, and provides access to all of the 'spare parts.'\nThe Forgotten Books of Eden by Rutherford H. Platt, Jr., 1926\nThis is a popularized translation of the OT pseudepigrapha, quasi-Biblical writings which never achieved canonical status (or inclusion in any of the official Apocrypha). This isn't to say that these documents are forgeries, just that for one reason or another they were not considered part of the Biblical text by the first millenium (C.E.) compilers. This book contains translations of all of the texts found in volume I of the weighty Oxford University Press Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, without any of the apparatus.\n\nYou can find here for free such popular books as: The Apostles' Creed, The Shepherd of Hermas, The First Book of Adam and Eve, The Gospel of Nicodemus and many others books which are missing of the Bible!"

      "label": "The “Little Stories” series is a collection of fairy tales in which your kid plays the main role. It's quite simple – just enter your kid's name and gender into the settings window and enjoy reading fairy tales about your son or daughter.\n\nTo make it even cooler, we've added beautiful melodies and wonderful pictures to help you raise your child by giving him or her only positive examples. Moreover, you can also make your own audiobooks! Just spend a few minutes to voice-over the story.\n\nLet love and kindness fill your family’s leisure time to make your life and the world around you happier!\n\nWhy “Little Stories”?\n• 1800+ pictures\n• Gender determines the choice of illustrations\n• 45 exciting fairy tales so far and more to come\n• Enchanting music accompanies each story\n• You can create audiobooks by recording your own voice!\n• 1st place in the “Entertainment” category of Rating Runet in 2018!\n• 1st place in the “App For Kids” category of Golden App in 2016!\n• 3rd place in the “Entertainment” category of Golden App in 2017!\n\nWe’d like to tell you more about the process behind creating stories for kids so that you have a better idea about the hard work we put into “Little Stories”.\n\n1) It all begins with searching for an author. He/she can live in any country of the world, but the important thing is that he/she is able to create an interesting and insightful story. Before writing a bedtime story, the author has to read the conditions first. For example, the story may not contain more than 50 scenes (each of which can consist of 146 symbols max.) otherwise the text won’t fit into the app. Once the story has been completed, the next stage can begin.\n\n2) It is now  time to create the storyboard. A storyboard is a selection of simple sketches for each of the illustrations of the story. It gives us a better idea about the visual images of the children’s story.\n\n3) Once the storyboard has been approved, we move on to searching for an illustrator. It should be noted that not all styles might be appropriate for a certain bedtime story and, therefore, it’s important to achieve a perfect fit between the story and the illustration style.\n\n4) Meanwhile, the composer creates the melody. Both the story itself and the artist’s illustrations serve as inspiration for the creation of music. The composer also has conditions to meet: the melody must be soothing and prepare children for a good night’s sleep since most often stories are read for bedtime.\n\n5) What’s more, we also translate our stories for kids into other languages.\n\n6) But that’s not the end! It’s important to see how the book for kids looks inside the app. Line breaks should be checked to make sure the text looks nice and neat. This is done by two professionals: the programmer and the tester.\n\n7) Only after this final step do we release the story for kids. This entire process might take anywhere from two to nine months. So, it’s a hard, but interesting, journey!\n\nWe continuously add new fairy tales to our collection! \nFairy tales are designed for kids aged 3+.\n\nFollow us on: facebook.com/diveomedia"

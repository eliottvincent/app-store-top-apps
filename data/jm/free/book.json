Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices.

Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

      "label": "Bible King James Version with Apocrypha\nThe King James Version (KJV), commonly known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin.\nThe Biblical apocrypha (from the Greek word aπόκρυφος, apókruphos, meaning \"hidden\") denotes the collection of ancient books found, in some editions of the Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments or as an appendix after the New Testament. Although the term apocrypha had been in use since the 5th century, it was in Luther's Bible of 1534 that the Apocrypha was first published as a separate intertestamental section. Luther was making a polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were not received as canonical. Although his statement was controversial in his day, Jerome was later titled a Doctor of the Church and his authority was also cited in the Anglican statement in 1571 of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nKing James Version\nThe English-language King James Version (KJV) of 1611 followed the lead of the Luther Bible in using an inter-testamental section labelled \"Books called Apocrypha\", or just \"Apocrypha\" at the running page header. The KJV followed the Geneva Bible of 1560 almost exactly (variations are marked below). The section contains the following:\n1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\nTobit\nJudith (\"Judeth\" in Geneva)\nRest of Esther (Vulgate Esther 10:4-16:24)\nWisdom\nEcclesiasticus (also known as Sirach)\nBaruch and the Epistle of Jeremy (\"Jeremiah\" in Geneva) (all part of Vulgate Baruch)\nSong of the Three Children (Vulgate Daniel 3:24-90)\nStory of Susanna (Vulgate Daniel 13)\nThe Idol Bel and the Dragon (Vulgate Daniel 14)\nPrayer of Manasses (follows 2 Chronicles in Geneva)\n1 Maccabees\n2 Maccabees\nIncluded in this list are those books of the Clementine Vulgate that were not in Luther's canon. These are the books most frequently referred to by the casual appellation \"the Apocrypha\". These same books are also listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Despite being placed in the Apocrypha, in the table of lessons at the front of some printings of the King James Bible, these books are included under the Old Testament."

You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "The “Little Stories” series is a collection of fairy tales in which your kid plays the main role. It's quite simple – just enter your kid's name and gender into the settings window and enjoy reading fairy tales about your son or daughter.\n\nTo make it even cooler, we've added beautiful melodies and wonderful pictures to help you raise your child by giving him or her only positive examples. Moreover, you can also make your own audiobooks! Just spend a few minutes to voice-over the story.\n\nLet love and kindness fill your family’s leisure time to make your life and the world around you happier!\n\nWhy “Little Stories”?\n• 1800+ pictures\n• Gender determines the choice of illustrations\n• 45 exciting fairy tales so far and more to come\n• Enchanting music accompanies each story\n• You can create audiobooks by recording your own voice!\n• 1st place in the “Entertainment” category of Rating Runet in 2018!\n• 1st place in the “App For Kids” category of Golden App in 2016!\n• 3rd place in the “Entertainment” category of Golden App in 2017!\n\nWe’d like to tell you more about the process behind creating stories for kids so that you have a better idea about the hard work we put into “Little Stories”.\n\n1) It all begins with searching for an author. He/she can live in any country of the world, but the important thing is that he/she is able to create an interesting and insightful story. Before writing a bedtime story, the author has to read the conditions first. For example, the story may not contain more than 50 scenes (each of which can consist of 146 symbols max.) otherwise the text won’t fit into the app. Once the story has been completed, the next stage can begin.\n\n2) It is now  time to create the storyboard. A storyboard is a selection of simple sketches for each of the illustrations of the story. It gives us a better idea about the visual images of the children’s story.\n\n3) Once the storyboard has been approved, we move on to searching for an illustrator. It should be noted that not all styles might be appropriate for a certain bedtime story and, therefore, it’s important to achieve a perfect fit between the story and the illustration style.\n\n4) Meanwhile, the composer creates the melody. Both the story itself and the artist’s illustrations serve as inspiration for the creation of music. The composer also has conditions to meet: the melody must be soothing and prepare children for a good night’s sleep since most often stories are read for bedtime.\n\n5) What’s more, we also translate our stories for kids into other languages.\n\n6) But that’s not the end! It’s important to see how the book for kids looks inside the app. Line breaks should be checked to make sure the text looks nice and neat. This is done by two professionals: the programmer and the tester.\n\n7) Only after this final step do we release the story for kids. This entire process might take anywhere from two to nine months. So, it’s a hard, but interesting, journey!\n\nWe continuously add new fairy tales to our collection! \nFairy tales are designed for kids aged 3+.\n\nFollow us on: facebook.com/diveomedia"

The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants.

      "label": "The Lost Books of the Bible and The Forgotten Books of Eden\n\nThe Lost Books of the Bible by Rutherford H. Platt, Jr., 1926\nThis is a collection of New Testament Apocrypha, including many works which were admired and read by the early Christians, but which were later excluded from the canonical Bible. It includes accounts of the young Jesus, particularly the Gospel of Mary and the Protevangelion, which provides additional folklore about the birth and youthful adventures of Jesus and which are missing now. Of note are the letters of Paul and Seneca, and the letters of Herod and Pilate, which are most likely a forgery, but add more depth to the question of the historicity of Jesus. There are also a number of non-canonical epistles, such as Laodiceans. Also worth a close read are the three books of the Shepherd of Hermas, which uses apocalyptic and symbolic imagery. This collection is an invaluable selection of portions of the New Testament which illustrates the fluid nature of the early Biblical canon, and provides access to all of the 'spare parts.'\nThe Forgotten Books of Eden by Rutherford H. Platt, Jr., 1926\nThis is a popularized translation of the OT pseudepigrapha, quasi-Biblical writings which never achieved canonical status (or inclusion in any of the official Apocrypha). This isn't to say that these documents are forgeries, just that for one reason or another they were not considered part of the Biblical text by the first millenium (C.E.) compilers. This book contains translations of all of the texts found in volume I of the weighty Oxford University Press Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, without any of the apparatus.\n\nYou can find here for free such popular books as: The Apostles' Creed, The Shepherd of Hermas, The First Book of Adam and Eve, The Gospel of Nicodemus and many others books which are missing of the Bible!"

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

      "label": "The apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n+   Audio: TTS (Text-To-Speech). Have the books read aloud to you or listen to it as you read along.\n+   All Free, it is 100% free to download and to use. There is also NO in-app purchase and NO hidden fee!.\n+   All OFFLINE! There is no need for an internet connection.\n+   Auto-scrolling in a single page permits continuous reading through the entire book without having to flip a page or touching the screen.\n+   Full-Screen mode is available.\n+   Bookmarks can be placed at any place in multiple books.\n+   Notepad: one click on any verse number to copy and paste that verse into the notepad.\n+   Notes can be saved and transferred.\n+   Highlight: 4 different shades and 3 different levels of intensity to choose from.\n+   Big Fonts and Bold Fonts are available! Easy to see huge fonts.\n+   Searchable keywords within each book.\n+   Feel free to adjust the font size, word spacing, line height, background color, and page margins for optimal reading.\n+   3 verse layout modes.\n+   Resume button that allows you to resume where you last left off.\n+   Landscape or portrait orientation available.\n+   Free Bible App from the same developer, The King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download.\n+   Many more features!\n\nApocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books includes these books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and Laodiceans.\n\nMany claim the apocrypha should never have been included in the first place, raising doubt about its validity and believing it was not God-inspired (for instance, a reference about magic seems inconsistent with the rest of the Bible: Tobit chapter 6, verses 5-8). Others believe it is valid and that it should never have been removed- that it was considered part of the Bible for nearly 2,000 years before it was recently removed a little more than 100 years ago. Some say it was removed because of not finding the books in the original Hebrew manuscripts. Others claim it wasn't removed by the church, but by printers to cut costs in distributing Bibles in the United States. Both sides tend to cite the same verses that warn against adding or subtracting from the Bible: Revelation 22:18. The word 'apocrypha' means 'hidden.' Fragments of Dead Sea Scrolls dating back to before 70 A.D. contained parts of the apocrypha books in Hebrew, including Sirach and Tobit.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download within the app for free.\n\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThe World English Bible (WEB) is a complete translation of the Holy Bible in normal modern English.\n\nThank you for using Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books."

It is considered an apocryphal book as well as a part of the Pseudepigrapha (literally means “falsely ascribed” is a collection of works supposedly written by a biblical character), although it is not a part of the canonical Apocrypha.\n\nOnce considered to be of Christian origin because of its obvious references to Christ, ten fragments of The Book of Enoch have been found at Qumran in the Dead Sea Scrolls, it is known to have existed in its present form since at least the 2nd Century BC.\n\nThe book was believed to have been composed by Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. Most critics and scholars believe it was begun in the second century BC and was a collection of works that includes writings for the first century BC as well. Some believe it contains the actual words of Enoch and that it was handed down through the ages. There is no real way to know for certain if that is so. The only thing we know for certain is that fragments of the book date back to the 2nd century BC.\n\nIt is generally believed that the Apostles and the writers of the New Testament were fully aware of the Book of Enoch also called 1 Enoch. In fact, it is directly quoted in the Bible:\n\nJude 1:14-15 “And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, {15} To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him”"

      "label": "The apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n+   Audio: TTS (Text-To-Speech). Have the books read aloud to you or listen to it as you read along.\n+   All Free, it is 100% free to download and to use. There is also NO in-app purchase and NO hidden fee!.\n+   All OFFLINE! There is no need for an internet connection.\n+   Auto-scrolling in a single page permits continuous reading through the entire book without having to flip a page or touching the screen.\n+   Full-Screen mode is available.\n+   Bookmarks can be placed at any place in multiple books.\n+   Notepad: one click on any verse number to copy and paste that verse into the notepad.\n+   Notes can be saved and transferred.\n+   Highlight: 4 different shades and 3 different levels of intensity to choose from.\n+   Big Fonts and Bold Fonts are available! Easy to see huge fonts.\n+   Searchable keywords within each book.\n+   Feel free to adjust the font size, word spacing, line height, background color, and page margins for optimal reading.\n+   3 verse layout modes.\n+   Resume button that allows you to resume where you last left off.\n+   Landscape or portrait orientation available.\n+   Free Bible App from the same developer, The King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download.\n+   Many more features!\n\nApocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books includes these books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and Laodiceans.\n\nMany claim the apocrypha should never have been included in the first place, raising doubt about its validity and believing it was not God-inspired (for instance, a reference about magic seems inconsistent with the rest of the Bible: Tobit chapter 6, verses 5-8). Others believe it is valid and that it should never have been removed- that it was considered part of the Bible for nearly 2,000 years before it was recently removed a little more than 100 years ago. Some say it was removed because of not finding the books in the original Hebrew manuscripts. Others claim it wasn't removed by the church, but by printers to cut costs in distributing Bibles in the United States. Both sides tend to cite the same verses that warn against adding or subtracting from the Bible: Revelation 22:18. The word 'apocrypha' means 'hidden.' Fragments of Dead Sea Scrolls dating back to before 70 A.D. contained parts of the apocrypha books in Hebrew, including Sirach and Tobit.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV) & The World English Bible (WEB) are available to download within the app for free.\n\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThe World English Bible (WEB) is a complete translation of the Holy Bible in normal modern English.\n\nThank you for using Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books."

      "label": "Bible King James Version with Apocrypha\nThe King James Version (KJV), commonly known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin.\nThe Biblical apocrypha (from the Greek word aπόκρυφος, apókruphos, meaning \"hidden\") denotes the collection of ancient books found, in some editions of the Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments or as an appendix after the New Testament. Although the term apocrypha had been in use since the 5th century, it was in Luther's Bible of 1534 that the Apocrypha was first published as a separate intertestamental section. Luther was making a polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were not received as canonical. Although his statement was controversial in his day, Jerome was later titled a Doctor of the Church and his authority was also cited in the Anglican statement in 1571 of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nKing James Version\nThe English-language King James Version (KJV) of 1611 followed the lead of the Luther Bible in using an inter-testamental section labelled \"Books called Apocrypha\", or just \"Apocrypha\" at the running page header. The KJV followed the Geneva Bible of 1560 almost exactly (variations are marked below). The section contains the following:\n1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\nTobit\nJudith (\"Judeth\" in Geneva)\nRest of Esther (Vulgate Esther 10:4-16:24)\nWisdom\nEcclesiasticus (also known as Sirach)\nBaruch and the Epistle of Jeremy (\"Jeremiah\" in Geneva) (all part of Vulgate Baruch)\nSong of the Three Children (Vulgate Daniel 3:24-90)\nStory of Susanna (Vulgate Daniel 13)\nThe Idol Bel and the Dragon (Vulgate Daniel 14)\nPrayer of Manasses (follows 2 Chronicles in Geneva)\n1 Maccabees\n2 Maccabees\nIncluded in this list are those books of the Clementine Vulgate that were not in Luther's canon. These are the books most frequently referred to by the casual appellation \"the Apocrypha\". These same books are also listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Despite being placed in the Apocrypha, in the table of lessons at the front of some printings of the King James Bible, these books are included under the Old Testament."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

      "label": "The New Living Translation was founded on the most recent scholarship in the theory of translation, with the goal of communicating the meaning of the ancient Bible texts as accurately as possible to the modern reader.\n\nIt seeks to preserve the freshness and readability of the original paraphrase while providing the accuracy and reliability of a translation prepared by a team of 90 biblical scholars.\n\nQuality of Translation:\n\nThe translators took on the challenge of producing a text that would have the same impact in the life of today's readers as the original text had for the original readers. The method employed to reach this goal in the New Living Translation, was to translate entire thoughts (instead of just words) into natural, everyday English. Therefore the NLT is a thought for thought, rather than word for word (literal) translation. As a result, it is easy to read and understand, while correctly conveying the original meaning of text."

      "label": "The Eth Cepher Abridged Edition is a robust application of our comprehensive restoration of sacred scripture in the English language, which has been reduced to the number of books (66) found in the traditional bibles of the twentieth century. This free download includes our search engine function also found in the paid app, and links the 3100 transliterated terms found in the Eth Cepher to a quick definition and pronunciation guide. Should you download the complete version of the Eth Cepher, you will enjoy all 87 books, including Chanok, Yovheliym, Yashar, 2 Baruk, and others, together with our notetaking, highlighting, and copying function, and our unique Lexicon, also incorporated into the App.  \n\nThe Hebrew word eth (את) means divine, and the Hebrew word cepher (ספר) means book, scroll, letter or writing. Hence, the את CEPHER is the “Divine Book”. This collection of sacred scripture restores much of what has been removed and/or incorrectly interpreted in the Bible for centuries!\n\n• Sets forth a translation, rather than a substitution of the names of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n• Transliterates over 3,100 other Hebrew names and places without substitution.\n• Omitted in other translations, the את has been restored over 10,000 times.\n• Corrects the errors (for the first time) in Shiyr HaShiriym (Song of Solomon), Yeshayahu (Isaiah) 14, Zakaryahu (Zechariah) 5, Mattithyahu (Matthew) 23, and corrects several other notorious errors found in virtually all previous English translations.\n• Restores the 29th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles chronicling Paul’s journey to Spain.\n\nThe Cepher App allows you to easily search the scriptures by keyword, book, chapter or verse and includes:\n\n• The Daily Hebrew Prayer.\n• Links to our Weekly Torah Portion, Dr. Stephen Pidgeon’s blog, articles and other free downloads available our website."

      "label": "This Application Helps Kids to learn some good lessons about good habits to follow in life. You can help your kids build their moral values by reading this moral stories in their formative years. These stories are written in simple English and improve their reading skills in a fun way. The app present a book story with moral massage for the children. Great stories for all kiddies out there.\n\nKids are so nice by constitution that they love to hear stories from their dad or mom or from their grandpa or grandma and even from their teachers. Some of the stories go by the name of Aesop whose contribution is great and whose identity is shredded with mystery. Some stories are successfully set inside the great epics of India and Rome. Some are still alive in the folktales which people of different regions have managed to preserve naturally. The great stores of moral stories are the religious texts. Parables of the Bible and stories of the Bhagvadgita are wonderful and intriguing as they are very simple and simultaneously effective for ever.\n\nOne more example is the story of the tortoise and the hare. Children always to support the cute little hare. The end of the story declaring that the tortoise has won makes them sad. Still the moral of the story is inserted in their growing mind in the most natural way. We do not find any reason to advise them to be slow and to be steady at the same time. They learn that they should be honest to their task and that they should stick to their task. In this story two known animals have been used who are examples of great contrast in respect of their movement. The story contains softness even in its twists and turns. Nothing happens under the sun as the tortoise moves slowly and as the hare takes some rest.\n\nMorality stories penetrate into the character of the kids. It is not important to order them 'do this' and 'do not do that' with a voice of an authority. They learn to obey the seniors and the importance of being industrious. We want to teach them 'loyalty' 'punctuality' and at times we get exhausted as the result is not achieved. Morality stories have the inherent strength to assist the children identifying what is right and what is wrong or what one should do and what one should not.\n\nKnowing how to teach kids about morals and get desirable results begins with you. Do you adhere to a set of moral values? How consistently do you act in accordance with those moral values? You will never teach kids about morals successfully if your personal behavior fails to agree with your teaching.\n\nTo begin, then, sit before a mirror and objectively evaluate your own behavior. If you want to teach kids about honesty, determine how honest you are. If you want to teach kids about morals such as respect and integrity, check your own levels of those traits. Be ruthless.\n\nThese are only some application books that are definitely worth adding into your library for your kids to enjoy. These books are also great as bedtime stories for kids looking for a different type of story outside of fairytales and other make-believe story. It's also great because it's not so in-your-face when it comes to the topic of moral. This privacy police for the app: http://gubrax.com/Appprivacypolicy.htm"

Any so-called “1611” King James Version you buy today at the local Christian Bookstore is absolutely NOT the 1611. .. it is the 1769 Baskerville Birmingham revision, even though it admits that nowhere, and may even say “1611” in the front… it’s just not true. Prepare to be shocked! The spellings have been revised, and some words changed, in almost every printing done since 1769, and fourteen entire books plus extra prefatory features have been removed from almost every printing done since 1885!\nThe 1611 King James Bible was writen more than four hundred years ago when the English language was different. The original 1611 A.D. text, written in Early Modern English, shows the language in closer association with its Latin roots. Spelling was in Jacobean style which was not entirely standardized, but could be read phonetically. The original typeface was in Gothic style. Although both the typestyle and the older language may be considered difficult to read by some 21st Century English readers, the King James Version is recognized and respected for its beauty, cadence, and poetic feel.\nEnglish spelling differences in John 3:16\n- U = V (Example: loued = loved; gauve = gave)\n- y with 'e' above it was used as represent the 'thorn' character, which means 'the') \n- nn (Sonne = Son)\nOther spelling differences\n- V = U (Example: vnto = unto | See John 1:11)\n- VV = W (Example: svvord = sword) [The V was called a 'U', this is why we still call a W a 'double U']\n- I = J (Example: Iesus = Jesus | See John 1:17)\n- Long \"s\" letters look similar to \"f\" letters (Notice the 'Old Testament' type example on the right)"

Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.\nJusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.\nLa Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues \"originelles\", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.\nLa version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux."

From their more than 30 years of experience in marriage counseling, Drs. Paul and Virginia Friesen provide a practical, biblically based app that can help you have the marriage you have always desired.\n\nThis app is a companion to the book “The Marriage App: Unlocking the Irony of Intimacy.\" The book and the app can be used together or independently.\n\nDrs. Paul and Virginia Friesen, founders of Home Improvement Ministries, have a passion for encouraging couples to find the joy and satisfaction that God designed for couples to experience in marriage. They each have a Doctorate in Marriage and Family Therapy from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. Paul and Virginia have three adult daughters and two sons-in-law, and are very proud grandparents. In addition to their ministry of speaking, writing, and counseling, they have ongoing relationships with various professional sports teams.  They are authors of ten books and four DVD series focusing on marriage relationships and parenting."

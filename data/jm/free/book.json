Kindle books you have purchased on Amazon will automatically appear in your app. Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime members can select and download Kindle books directly in the app.\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT GREAT READ\n• Read the books you buy on Amazon in the Kindle app. Choose from over six million Kindle books (including those with Audible narration), magazines, and comics and start reading in seconds. Explore Amazon Charts best sellers and titles across genres like romance, science fiction, children’s books, self-help, religion, nonfiction, and more—and try any book with a free sample straight from the Kindle app.\n\n• Kindle Unlimited members can enjoy unlimited reading and listening, with the freedom to explore over 1 million titles, thousands of audiobooks, and current magazines. \n\n• Over 1,000 books, magazines, comics, and more included with Amazon Prime.\n\n• Kindle Vella brings you stories released one short episode at a time.

Explore these reading features in the Kindle app:\n\n• Read your way. Customize your text size, font type, margins, text alignment, and orientation (portrait or landscape)—and choose whether to turn pages from left to right or continuously scroll. Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

      "label": "Readerly is an independent book discovery platform designed to help you track your reading, explore your stats, and discover something new. We’ve abandoned the sneaky algorithms and 5-star rating system to bring you book recs with more context.\n\nHere are a few things that make us different:\n\nNO 5-STAR RATINGS ON BOOKS\nWe built Readerly with the intention of moving away from the aggregate 5-star rating system. Reducing a book down to 3.3 or 4.2 stars doesn’t tell you what you as a reader with unique tastes will think of it. Instead, we provide context with every review, showing you how much your tastes overlap with the reviewer, books you’ve both read, and topics you both enjoy. This way, you can decide which reviews resonate with you, and discover books you might have otherwise passed over!\n\nPOPULAR BOOKS WON’T DOMINATE\nWhenever you take an action on a book—Save, Hide, or mark as Read—you’ll never see that book in your feed again. You can always find it in the corresponding tabs, but removing it allows us to make room for titles you may never have heard of or missed reading the first time around.\n\nREADERS LEAVE GISTS, NOT LONG REVIEWS\nWe’re replacing the traditional reader review with Gists. Gists are punchy, fun, easy-to-create slides that begin with a quick shoutline for your favorite books (just a sentence or two). You can add tags, character bios, favorite quotes, and similar books. You can also get creative with the “Read This…” slide, finishing the sentence however you like: “...if you’re in the mood for something light...on your commute...with a glass of pinot noir…” You get the idea. We only fill your feed with Gists from like-minded readers and people you follow so you can discover more books you’ll enjoy.\n\nWE’RE INDEPENDENT, ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO OUR READERS\nWe’re making book discovery better for readers and fairer for authors by challenging the ever-growing influence Amazon has over our reading choices. We care deeply about helping readers discover books and supporting the authors, publishers, and bookstores that bring us the stories we love. Readerly is free to use, but we offer a Readerly+ subscription to readers who want to support our mission so we can keep their interests at the heart of the platform.\n\nREADERLY+ BENEFITS:\nGet access to special, genre-specific Venn Groups, comprised of readers who share your taste in books.\nExplore your Venn Group’s top Gists and most helpful readers.\nCompare how people in your Venn Group rated a book vs. everyone else on Readerly.\nSee the most recommended books in each of your Venn Groups (your personalized top list!).\nCreate private groups with friends to post Gists and discuss books!\nBe the first to discover new titles as they’re released.\nCustomize how we calculate book ratings and who to include in your Venn Groups.\nSupport our mission to create a truly unique and independent book platform!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2022 Readerly, Inc.

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

      "label": "The Eth Cepher Abridged Edition is a robust application of our comprehensive restoration of sacred scripture in the English language, which has been reduced to the number of books (66) found in the traditional bibles of the twentieth century. This free download includes our search engine function also found in the paid app, and links the 3100 transliterated terms found in the Eth Cepher to a quick definition and pronunciation guide. Should you download the complete version of the Eth Cepher, you will enjoy all 87 books, including Chanok, Yovheliym, Yashar, 2 Baruk, and others, together with our notetaking, highlighting, and copying function, and our unique Lexicon, also incorporated into the App.  \n\nThe Hebrew word eth (את) means divine, and the Hebrew word cepher (ספר) means book, scroll, letter or writing. Hence, the את CEPHER is the “Divine Book”. This collection of sacred scripture restores much of what has been removed and/or incorrectly interpreted in the Bible for centuries!\n\n• Sets forth a translation, rather than a substitution of the names of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n• Transliterates over 3,100 other Hebrew names and places without substitution.\n• Omitted in other translations, the את has been restored over 10,000 times.\n• Corrects the errors (for the first time) in Shiyr HaShiriym (Song of Solomon), Yeshayahu (Isaiah) 14, Zakaryahu (Zechariah) 5, Mattithyahu (Matthew) 23, and corrects several other notorious errors found in virtually all previous English translations.\n• Restores the 29th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles chronicling Paul’s journey to Spain.\n\nThe Cepher App allows you to easily search the scriptures by keyword, book, chapter or verse and includes:\n\n• The Daily Hebrew Prayer.\n• Links to our Weekly Torah Portion, Dr. Stephen Pidgeon’s blog, articles and other free downloads available our website."

      "label": "Amharic Holy Bible. Ethiopia Bible\nAlthough Christianity became the state religion of Ethiopia in the 4th century, and the Bible was first translated into Ge'ez at about that time, only in the last two centuries have there appeared translations of the Bible into Amharic.\nIn 1962, a new Amharic translation from Ge'ez was printed, again with the patronage of the Emperor. The preface by Emperor Haile Selassie I is dated \"1955\" (E.C.), and the 31st year of his reign (i.e. AD 1962 in the Gregorian Calendar), and states that it was translated by the Bible Committee he convened between AD 1947 and 1952, \"realizing that there ought to be a revision from the original Hebrew and Greek of the existing translation of the Bible\". It included the 66 books of the protocanon (i.e. those held canonical in common with Protestant and Catholic Christians), as the 5 narrow canon deuterocanonical books were published separately. The five narrow canon Ethiopian deuterocanonical books comprise 1 Enoch (Henok; different from the standard editions of Ge'ez manuscripts A~Q by foreign academics), Jubilees (Ge'ez: Mets'hafe Kufale) and I, II, and III Meqabyan (substantially different from I, II, and III Maccabees)\nThe 81 book Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Bible, including the deuterocanonicals, 46 books of the Old Testament and 35 books of the New Testament, was published in 1986. This version incorporates a few minor changes or corrections to the 1962 Amharic text of the New Testament, but the text of the Old Testament and Deuterocanon are identical to those previously published under Haile Selassie I."

La versión francesa tuvo una revisión en 1973 y una edición en 1998. En español han salido ediciones y revisiones de la BJ en 1967, 1975, 1998 y 2009. La versión en español es impresa por la editorial Desclée de Brouwer (Bilbao).\nFuentes\nLa Escuela bíblica y arqueológica francesa de Jerusalén usó los textos originales en hebreo, arameo y griego para su versión en francés, en vez de la Vulgata de San Jerónimo. Para la versión en español, un equipo de traductores españoles emplearon también los escritos originales en hebreo, arameo y griego para el texto bíblico; mientras que la presentación, títulos, introducciones, notas y apéndices fueron traducidos de la versión francesa de la BJ.En las siguientes ediciones de la BJ en español se han incorporado novedades en las introducciones y notas como resultado de la actualización de la investigación bíblica."

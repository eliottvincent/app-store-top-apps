      "label": "Bible King James Version with Apocrypha\nThe King James Version (KJV), commonly known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin.\nThe Biblical apocrypha (from the Greek word aπόκρυφος, apókruphos, meaning \"hidden\") denotes the collection of ancient books found, in some editions of the Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments or as an appendix after the New Testament. Although the term apocrypha had been in use since the 5th century, it was in Luther's Bible of 1534 that the Apocrypha was first published as a separate intertestamental section. Luther was making a polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were not received as canonical. Although his statement was controversial in his day, Jerome was later titled a Doctor of the Church and his authority was also cited in the Anglican statement in 1571 of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nKing James Version\nThe English-language King James Version (KJV) of 1611 followed the lead of the Luther Bible in using an inter-testamental section labelled \"Books called Apocrypha\", or just \"Apocrypha\" at the running page header. The KJV followed the Geneva Bible of 1560 almost exactly (variations are marked below). The section contains the following:\n1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\nTobit\nJudith (\"Judeth\" in Geneva)\nRest of Esther (Vulgate Esther 10:4-16:24)\nWisdom\nEcclesiasticus (also known as Sirach)\nBaruch and the Epistle of Jeremy (\"Jeremiah\" in Geneva) (all part of Vulgate Baruch)\nSong of the Three Children (Vulgate Daniel 3:24-90)\nStory of Susanna (Vulgate Daniel 13)\nThe Idol Bel and the Dragon (Vulgate Daniel 14)\nPrayer of Manasses (follows 2 Chronicles in Geneva)\n1 Maccabees\n2 Maccabees\nIncluded in this list are those books of the Clementine Vulgate that were not in Luther's canon. These are the books most frequently referred to by the casual appellation \"the Apocrypha\". These same books are also listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Despite being placed in the Apocrypha, in the table of lessons at the front of some printings of the King James Bible, these books are included under the Old Testament."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

But his mother won't listen. She keeps setting him up on unsuccessful dates, leaving him frustrated. Kenna, Aidan's best friend, is a doctor who has never found time for love. She's always been busy with work, even to the extent she forgets about her personal life. Aiden and Kenna have known each other since they were kids, when a dramatic incident made them inseparable. As they grew older, things began to change, but they remain determined to stay best friends are forever . . . no matter the circumstances.

      "label": "The Noble Quran, also informally known as the Hilali-Khan translation\n\nInterpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an (1999) by Darussalam (first published 1977) is translated by Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali. This translation is among the most widely read translations in the world, primarily because it is the officially promoted translation of the Saudi Government.\n\nThis English translation was sponsored by the Saudi government and is provided free. It has been reported to be the most popular and \"Now the most widely disseminated Qur'an in most Islamic bookstores and Sunni mosques throughout the English-speaking world, this new translation is meant to replace the Yusuf 'Ali edition and comes with a seal of approval from both the University of Medina and the Saudi Dar al-Ifta. This venture utilizes mainstream classical sources of commentaries namely, Tabari, Qurtubi, and Ibn Kathir.\n\nAs with any translation of the original Arabic into another language, in this case English, this is an interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an (Word of God). The translation is heavily interspersed with commentaries and notes from At-Tabari, Al-Qurtubi and Ibn Kathir.\n\nMushin Khan completed the translation in twelve years, during which he consulted a number of English versions of the Qur'an but had found that they had ambiguity, shortcomings and dogmatic errors. So later, in association with Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali, he undertook the task of interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an providing evidences from the authentic sources for clarification.\n\nAbdul Malik Mujahid also said that Khan and Hilali behested that Darussalam Publishers and Distributors bring about a summarized edition in one volume:\n\"Its popularity among the readers encouraged them to prepare a comprehensive version of the interpretation of the meanings of the Qur'an in nine volumes comprising a number of Ahadith from Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim and other books with comments from Tafsir At-Tabd, Tafsir AI-Qurtubi and Tafsir Ibn Kathir, where necessary to elaborate upon the Qur'anic Verses.\"\n\nThe Quran is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (Arabic: الله‎, Allah). It is widely regarded as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language. Muslims consider the Quran to be the only book that has been protected by God from distortion or corruption. However, some significant textual variations (employing different wordings) and deficiencies in the Arabic script mean the relationship between the text of today's Quran and an original text is unclear. Quranic chapters are called suras and verses are called ayahs."

Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress.

Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip.

Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.\nJusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.\nLa Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues \"originelles\", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.\nLa version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

It is considered an apocryphal book as well as a part of the Pseudepigrapha (literally means “falsely ascribed” is a collection of works supposedly written by a biblical character), although it is not a part of the canonical Apocrypha.\n\nOnce considered to be of Christian origin because of its obvious references to Christ, ten fragments of The Book of Enoch have been found at Qumran in the Dead Sea Scrolls, it is known to have existed in its present form since at least the 2nd Century BC.\n\nThe book was believed to have been composed by Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. Most critics and scholars believe it was begun in the second century BC and was a collection of works that includes writings for the first century BC as well. Some believe it contains the actual words of Enoch and that it was handed down through the ages. There is no real way to know for certain if that is so. The only thing we know for certain is that fragments of the book date back to the 2nd century BC.\n\nIt is generally believed that the Apostles and the writers of the New Testament were fully aware of the Book of Enoch also called 1 Enoch. In fact, it is directly quoted in the Bible:\n\nJude 1:14-15 “And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, {15} To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him”"

      "label": "The Eth Cepher Abridged Edition is a robust application of our comprehensive restoration of sacred scripture in the English language, which has been reduced to the number of books (66) found in the traditional bibles of the twentieth century. This free download includes our search engine function also found in the paid app, and links the 3100 transliterated terms found in the Eth Cepher to a quick definition and pronunciation guide. Should you download the complete version of the Eth Cepher, you will enjoy all 87 books, including Chanok, Yovheliym, Yashar, 2 Baruk, and others, together with our notetaking, highlighting, and copying function, and our unique Lexicon, also incorporated into the App.  \n\nThe Hebrew word eth (את) means divine, and the Hebrew word cepher (ספר) means book, scroll, letter or writing. Hence, the את CEPHER is the “Divine Book”. This collection of sacred scripture restores much of what has been removed and/or incorrectly interpreted in the Bible for centuries!\n\n• Sets forth a translation, rather than a substitution of the names of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n• Transliterates over 3,100 other Hebrew names and places without substitution.\n• Omitted in other translations, the את has been restored over 10,000 times.\n• Corrects the errors (for the first time) in Shiyr HaShiriym (Song of Solomon), Yeshayahu (Isaiah) 14, Zakaryahu (Zechariah) 5, Mattithyahu (Matthew) 23, and corrects several other notorious errors found in virtually all previous English translations.\n• Restores the 29th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles chronicling Paul’s journey to Spain.\n\nThe Cepher App allows you to easily search the scriptures by keyword, book, chapter or verse and includes:\n\n• The Daily Hebrew Prayer.\n• Links to our Weekly Torah Portion, Dr. Stephen Pidgeon’s blog, articles and other free downloads available our website."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin.\nThe Biblical apocrypha (from the Greek word aπόκρυφος, apókruphos, meaning \"hidden\") denotes the collection of ancient books found, in some editions of the Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments or as an appendix after the New Testament. Although the term apocrypha had been in use since the 5th century, it was in Luther's Bible of 1534 that the Apocrypha was first published as a separate intertestamental section. Luther was making a polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were not received as canonical. Although his statement was controversial in his day, Jerome was later titled a Doctor of the Church and his authority was also cited in the Anglican statement in 1571 of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nKing James Version\nThe English-language King James Version (KJV) of 1611 followed the lead of the Luther Bible in using an inter-testamental section labelled \"Books called Apocrypha\", or just \"Apocrypha\" at the running page header. The KJV followed the Geneva Bible of 1560 almost exactly (variations are marked below). The section contains the following:\n1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\nTobit\nJudith (\"Judeth\" in Geneva)\nRest of Esther (Vulgate Esther 10:4-16:24)\nWisdom\nEcclesiasticus (also known as Sirach)\nBaruch and the Epistle of Jeremy (\"Jeremiah\" in Geneva) (all part of Vulgate Baruch)\nSong of the Three Children (Vulgate Daniel 3:24-90)\nStory of Susanna (Vulgate Daniel 13)\nThe Idol Bel and the Dragon (Vulgate Daniel 14)\nPrayer of Manasses (follows 2 Chronicles in Geneva)\n1 Maccabees\n2 Maccabees\nIncluded in this list are those books of the Clementine Vulgate that were not in Luther's canon. These are the books most frequently referred to by the casual appellation \"the Apocrypha\". These same books are also listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Despite being placed in the Apocrypha, in the table of lessons at the front of some printings of the King James Bible, these books are included under the Old Testament."

      "label": "Bible en français Louis Segond (Traduction King James Version - KJV) Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament.\nAussi je vous recommande \"Concordance Biblique\" - vous trouver dans mes applications.\nAprès la mort de Segond, la Société biblique britannique et étrangère révise la traduction, en 1910, en choisissant d'autres termes doctrinaux plus conformes à la pensée protestante orthodoxe (par exemple : « sacrificateurs » à la place de « prêtres », « foi » à la place de « fidélité »)6. Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.\nJusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.\nLa Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues \"originelles\", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.\nLa version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux."

The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants.

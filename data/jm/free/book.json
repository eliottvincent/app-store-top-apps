Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress.

Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip.

Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

      "label": "Unlike other techniques, you do not need to \"reprogram\" your brain with various Schulte tables, memory training, vocabulary development, memorizing numbers, etc. Reading speed increases due to the lack of eye movement and focusing of vision in one place. You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 400 years. The King James Version present on the Bible Gateway matches the 1987 printing.

This free download includes our search engine function also found in the paid app, and links the 3100 transliterated terms found in the Eth Cepher to a quick definition and pronunciation guide. Should you download the complete version of the Eth Cepher, you will enjoy all 87 books, including Chanok, Yovheliym, Yashar, 2 Baruk, and others, together with our notetaking, highlighting, and copying function, and our unique Lexicon, also incorporated into the App.  \n\nThe Hebrew word eth (את) means divine, and the Hebrew word cepher (ספר) means book, scroll, letter or writing. Hence, the את CEPHER is the “Divine Book”. This collection of sacred scripture restores much of what has been removed and/or incorrectly interpreted in the Bible for centuries!\n\n• Sets forth a translation, rather than a substitution of the names of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n• Transliterates over 3,100 other Hebrew names and places without substitution.\n• Omitted in other translations, the את has been restored over 10,000 times.\n• Corrects the errors (for the first time) in Shiyr HaShiriym (Song of Solomon), Yeshayahu (Isaiah) 14, Zakaryahu (Zechariah) 5, Mattithyahu (Matthew) 23, and corrects several other notorious errors found in virtually all previous English translations.\n• Restores the 29th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles chronicling Paul’s journey to Spain.\n\nThe Cepher App allows you to easily search the scriptures by keyword, book, chapter or verse and includes:\n\n• The Daily Hebrew Prayer.\n• Links to our Weekly Torah Portion, Dr. Stephen Pidgeon’s blog, articles and other free downloads available our website."

      "label": "Bible King James Version with Apocrypha\nThe King James Version (KJV), commonly known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin.\nThe Biblical apocrypha (from the Greek word aπόκρυφος, apókruphos, meaning \"hidden\") denotes the collection of ancient books found, in some editions of the Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments or as an appendix after the New Testament. Although the term apocrypha had been in use since the 5th century, it was in Luther's Bible of 1534 that the Apocrypha was first published as a separate intertestamental section. Luther was making a polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were not received as canonical. Although his statement was controversial in his day, Jerome was later titled a Doctor of the Church and his authority was also cited in the Anglican statement in 1571 of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nKing James Version\nThe English-language King James Version (KJV) of 1611 followed the lead of the Luther Bible in using an inter-testamental section labelled \"Books called Apocrypha\", or just \"Apocrypha\" at the running page header. The KJV followed the Geneva Bible of 1560 almost exactly (variations are marked below). The section contains the following:\n1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\nTobit\nJudith (\"Judeth\" in Geneva)\nRest of Esther (Vulgate Esther 10:4-16:24)\nWisdom\nEcclesiasticus (also known as Sirach)\nBaruch and the Epistle of Jeremy (\"Jeremiah\" in Geneva) (all part of Vulgate Baruch)\nSong of the Three Children (Vulgate Daniel 3:24-90)\nStory of Susanna (Vulgate Daniel 13)\nThe Idol Bel and the Dragon (Vulgate Daniel 14)\nPrayer of Manasses (follows 2 Chronicles in Geneva)\n1 Maccabees\n2 Maccabees\nIncluded in this list are those books of the Clementine Vulgate that were not in Luther's canon. These are the books most frequently referred to by the casual appellation \"the Apocrypha\". These same books are also listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Despite being placed in the Apocrypha, in the table of lessons at the front of some printings of the King James Bible, these books are included under the Old Testament."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

Enoch contains unique material on the origins of demons and Nephilim, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why the Genesis flood was morally necessary, and prophetic exposition of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah.\n\nThe Book of Jubilees claims to present \"the history of the division of the days of the Law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the jubilees of the world\" as revealed to Moses (in addition to the Torah or \"Instruction\") by angels while he was on Mount Sinai for forty days and forty nights. The chronology given in Jubilees is based on multiples of seven; the jubilees are periods of 49 years (seven \"year-weeks\"), into which all of time has been divided.\n\nThe Book of Jasher, which means the Book of the Upright or the Book of the Just Man, is a book mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, often interpreted as a lost non-canonical book.\n\nThe Apocrypha is a selection of books which were published in the original 1611 King James Bible (KJV). These apocryphal books were positioned between the Old and New Testament (it also contained maps and geneologies). The apocrypha was a part of the KJV for 274 years until being removed in 1885 A.D. A portion of these books were called deuterocanonical books by some entities, such as the Catholic church.\n\nThe 70 missing verses in 2 Esdras are not part of the King James Version Apocrypha, but are revealed in the Cambridge Annotated Study Apocrypha -edited by: Howard C. Kee. These verses are also available in the NRSV Holy Bible with the Apocrypha-by Oxford University Press.\n\nApocrypha / Deuterocanonical: Bible's Lost Books includes these books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, and Laodiceans.\n\nThe King James Version (KJV 1611) are included.\nWith more than 20 English translations of the Bible currently available, the King James Version (1611) is still considered by many scholars to be the most influential and popular version. In 1604, King James I of England authorized the re-translation of the Bible into English.\n\nThank you for using the Books of Jubilees, Jasher, Enoch app."

      "label": "The Noble Quran, also informally known as the Hilali-Khan translation\n\nInterpretation of the Meanings of the Noble Qur'an (1999) by Darussalam (first published 1977) is translated by Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali. This translation is among the most widely read translations in the world, primarily because it is the officially promoted translation of the Saudi Government.\n\nThis English translation was sponsored by the Saudi government and is provided free. It has been reported to be the most popular and \"Now the most widely disseminated Qur'an in most Islamic bookstores and Sunni mosques throughout the English-speaking world, this new translation is meant to replace the Yusuf 'Ali edition and comes with a seal of approval from both the University of Medina and the Saudi Dar al-Ifta. This venture utilizes mainstream classical sources of commentaries namely, Tabari, Qurtubi, and Ibn Kathir.\n\nAs with any translation of the original Arabic into another language, in this case English, this is an interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an (Word of God). The translation is heavily interspersed with commentaries and notes from At-Tabari, Al-Qurtubi and Ibn Kathir.\n\nMushin Khan completed the translation in twelve years, during which he consulted a number of English versions of the Qur'an but had found that they had ambiguity, shortcomings and dogmatic errors. So later, in association with Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali, he undertook the task of interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Qur'an providing evidences from the authentic sources for clarification.\n\nAbdul Malik Mujahid also said that Khan and Hilali behested that Darussalam Publishers and Distributors bring about a summarized edition in one volume:\n\"Its popularity among the readers encouraged them to prepare a comprehensive version of the interpretation of the meanings of the Qur'an in nine volumes comprising a number of Ahadith from Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim and other books with comments from Tafsir At-Tabd, Tafsir AI-Qurtubi and Tafsir Ibn Kathir, where necessary to elaborate upon the Qur'anic Verses.\"\n\nThe Quran is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (Arabic: الله‎, Allah). It is widely regarded as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language. Muslims consider the Quran to be the only book that has been protected by God from distortion or corruption. However, some significant textual variations (employing different wordings) and deficiencies in the Arabic script mean the relationship between the text of today's Quran and an original text is unclear. Quranic chapters are called suras and verses are called ayahs."

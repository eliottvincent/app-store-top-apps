That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

With a single tap, track and save your time with Toggl Track — anywhere you go.\n\nOr maybe you don't really want to use the pesky phone keyboard — we get it. That's why you can now use Siri to track your time with Toggl Track, no keyboard is needed.\n\nToggl Track also has you covered across all of your devices. Start tracking your hours in a browser, then stop it later on your phone or on your Apple Watch with our brand new watchOS app. All your tracked time is safely synced between your iPhone, Watch, desktop, and browser (if you want more of a Pomodoro timer experience).\n\nFEATURES:\n• Pomodoro mode\nEnjoy better focus and productivity by trying out the Pomodoro technique with our brand new Pomodoro mode. The idea behind the Pomodoro technique is that you can work more effectively when you work in timed, 25-minute increments (with breaks in between). Our built-in timer automatically tracks your time in 25-minute increments, with notifications, a full screen mode, and countdown timer to really help you stay focused and on task.\n\n• Reports\nDiscover what's taking up your time and get a snapshot of your day or week with Reports. Analyze your Reports in the app or export them to send the data to your clients (or analyze them further on our web app to see where your hours are going).\n\n• Sync\nKeeps your time seamlessly synced, safely saved, and ready to track on your account, on any device.\n\n• Calendar\nConnect your calendar app to Toggl Track to see all of your calendar events and time entries in the app itself (in the same view), receive notifications before the events start, and most importantly, instantly create time entries based on your calendar events!\n\n• Customize your time entries with projects, clients, and tags\nOrganize and add more details to your time entries by adding meta data on projects, clients, and tags. See exactly where your work hours are going and adjust your schedule and routines accordingly.\n\n• Siri\nToggl Track is compatible with Siri! Start a new time entry, stop it, or access your reports — all that with just a few words.\n\n• iOS Widgets\nStart (and stop) tracking from your iPhone Home Screen.\n\n• Apple Sign-in\nYou can now also sign into our Toggl Track app via your Apple ID.\n\n• Suggestions\nThe more you track, the better the data. The app will give you suggested time entries based on your tracking habits and previous time entries.\n\n• Shortcuts\nUse @ and # to quickly add projects and tags to your time entry and get back to work right away!\n\n• Auto-complete\nEasily find your older time entries and start tracking time on them again.\n\n• Manual Mode\nWant more control? Add and edit all of your time manually and make sure that every second of your time is accounted for. This feature is optional and it's accessible from the Settings menu.\n\n-----\n\n- But what if I'm offline?\nNo problem! You can still track your time through the app, and once you're back online, it will sync seamlessly with your account (and the rest of your devices). Your time is not going anywhere.\n\n- Is the app free?\nYes, Toggl Track on iOS is completely free for you to use.\n\n- Can I send you some feedback?\nYou betcha (and we'd love to hear from you)! You can send us feedback directly from the app. Just look for “Submit Feedback” in the Settings menu.\n\nYep, that's Toggl Track — a time tracking app so simple that you'll actually use it and get stuff done! See where your time goes, focus on important tasks, and boost your productivity. Whether you’re in an office or en route to one, stuck on a space mission to Mars, or just want to see how much time you're wasting on projects that aren't bringing you money — track your time anywhere you go."

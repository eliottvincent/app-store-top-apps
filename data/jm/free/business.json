The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

He describes one of his pickup experiences below: “While picking up two diffusers, one customer noticed that our store smelled great and asked what product we were using. On top of their Wish Pickup order, they ended up buying 6 items including the scent sachets we use in our store, essential oils for the Wish diffusers, and some items that were near checkout!”\n\nReach new users\nFrom Miami to Berlin to Paris, Wish has millions of users all around the world. Gain new customers near your area.\n\nPartner with Wish Local to grow your business.\nJoining is easy and free!

Users can engage face to face with a virtual receptionist anywhere an in-person receptionist could be - at the office front desk, hotel lobby, or other location.

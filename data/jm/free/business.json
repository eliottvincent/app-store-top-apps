The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

      "label": "The best drone maps and models come from the best drone flights. Automate aerial mapping with your DJI drone and get high-resolution maps and 3D models in minutes.\n\nFrom takeoff to landing, the Skycatch drone flight app will autonomously fly your DJI drone and perfectly capture photos for 3D mapping. \n\nUse with the latest DJI drones:\n* DJI Phantom 3 Advanced / Pro \n* Phantom 4 / Pro\n* Inspire 1 / Pro\n\n\"Using Skycatch tools helps increase field productivity related to material staging and site logistics by up to 3 hours per week.” — Scott W, DPR Construction\n\nHow it works:\n1. Outline the area you want to map. \n2. Tap TAKEOFF to send your mission to your drone. Drone will complete mission autonomously. \n3. Upload photos from your drone’s SD card to https://upload.skycatch.com and Skycatch photogrammetry will automatically cloud process into aerial maps and 3D models.\n\n\nIt’s that easy! Now you can view and share your processed data online and even markup, measure, overlay BIM & CAD files, and more.\n\n\nKey features:\n- In-app guidance plus quick access to tutorials, help docs, and chat support.\n- Select the resolution you want and the app automatically calculates waypoints, altitude, speed, and overlap.\n- Flight direction control: change the direction/heading of flight path depending on wind, terrain, and obstacles.\n- Multi-flight missions: plan your entire flight once and if you need to replace your battery mid-flight just hit ‘Continue’ to pick up right where you left off.\n- Save mission plans without having to re-plan  — perfect for multiple sites and recurring data capture.\n- Watch live video feed of your drone's flight right in the app."

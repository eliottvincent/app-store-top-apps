During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

      "label": "Calabrio WFM MyTime requires iOS 12.3 or later. \n\nCalabrio WFM MyTime is a fully functional interactive application, allowing users of the Calabrio WFM solution to view and manage their work schedules. The Calabrio WFM MyTime app is compatible with Cloud and On-Premise installations, to allow users to check and manage their schedules from anywhere at any time.  \n\nUsers can view their schedule day by day, week by week or month by month. Using clear and simple pages, users can clearly see all activities during a day, when they are scheduled for lunch, what time they finish, what overtime they are working. It’s also possible to view team members’ schedules, allowing easy coordination for meetings and other activities.\n\nUsers can easily notify any absence due to sickness, request vacation, and check the status of a request. Advanced, but simple to use features, also include the setting of availability and shift trades. Setting availability is a great feature for many agents, but especially for part time workers such as students, who need to be able to vary their work times. Through a powerful shift trading functionality users can quickly adapt working times with colleagues to suit their own lifestyle, all with a few simple finger touches. A great feature for agents, and a huge time saver for their supervisors. Naturally notifications and messages can be viewed so you can quickly know of any changes.\n\nPlease Note: A customer’s IT department must allow agents to have access to MyTime from the Internet before this app may be used."

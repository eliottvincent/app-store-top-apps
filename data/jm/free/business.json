Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

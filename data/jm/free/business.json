He describes one of his pickup experiences below: “While picking up two diffusers, one customer noticed that our store smelled great and asked what product we were using. On top of their Wish Pickup order, they ended up buying 6 items including the scent sachets we use in our store, essential oils for the Wish diffusers, and some items that were near checkout!”\n\nReach new users\nFrom Miami to Berlin to Paris, Wish has millions of users all around the world.

Thus, you can easily identify if any of them are foreign. So you’ll know when it’s time to change your Wi-Fi password or talk to your neighbor :)\n\nWiFi Guard can scan your networks automatically and send notifications about new devices.

Thanks guys\n\t—by Metadona2007, United States\n\nApp works great, your able to get notices and see when new devices access the network your on. You can even block the device. Hey, if your kids are suppose to be off line at a certain time and connect after cut off then block their wireless device when your notified they tried to get back on.\n\t—by Tim, United States\n\nThus shows me every device on my network. I have it setup to notify me when a new device grabs an IP address.\n\t—by fbara, United States\n\nJust a simple little app that does what it promises. . . In less time than it takes to find the installed app (uh, yeah, I have a few more pages than the factory install!) it shows you all you need to know. I didn't think it would matter that much to me, but I was curiously relieved to see I was hacker-free! And no useless, memory-wasting \"bells and whistles\" to bloat it up. To address a previous review concern, I don't think the app can provide any more information than what the connected device is \"pinging;\" if I wasn't ...\n\t—by Saintsinger, United States\n\nGives me peace of mind to see what devices are connected\n\t—by Sctty7, United States"

With CA Mobile OTP, you use your mobile device to generate a passcode that can be used to verify a MasterCard or Visa electronic payment transaction, or to login to an online account. This app supports EMV standards when generating the passcode for authenticating MasterCard and Visa online payment transactions. CA Mobile OTP also supports HOTP standards for generating one-time passcodes to use when authenticating to Web portals and VPNs. \n\nHow does it work?\n\nYour card issuer, for example, your bank or the organization where you have an online account, must use the CA Technologies authentication solution. You must sign up for the additional security with them. They will give you a link to download the account onto your device, along with your userid and an activation code. You will run the CA Mobile OTP app on your device and enter the information provided by the organization to activate OTP authentication with this organization. You then choose a personal PIN that will be used to generate an OTP for this account. The OTP can be generated without a connection to your mobile network allowing you to authenticate any time, anywhere using the one-time passcode generated on your device. When you are prompted to authenticate to your online account or to provide a passcode to shop online, you simply run the CA Mobile OTP app, enter your personal PIN, and an OTP is displayed on the device. You then enter the OTP into the application prompt to authenticate your e-payment transaction or to login to your account."

      "label": "Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational app to help your toddler learn phonics and trace letters of the alphabet? Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

The app was not only created for students, but by students as well. We understand the true needs of students in their daily school lives and have therefore created an intuitive design which means you'll always stay on top of your work throughout the year and never miss another deadline.\n\nKEEP TRACK OF YOUR ENTIRE SCHOOL SCHEDULE\n\nThe timetable is quick and easy to setup. It has an intuitive design to display your lessons for the week allowing you to efficiently plan your days in advance. To accommodate all schedules we now have an option to make your timetable 2 weeks long.\n\nTAKE NOTE OF ALL IMPORTANT EVENTS/MEETINGS AND CLUBS\n\nNever miss an event again through the use of the event planner. Plan and stay on top of all your school events, commitments and responsibilities. Set reminders to make sure you are always on time where you need to be.\n\nNEVER FORGET ANOTHER HOMEWORK OR ASSIGNMENT\n\nOur easy to use, modern homework diary means you'll always stay on top of your work throughout the year and complete your homework on time. Each entry provides the ability to select the type of homework, teacher its due for, space for extra detail and more. Set notifications for each homework to remind you exactly when the homework is due.\n\nMAKE REMINDERS OF ALL YOUR REQUIRED TASKS/WORK EVEN OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL\n\nClassify is here to help you organise your life, not just your academics. The Tasks feature is designed to allow you to input anything you need to complete and sort it by its urgency, giving you the ability to prioritise and compartmentalise all your work.\n\nVIEW ALL ASPECTS OF YOUR SCHOOL ORGANISATION WITH EASE IN ONE PLACE\n\nThe homepage brings together all parts of the app seamlessly. The page is split in two with a \"week\" tab to show you your most immediate incomplete assignments and an \"month\" tab which displays your entire academic calendar, giving you ultimate flexibility in making future plans and knowing all upcoming deadlines.Do you often forget to write down your homework's, and find yourself always asking friends for help? Do you want to find a digital version of your school planner or your homework diary? Do you want to become more organised at school and stay ahead instead of falling behind with assignments and meetings? We designed the Classify app to help students address these types of challenges using our own school experiences to create an app which has all your organisational needs in one place.Visit classify.org.uk to find out more about our app and privacy policy.\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback @classifyapp on Twitter and Instagram."

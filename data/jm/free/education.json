      "label": "Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational app to help your toddler learn phonics and trace letters of the alphabet? Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

RANKED #1 APP FOR KIDS on APP Store in many countries. \n\nLet's come and play with me! \nThis new user-friendly wonderful Abby's Magic Laptop for Preschool and Toddlers welcomes you to the colorful world of exploration and learning! This adorable learn and play laptop teaches children letters, numbers, colors, shapes, animals, toys, fruits, musical instruments, and more. Kids will love switching between categories. Actions lead to learning!\n\nThe application offers you in total the possibility of choosing from 12(!) thematic categories. Children will be thrilled to play with this laptop and learn new things.  The numerous buttons the laptop offers invite exploration and enable children to determine their own pace of learning according to their individual needs.\n\nThe laptop includes two game modes: 'Let's Play!' and 'Let's Learn!' The switching between the modes is made easy by two large red buttons. Children typically do not experience problems learning to activate these two modes, but in case they do, we encourage parents to switch the mode\nfor their children.\n\n*Let's Play!*\nThe 'Let's Play!' mode is designed primarily for children unfamiliar with the objects included, or those who want to refresh and enhance their knowledge of the already acquired vocabulary. To activate the mode, simply press the 'Let's play!' button,  and choose a desired thematic category from one of the blue buttons in the upper half of the gaming space. For instance, after pressing a blue button with a picture of a ball, there are going to appear buttons with toys theme on the lower half of the gaming screen. When pressing the individual picture buttons then, the pictures are going to appear enlarged on the laptop monitor, the pronounced name and the written form of the word as well as its authentic sound and small animation follows afterwards.\n\n*Let's Learn!*\nDo you want some practice too? Don't forget to try the 'Let's Learn!' mode! To activate this mode, tap on the 'Let's Learn' button. Afterwards, choose one of the twelve thematic categories and let the challenge begin! When the category has been selected, an enthusiastic monkey Abby appears on the laptop monitor and gives tasks to a child. The task is always to select the picture of the correct item that she pronounced. Of course, after each correct answer, the cute monkey provides words of praise and\nencouragement.\n\nTo make the laptop more engaging, we also included four colorful buttons in the lower half of the game screen. These simulate the functions of a videophone and include such funny effects such as entertaining sound effects and melodies.\n\nThank you for selecting our app! We sincerely hope your children will enjoy it!\n\nYour 22learn team!"

This allows you to quickly learn new words and grow your English vocabulary whilst also reinforcing the meaning of words that you already know.\n\nThe selected words are based on their frequency in the English language in its everyday use, meaning that you are learning words that you don’t know while still being able to use these words every day - there would be no point in learning words you would never use, see or hear!\n\nAfter downloading the app, you will be able to enjoy the many features WordPal has to offer for free:\n- Pick the synonym of the word given from multiple choice\n- See the word’s definition(s) to help you better understand the word\n- See an example for each definition to show the word in context\n- Access your progress at any time to get a feel for how you are doing; get regular updates of your progress while learning to show how you are improving your vocabulary\n- 5 progress levels are used: mastered, nearly mastered, getting there, keep trying and work needed — this helps to see how well you know each word\n- Sleek, clean design\n- Set a daily goal to help keep you on track and set up notification reminders for specific times of the day, allowing you to improve your vocabulary every day and learn new words rapidly through spaced repetition\n- Build up a streak (the number of consecutive days you have achieved your daily goal)\n- Extremely intuitive and simple to use\n\nA premium version (WordPal Premium Subscription) is available through subscription which includes more words, games, and the ability to bookmark words.\n\n\nPicking the correct synonym is a very useful method for growing your vocabulary quickly:\n- Firstly, it makes it easier for you to use more advanced words when you speak or write. If you wanted to find a better word for something, you would look in a thesaurus (a thesaurus shows synonyms for words), but if you know a synonym for each word you learn in the app, you will find it easier to replace that synonym with the more advanced vocabulary word in everyday speech and writing.\n- Secondly, knowing a synonym serves as a trigger word in your memory to help you remember the general meaning of each word - having this trigger word makes it easier to remember the definitions and examples you have seen in our app when you see or hear a word.\n\n\nWhy do our users love our app?\n- It’s a fun approach that we developed to help users learn English vocabulary - it turns it into a game!\n- It sparks rapid growth in users’ vocabulary as a result of our special algorithm\n- It’s so easy to use with the intuitive, simple interface\n- It’s so easy to understand our definitions and examples\n- It’s so easy to track your progress\n\nThe app may be useful in preparation for many exams where a strong vocabulary helps, such as GCSE English, A-level English, SAT, GRE, IELTS, TOEFL, ESL, ACT, GMAT, MAT, CAT, SSC, IBPS PO, Bank Clerk, RRB, SBI, USPC, IAS, NDA, AFCAT and other college admissions tests, placement exams, recruitment tests and aptitude tests.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/42679425\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.iubenda.com/terms-and-conditions/42679425"

      "label": "Kindergarten Phonics Videos & Games for Level 1: \nIn this app, children will focus on the short vowel sounds (a, e, i, o, u). Special attention will be given to short 'a' & 'e'. \n\nThis is only the free version, which is meant to give you a taste of what is in the full app. In the full app, they will learn to blend and read words from the word families at, an, am, ap, ack,  en, et & est. The app introduces key beginning consonant sounds which are also important in learning to read words and sentences. This is the first step in learning to blend and read words and sentences. There are decodable video stories which are meant to help learners see the use of these word families in sentences while inexplicitly introducing a few high frequency sight words. The videos and games are part of our Kindergarten Level 1 phonics program on http://www.kizphonics.com/phonics-program/kindergarten-level-1/\nThis app works great with our KIZ PHONICS BOOK 2 for Kindergarten Level1. It is a great complementary product.\n\nVIDEOS: First, children will watch and learn words with the beginning and middle short vowel sounds a, e, i, o, u in 5 videos. Then they will focus on word families ack, am, an, at, ap, et, en, est in another 6 videos. These word families videos will show them how words are blended and read. Then there are 16 other videos which focus on beginning consonants b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, t, v, w. \nThere are 3 short stories aimed at extending practice of short 'a' & 'e' with related word families.\n\nGAMES: Every video is accompanied by a drag and drop activity or two to help practice what was taught in the videos. These games will ensure that learners have enough practice to learn and master the core concepts of this level. At the end, your child will be blending consonants and vowel word families to read simple words like cat, cap, back, sat, map, vet, pet, wet, ten etc. \nThe app furthers the development of early reading skills based on the proven methods of phonics. \nReading specialists were behind the development of the app, making sure pronunciation of letter sounds were accurate. You will hear the letter sounds as they are supposed to be in a natural native English accent.  A good beginning is essential at this stage."

Most Seventh-Day Adventist churches teach on the same topic or reading in a given week, as each quarter of the year has a different theme that reflects Bible, doctrinal, or church lifestyle teachings. Thus the lesson booklet is called quarterly.\r\nThis app provides you with all of the Sabbath School quarterlies for the current and previous three quarters. It lets you take notes, and it remembers the notes for later when you are taking part in the discussion during Sabbath school. The app allows you to hone in on the specific week and day of study and enables you to move from one day to another with a tap or swipe of your finger.\r\n\r\nThe SDA Sabbath School Quarterly App is an independent ministry that supports the mission of the Seventh-day Adventist® Church; however, it is not part of, affiliated with, or supported by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists® headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland or any of its affiliates known as the Seventh-day Adventist ® Church.

      "label": "If you are like us, parents with young children at home, we sometimes struggle with boredom reading the same stories over and over again.  \n\nThis is why we created a fun reading experience to help break the monotony of reading One Fish, Two Fish for the 50th time. \n\nReading Roo will turn any page from a book or text based document (like worksheets) into a fun interactive activity.  Parents will simply scan and digitize the text, kids can tap on the text, and  the app will magically read the words aloud while highlighting the text.\n\nFor an immersive experience, you and your child can record yourselves reading the story and personalize the read aloud with your own inflection and tone.  Listen to your voiceover and watch your kids beam with excitement as they hear your voices spoken out loud.  This will generate so much enthusiasm for reading, they will beg you to scan more pages.\n\nReading Roo is a fun family activity.  Parents can use it to reconnect with their favorite childhood stories and bring them to life.  Share those classics with your children and create new memorable reading experiences together.\n\nRECORD YOUR VOICE \nAnyone can record a narration.  Great for traveling parents, aunts/uncles and grandparents who want to be part of a child’s reading activities. \n\n\nBUILD CONFIDENCE \nBuild your child’s confidence by encouraging independent reading and exploring.  Let them narrate a passage or story, independently flip through pages, set their own pace, and read along with the highlighted text.  \n\nREADING ASSESSMENT \nA built-in reading assessment helps take a snapshot of the child’s reading capabilities.  This is an opportunity for parents and guardians to monitor the child's reading proficiency, completeness and fluency and offer help in areas that need improvement.\n\nSAFE ZONE \nReading Roo is a no ad, no social distractions zone.  Kids can focus on having fun reading.\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR ACCESS TO PRO FEATURES:\n• More page scans\n• Record Voiceover\n• Reading Assessment\n• Get unlimited access to upcoming features\n\nABOUT SUBSCRIPTIONS: \n• Subscriptions are billed monthly at the rate selected depending on the subscription plan.\n• Subscription auto-renew at the cost of the selected plan, unless cancelled 24-hours in advance prior to the end of the current period.

You'll always have Mendeleev's Periodic Table and Solubility table handy. And even the calculator of molar masses!\n\nThe app can find the equations of chemical reactions even if the right or left part is unknown, it helps you with organic and inorganic chemistry. The discovered reactions will be displayed in a usual and ionic form. Organic chemistry formulas are drawn as images by the app.\n\nConvenient interactive Periodic Table. Tap a chemical element in the table to find more information about it. Use a search button to find an element by name or symbol.\n\nThe calculator of molar masses. Enter a chemical compound correctly and it will show molar masses and percentages of elements.\n\nThe table of solubility of substances is added in the app as well as Acid strength chart. Now your textbooks become waste!\n\nThe best solver of chemical equations for iPhone and iPad.\n\nAdd new shiny Widgets to the desktop and learn information about chemical elements from Periodic Table subconsciously. It's a fun way to learn and remember chemical elements data.\n\nAll these tables and charts are available in the free Chemistry app:\n* Periodic table\n* Atoms in Augmented Reality\n* Chemical reactions search\n* Offline access to information about chemical elements\n* Solubility table\n* Molar mass calculator\n* Electronegativity of elements\n* Molecular weights of organic substances\n* Reactivity series\n* Acid strengths chart\n* Acids, anions, salts list\n* Standard electrode potential\n* Widgets to easily remember the periodic table and chemical elements\n\nThe chemistry falls into to number of the most important sciences and is one of the main school objects. Its studying begins with the Periodic Table. Interactive approach to a training material is more effective than classical. As in it technologies which became the family for the modern pupils are used.\n\nThe periodic table of elements is one of the most important tools in chemistry. The periodic table is essential for understanding the structure and behavior of atoms and molecules. It also provides a useful framework for predicting the properties of new and unknown elements.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of Use: http://getchemistry.io/terms-and-conditions/ios/\nPrivacy policy: http://getchemistry.io/privacy-policy/ios/"

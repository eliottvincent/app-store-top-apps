Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Most Seventh-Day Adventist churches teach on the same topic or reading in a given week, as each quarter of the year has a different theme that reflects Bible, doctrinal, or church lifestyle teachings. Thus the lesson booklet is called quarterly.\r\nThis app provides you with all of the Sabbath School quarterlies for the current and previous three quarters. It lets you take notes, and it remembers the notes for later when you are taking part in the discussion during Sabbath school.

      "label": "iNaturalist is a social network for sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. The primary goal is to connect people to nature, and the secondary goal is to generate scientifically valuable biodiversity data from these personal encounters. \n\niNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals with visually similar suggestions and verification by dedicated contributors. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you'll create research-quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n• Identification suggestions: Take or import a photo and view the top 10 most visually similar species matches and tap through to get more information. You can view these suggestions even before creating an account.\n• Feedback from our community: Create an account to share your observations and start a conversation about what you saw. Can’t identify the organism? Start with a broad identification like “plants” or “fungi” so others with more expertise can find it and refine the identification. \n• Keep a record of all living things: Build your life list by posting to iNaturalist. Where, when, and what you saw is the basis of each observation you create.\n• Grounded in science: Every identification is connected to the tree of life, which means you can search for broad classifications like “Ferns” or “Fungi” as well as species-level identifications like “Humpback Whale” (and everything in between). \n• Advancing science & conservation: Millions of observations created and identified by the iNaturalist community are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility where they are used to advance scientific understanding of biodiversity through open data and open science. \n• Enabling citizen science and community science: Join any of the tens of thousands of projects around the world on iNaturalist to draw attention to and collect data about particular species or places.\n• Not-for-profit: iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, both 501(c)3 nonprofits in the United States. iNaturalist is free for anyone to use thanks to the generous support of many organizations and individuals. Thank you!\n• No hidden charges: This app is truly free because we believe nature is for everyone.\n• Best for wild plants and animals: The iNaturalist community is better at identifying wild plants and animals than those in gardens or horticulture. Get outside and find what’s wild!\n• Control how your location is shared: Set the privacy to obscured (only general location is shared) or private (no location is shared at all, but much harder for others to help identify). The locations of species at risk from disturbance are automatically obscured.\n• More than a mobile app: iNaturalist has even more extensive features and tools for learning and exploration. Get the full experience at inaturalist.org!\n• 35+ languages: iNaturalist has been translated into dozens of languages thanks to multilingual enthusiasts who want to see the community grow.\n• A global network: iNaturalist is used in every country on earth! In many countries, we have formal agreements with local organizations to promote iNaturalist. Use this app for contributing to all iNaturalist Network sites, including Naturalista (Mexico and Colombia), iNaturalist.NZ (New Zealand), iNaturalist.ca (Canada), Biodiversity4All (Portugal), iNaturalistAU (Australia), iNaturalistPa (Panama), iNaturalistEc (Ecuador), ArgentiNat (Argentina), iNaturalistil (Israel), and iNaturalistFi (Suomi/Finland)."

ABC Puzzles are the perfect gentle introduction to LETTER NAMES, SHAPES, and SPELLING.====\n\nLearning ABCs has never been simpler! In this fun educational puzzle game, toddlers and preschoolers learn to recognize letter names, build familiarity with shapes of uppercase and lowercase letters, associate each letter with a variety of objects whose name begins with that letter, and spell basic words. By acquiring familiarity with letter names and shapes in this way, children develop a solid foundation for success on their early reading journey.\n\nRecommended age range: 2-4 years.\n\nLet your children explore the shapes and names of letters with this new fun app developed by an award-winning educational publisher, 22learn, the creator of the best-selling Abby Basic Skills app.\n\nVARIETY OF FUN LEARNING INTERACTIONS\n* 5 simple games for each letter (letter puzzle mode) and one game for spelling (word puzzle mode) provide a variety of learning interactions that children enjoy.\n* For example, children love to pop balloons with a letter they are learning – as they progress in the game, the weather changes in the background and reveals a beautiful rainbow once children master the letter!\n* In the letter puzzle mode, children 1) drag uppercase and lowercase letters to their matching shades, 2) associate the letters with pictures of words whose name begins with those letters, 3) tap on fun letter balloons to hear letter names as they pop the balloons, and 4) compose shapes of each individual letter.\n* In the word puzzle mode, children match letters with their shapes to spell a word.\n\nBUILD FOR INDEPENDENT EXPLORATION\n* ABC Puzzles is designed from the ground up to enable young children’s independent play and foster their sense of competence as they independently navigate the game environment to select which letters or words they wish to practice.\n* All the items to be moved are large enough to be easily grasped by children’s fingers.\n* No complicated menus have to be accessed by a child in order to play the game on his or her own.\n\nPOSITIVE, ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENT\n* Only positive reinforcement is provided to engage children.\n* Full of colorful illustrations that children love.\n\nABC Puzzles feature a beautiful, bright, colorful design and simple interface that children love. We hope your children enjoy this gentle introduction to the world of letters the same way that our little beta-testers did!"

Install, get info, help, and assistance you need.\n\nDetect. What kind of plant is that? Identifying plants you don't know yet but already like (or are simply interested in) is more than easy with Lily now. Only take a photo and get a couple of quick results. Find an option that interests you and maybe other engaging and similar suggestions that the app will also find for you—more options - more interesting plants to your collection.\n\nGather as many species as you like in one spot. Form your collection by adding new samples easily. Lily can help you with arranging the database with plants you like. Need any fresh ideas?\n\nSearch for the new samples. You may easily get dozens of new plants to your collection. Simply use their names for searches. Lily will help you with that and provide accurate results in line with the inquiries that the app will get from you.   \n\nKnowing the name of a plant you like or are simply interested in is not enough for you? Lily has detailed descriptions in its database about each plant detected. Only start searches and get the description with all details you need to know about a target plant for a start. This will be its visuals, info about the geography that a plant has, basic things about the care it needs, even history it has, and not only. \n\nSave your plants from stopping living also with Lily. Forgetting about weekly or daily care routines is a possible consequence of living in a busy modern world. The app can help you with preventing that and remind you about must-have care your plants need. Set reminders in time only.

      "label": "Make building your vocabulary fun and simple with WordPal.\n\nWordPal is a useful app that can be used to improve your English vocabulary, whether it be to help you sound more intelligent, directly in exams, in words games such as Scrabble or Boggle, with creative writing or anything else.\n\nThe simple, clean interface allows you to concentrate on learning and progressing swiftly, without any annoying distractions. The app uses a special algorithm centred around the scientifically proven approach of spaced repetition to determine which words you aren’t so confident with, allowing it to prioritise the order in which words are served. This allows you to quickly learn new words and grow your English vocabulary whilst also reinforcing the meaning of words that you already know.\n\nThe selected words are based on their frequency in the English language in its everyday use, meaning that you are learning words that you don’t know while still being able to use these words every day - there would be no point in learning words you would never use, see or hear!\n\nAfter downloading the app, you will be able to enjoy the many features WordPal has to offer for free:\n- Pick the synonym of the word given from multiple choice\n- See the word’s definition(s) to help you better understand the word\n- See an example for each definition to show the word in context\n- Access your progress at any time to get a feel for how you are doing; get regular updates of your progress while learning to show how you are improving your vocabulary\n- 5 progress levels are used: mastered, nearly mastered, getting there, keep trying and work needed — this helps to see how well you know each word\n- Sleek, clean design\n- Set a daily goal to help keep you on track and set up notification reminders for specific times of the day, allowing you to improve your vocabulary every day and learn new words rapidly through spaced repetition\n- Build up a streak (the number of consecutive days you have achieved your daily goal)\n- Extremely intuitive and simple to use\n\nA premium version (WordPal Premium Subscription) is available through subscription which includes more words, games, and the ability to bookmark words.\n\n\nPicking the correct synonym is a very useful method for growing your vocabulary quickly:\n- Firstly, it makes it easier for you to use more advanced words when you speak or write. If you wanted to find a better word for something, you would look in a thesaurus (a thesaurus shows synonyms for words), but if you know a synonym for each word you learn in the app, you will find it easier to replace that synonym with the more advanced vocabulary word in everyday speech and writing.\n- Secondly, knowing a synonym serves as a trigger word in your memory to help you remember the general meaning of each word - having this trigger word makes it easier to remember the definitions and examples you have seen in our app when you see or hear a word.\n\n\nWhy do our users love our app?\n- It’s a fun approach that we developed to help users learn English vocabulary - it turns it into a game!\n- It sparks rapid growth in users’ vocabulary as a result of our special algorithm\n- It’s so easy to use with the intuitive, simple interface\n- It’s so easy to understand our definitions and examples\n- It’s so easy to track your progress\n\nThe app may be useful in preparation for many exams where a strong vocabulary helps, such as GCSE English, A-level English, SAT, GRE, IELTS, TOEFL, ESL, ACT, GMAT, MAT, CAT, SSC, IBPS PO, Bank Clerk, RRB, SBI, USPC, IAS, NDA, AFCAT and other college admissions tests, placement exams, recruitment tests and aptitude tests.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/42679425\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.iubenda.com/terms-and-conditions/42679425"

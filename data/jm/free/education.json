It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

Over 1 million bright minds saved more than 14 million ideas in their personal library so far.\n\nIt's like your social media feed, if your social media feed had things that mattered :-)\n\nKnowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.\n\nIdeas are created by Deepstash members, called stashers. Whenever a stasher reads a book article or listens to a podcast and they find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, they will add an idea about it in Deepstash.\n\nA daily source of inspiring & life changing stories and ideas. Read articles, learn skills, get productivity tips and discover life hacks. The magic of Deepstash is that everything you do builds your knowledge library: be it contributing  your own ideas or collecting idea cards from other stashers. Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.\n\nPERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS\n\nChoose a few topics of interest (more than 4,000 topics to choose from) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.\n\nThe more you save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.\n\nBUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nYou can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.\n\nSearch and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes, which are basically collections of insights stocked up and ready to go for when you need them: a Powerpoint presentation, a new job interview, a date, a project at work, or negotiating your rent with the landlord.\n\nSHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nAdd your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.\n\nShare your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this. \n\nShare a link to ideas or just an image. We built special image formats for each social network (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and others) so your ideas will look their best.\n\nNO ADS. NO DISTRACTIONS\n\nThe Deepstash app is free and open to everyone. Get a clean reading experience and focus on the content instead of being distracted with annoying ads. Just get a quick free account (Facebook & Google login) and you’re good to go.\n\nGood for your career. \nGreat for your life. \nGive it a shot!\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://deepstash.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://deepstash.com/privacy-policy"

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

The app uses a special algorithm centred around the scientifically proven approach of spaced repetition to determine which words you aren’t so confident with, allowing it to prioritise the order in which words are served. This allows you to quickly learn new words and grow your English vocabulary whilst also reinforcing the meaning of words that you already know.\n\nThe selected words are based on their frequency in the English language in its everyday use, meaning that you are learning words that you don’t know while still being able to use these words every day - there would be no point in learning words you would never use, see or hear!\n\nAfter downloading the app, you will be able to enjoy the many features WordPal has to offer for free:\n- Pick the synonym of the word given from multiple choice\n- See the word’s definition(s) to help you better understand the word\n- See an example for each definition to show the word in context\n- Access your progress at any time to get a feel for how you are doing; get regular updates of your progress while learning to show how you are improving your vocabulary\n- 5 progress levels are used: mastered, nearly mastered, getting there, keep trying and work needed — this helps to see how well you know each word\n- Sleek, clean design\n- Set a daily goal to help keep you on track and set up notification reminders for specific times of the day, allowing you to improve your vocabulary every day and learn new words rapidly through spaced repetition\n- Build up a streak (the number of consecutive days you have achieved your daily goal)\n- Extremely intuitive and simple to use\n\nA premium version (WordPal Premium Subscription) is available through subscription which includes more words, games, and the ability to bookmark words.\n\n\nPicking the correct synonym is a very useful method for growing your vocabulary quickly:\n- Firstly, it makes it easier for you to use more advanced words when you speak or write. If you wanted to find a better word for something, you would look in a thesaurus (a thesaurus shows synonyms for words), but if you know a synonym for each word you learn in the app, you will find it easier to replace that synonym with the more advanced vocabulary word in everyday speech and writing.\n- Secondly, knowing a synonym serves as a trigger word in your memory to help you remember the general meaning of each word - having this trigger word makes it easier to remember the definitions and examples you have seen in our app when you see or hear a word.\n\n\nWhy do our users love our app?\n- It’s a fun approach that we developed to help users learn English vocabulary - it turns it into a game!\n- It sparks rapid growth in users’ vocabulary as a result of our special algorithm\n- It’s so easy to use with the intuitive, simple interface\n- It’s so easy to understand our definitions and examples\n- It’s so easy to track your progress\n\nThe app may be useful in preparation for many exams where a strong vocabulary helps, such as GCSE English, A-level English, SAT, GRE, IELTS, TOEFL, ESL, ACT, GMAT, MAT, CAT, SSC, IBPS PO, Bank Clerk, RRB, SBI, USPC, IAS, NDA, AFCAT and other college admissions tests, placement exams, recruitment tests and aptitude tests.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/42679425\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.iubenda.com/terms-and-conditions/42679425"

The app automatically generates simple math questions and expects the user to estimate the missing number(s).\n\nThe app is bundled with two sub-apps\n\n\t1.\tCalculate the Following\n\t2.\tHow do we make Numbers\n\nThe app starts with a simple math question and automatically generates difficult questions over progression.\n\nBoth programs, in a fun to learn activity, silently develops the following abilities specially in teens and early learners.\n\n\t•\tUnderstanding combination of different numbers produces the same result (2+7 = 5+4).\n\t•\tLeft to right, Top to bottom sequence to solve math equations.\n\t•\tBuilds ability to solve complex problems.\n\t•\tUnderstanding about how a set of opposite numbers cancel each other (+5 -5 = +2 - 2).\n\t•\tCalculated estimation.\n\t•\tExamination of a product’s construction. (reverse engineering an equation).\n\t•\tIncreases the attention span.\n\t•\tMental arithmetic.\n\t•\tSpeed calculations.\n\nThe app has several salient features.\n\t•\tThe app is providing many controls to adjust the generated question to suite various requirements.\n\t•\tThe app difficulty level can be made fixed.\n\t•\tCoins, awards and achievements builds motivation to keep practicing.\n\t•\tDrag and drop scenario are meditating for kids and they keep their interest in practicing math. \n\t•\tRandomized, simple yet challenging questions to solve.\n\t•\tThe app’s interface is user friendly and attractive. \n\n1) \"Calculate the Following\" is for relatively young ones. It generates a very simple question and ask the user to drag the correct answer in the Answer Box. It generates a math question that is primarily built for early learners (grade 1). The question is so simple that the kid doesn’t have to calculate above number 10. The operation is limited to addition and subtraction only.\n\n2) \"How do we make Numbers\" is ideal for 1st grade to any age group. The app generates a math equation where the user has to guess the missing number. Depending on the difficulty level, the operation can involve addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of higher numbers. Also, a question might have two blank pieces to fill.\n\nNOTE:\n1. The app uses left to right sequence for calculation and doesn’t use DMAS rule for few reasons. However we are working to provide it as an additional difficulty level in future versions. \n\n2. The app is provided as a limited version for demonstration and it contains ads, the complete app can be unlocked by using In App purchases within the app. It is strongly recommended that the kids practice the ads-free complete app.\n\nA reset button is provided so the kids can use the app at initial levels.\n\nWe look forward for your input to make the app even better. Please consider to support us by rating the app and writing a small review. It also helps us to produce new and better apps."

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Welcome to Pepi Wonder World Lite! It‘s a magical, fairy tale inspired adventure into an island filled with fantasy characters, magic spells and royal fun!\n\nCREATIVE PLAY\n \nThis is the most magical Pepi game so far and by that we mean fantastic spells, adventurous knights, dancing horses and baby dragons. Its positively insane and highly inspirational, cause the game is all about the fairy tales we love so much! Imagine a dollhouse or a sandbox filled with toys to the brim.

Dozens of characters and hundreds of usable items is a perfect opportunity to learn new words, storytelling and just a little bit of acting through roleplay.\n\nCURIOSITY... GAVE CAT BOOTS!\n\nWe all know that saying, but in our games curiosity and exploration is the key! With every new game in our dollhouse series, we are increasing the number of items, animations, and possible combinations. We encourage kids to be brave in their explorations, thus we have even more hidden items, secret areas and cheeky puzzles in our kingdom this time. The most amazing thing about this? Well, we‘re looking to add more fairy tale worlds to our game, so in the future, your characters will be able to board the ship and travel to the Dwarf Island, where new adventures await! \n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n• 30+ new characters including knights, princess‘es, baby dragons and ghosts!\n• Loaded with animations and interactions — use musical instruments, craft items, shoot bows, have crazy, medieval fun! \n• Proper fairy tale world, filled with enchanting spells, secrets and surprises!\n• Find the hidden keys and explore secret rooms to find even more toys to play with.\n• Use, mix and match any item and equipment You can find and get surprising results!\n• Different scenes.

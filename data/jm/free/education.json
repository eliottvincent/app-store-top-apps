Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

      "label": "Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational app to help your toddler learn phonics and trace letters of the alphabet? Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

It is the only Sabbath School app with these exciting and useful features:\r\n\r\n• You can highlight portions of text, so they pop out in Sabbath School.\r\n• You can write notes just like in the paper copy.\r\n• Bible references are turned into weblinks for quick viewing.\r\n• The teachers edition for the week can be viewed with a simple click.\r\n\r\nSabbath School Quarterly app allows you to take your Seventh-Day Adventist Biblical studies wherever you bring your phone. Most Seventh-Day Adventist churches teach on the same topic or reading in a given week, as each quarter of the year has a different theme that reflects Bible, doctrinal, or church lifestyle teachings. Thus the lesson booklet is called quarterly.\r\nThis app provides you with all of the Sabbath School quarterlies for the current and previous three quarters. It lets you take notes, and it remembers the notes for later when you are taking part in the discussion during Sabbath school. The app allows you to hone in on the specific week and day of study and enables you to move from one day to another with a tap or swipe of your finger.\r\n\r\nThe SDA Sabbath School Quarterly App is an independent ministry that supports the mission of the Seventh-day Adventist® Church; however, it is not part of, affiliated with, or supported by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists® headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland or any of its affiliates known as the Seventh-day Adventist ® Church. Thus, any content or opinions expressed, implied or included beyond that included in the Seventh-day Adventist Quarterly are solely those of the creators or owners of the SDA Sabbath School Quarterly App and not those of the General Conference or the Seventh-day Adventist® Church.\r\n\r\nSDA Seventh-day adventist Sabbath School Quarterly.\r\nIASD Iglesia Adventista del Septimo Dia Escuela Sabática."

Whether you’re still in your pregnancy journey or you’ve already brought home your newborn baby, you’re right to wonder how you can help them succeed. And now look no further, because Prodigy Baby has the solution for you!\n\nTEACH YOUR BABY\nProdigy Baby is a unique baby learning system that allows you to reach baby milestones early through a variety of developmental activities. And best of all, the framework includes NO SCREENTIME for babies: we’re interested in raising superstars, not gluing your babies to a screen. Through our revolutionary learning system, your child can:\nLearn to read (as early as age 2!)\nLearn to speak\nLearn numbers and math\nDevelop creativity\nDevelop incredible athletic skills\nAnd so much more!\n\nTAILORED TO YOUR NEEDS\nWhen you download the Prodigy Baby app, you will be able to take a quiz regarding your baby’s stage of development and the skills and developmental milestones you wish to jumpstart. Once you’ve completed the quiz, you will receive a program recommendation for your baby care and learning system. The baby activities are specifically designed to help unlock particular abilities, not just as a random collection of things to do - the difference will show!\n\nBABY GAMES ON A BABY SCHEDULE\nThe wonder weeks from age 0-2 are an important, but particular period of baby development. For this reason, we don’t want to overwhelm the baby or the parenting experience. With this in mind, the Prodigy Baby programs are super easy and convenient and require only 5 minutes of daily developmental activities with the baby.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe Prodigy Baby app is based on the Prodigy Baby framework. Developed after 2,000+ hours of study, it is a simple but powerful step-by-step program created to help your baby ignite their hidden genius potential efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe framework combines the methodologies of the greatest parenting minds in the world, including Glenn Doman, Makoto Shichida, Maria Montessori, Waldorf, and others, to create a fun, accelerated learning system that helps your child unleash their hidden talents.\n \nWEEKLY PLANS\nExplore our learning system for newborns which is carefully planned with weekly schedules for newborn baby games. We know parents are not teachers and we don’t want you to be. So don’t worry about the development planning, that’s all on us. Simply follow the program laid out and watch the baby learning activities take root! Try keeping a baby learning growth chart and watch yourself be blown away! You may think you’re seeing things, but the milestone tracker can’t lie.\n\nDownload today and see why we’ve been featured in The Economic Times, The Times of India, Entrepreneur Magazine, and more!

      "label": "Thousands of users love Intelli Flashcards for its simplicity, effectiveness and elegance.\n\nBut first things first. This app is not free, as the value you get using it properly is enormous. I also don’t want you to do a blind bargain by making this app a paid one. So here is the deal: download it for free, try it with the only limitation of 50 flashcards, and if you love it, support the project by making an in-app purchase.\n\nYou add flashcards on your own, with vocabs or information you want to remember. Alternatively, you can import a 2-column CSV file with vocabs, if you have one.\n\nThe app is built around Spaced Repetition technique, which is not the best to learn new information (yes, I was wrong believing that initially), but the best to keep the information you’ve learnt. However, you can also learn with flashcards if you have a good visual memory. The best combination: learn new information by building up the associations and move that information to long-time memory by repeating it with flashcards.\n\nUnder the hood you will find Sebastian Leitner’s algorithm which basically has two simple rules: if you remember what’s on the back side of the card, the repeating interval is doubled (1-2-4-8-16 days and so on). If you forget the back side, start all over again with daily repeating. \n\nIntelli Flashcards was designed to be used every day by someone, who learns foreign language. I’m aware of the fact, that average user would add 1500+ flashcards on his learning path. He might be outdoors and in a rush, so the process of creating a new flashcard is 0 clicks away - it’s right on the main screen! The repeating session is just 1 click away.\n\nAfter a year of testing the spaced repetition algorithm, Derek Sivers (entrepreneur, programmer, founder of CD Baby and just a great person) stated that it was the most helpful learning technique he has tried for 14 years. To read more about Derek’s experiment, visit  www.sivers.org/srs \n\nFrom developer: after finishing working on Intelli, I started to use it to learn Spanish just to test the effectiveness of this algorithm. Intelli is not the only tool I’ve used, but it had the biggest impact on the learning speed and effectivity. I went from 0 to C1 level in Spanish in just 1 year, spending in average 15-20 minutes on learning every day. To read about other tools I’ve used to learn Spanish, go to www.boweidmann.com/language-learning\n\nBut then I’ve stumbled upon a great article about language learning, written by Tim Ferriss, the best-selling author and self-experimenter:\n\nhttp://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/16/how-to-learn-any-language-in-record-time-and-never-forget-it/\n\nInspired by that article, I’ve worked on the possibility of adding images directly to flashcards. Version 3.0 was born. Thank you, Tim! That function has enhanced the experience the users have got with the app. And it’s much more interesting to recall a vocab looking on image. That’s how Rosetta Stone works. That’s how we recall our native vocabs. Maybe I should start a new language just to test this technique with images. ;)\n\nUser experience is one of the keywords this app is built around. So your opinion on that is very important to me. You can contact me personally out of the app and receive my response as soon as possible. \n\nWhen I develop a new version of the app, I make sure new functionality does not affect the original user experience. However, it’s hard to predict the way you are going to make use of it. So if there is some unexpected behavior of the app, feel free to tell me about it.\n\nAnd when somewhere in the future you realize, Intelli has supported you a lot on your path of learning, I’d love your short review in AppStore."

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

Riding on the track is completely similar to the real ride: there are gas pedal, road tilt, acceleration, braking effect and others.\n\nThis game perfectly develops logic thinking. The child would be happy to \"work\" in the garage, trying to drive with the new wheels, lights, arcs, spoilers, wings, etc. A wide range of components allows the child to create a unique car and then test it on the road. The game process like a real driving makes your child feel happy. It brings a great joy and emotions that will be exploded into a storm of cheers! Let give a young driver some fun and experience of realistic driving. Kids will definitely feel excited!"

It is the only Sabbath School app with these exciting and useful features:\r\n\r\n• You can highlight portions of text, so they pop out in Sabbath School.\r\n• You can write notes just like in the paper copy.\r\n• Bible references are turned into weblinks for quick viewing.\r\n• The teachers edition for the week can be viewed with a simple click.\r\n\r\nSabbath School Quarterly app allows you to take your Seventh-Day Adventist Biblical studies wherever you bring your phone. Most Seventh-Day Adventist churches teach on the same topic or reading in a given week, as each quarter of the year has a different theme that reflects Bible, doctrinal, or church lifestyle teachings. Thus the lesson booklet is called quarterly.\r\nThis app provides you with all of the Sabbath School quarterlies for the current and previous three quarters. It lets you take notes, and it remembers the notes for later when you are taking part in the discussion during Sabbath school. The app allows you to hone in on the specific week and day of study and enables you to move from one day to another with a tap or swipe of your finger.\r\n\r\nThe SDA Sabbath School Quarterly App is an independent ministry that supports the mission of the Seventh-day Adventist® Church; however, it is not part of, affiliated with, or supported by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists® headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland or any of its affiliates known as the Seventh-day Adventist ® Church. Thus, any content or opinions expressed, implied or included beyond that included in the Seventh-day Adventist Quarterly are solely those of the creators or owners of the SDA Sabbath School Quarterly App and not those of the General Conference or the Seventh-day Adventist® Church.\r\n\r\nSDA Seventh-day adventist Sabbath School Quarterly.\r\nIASD Iglesia Adventista del Septimo Dia Escuela Sabática."

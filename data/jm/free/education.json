Form your collection by adding new samples easily. Lily can help you with arranging the database with plants you like. Need any fresh ideas?\n\nSearch for the new samples. You may easily get dozens of new plants to your collection. Simply use their names for searches. Lily will help you with that and provide accurate results in line with the inquiries that the app will get from you.   \n\nKnowing the name of a plant you like or are simply interested in is not enough for you? Lily has detailed descriptions in its database about each plant detected. Only start searches and get the description with all details you need to know about a target plant for a start. This will be its visuals, info about the geography that a plant has, basic things about the care it needs, even history it has, and not only. \n\nSave your plants from stopping living also with Lily. Forgetting about weekly or daily care routines is a possible consequence of living in a busy modern world. The app can help you with preventing that and remind you about must-have care your plants need. Set reminders in time only. Don't forget about that. \n\nDiscuss any problems with experts directly in this app. You don't need to waste your time for endless discussions using emails.

      "label": "This is the most feature packed Sabbath School quarterly on the market. Use it to enhance your lesson study. This is the app for true lesson study. It is the only Sabbath School app with these exciting and useful features:\r\n\r\n• You can highlight portions of text, so they pop out in Sabbath School.\r\n• You can write notes just like in the paper copy.\r\n• Bible references are turned into weblinks for quick viewing.\r\n• The teachers edition for the week can be viewed with a simple click.\r\n\r\nSabbath School Quarterly app allows you to take your Seventh-Day Adventist Biblical studies wherever you bring your phone. Most Seventh-Day Adventist churches teach on the same topic or reading in a given week, as each quarter of the year has a different theme that reflects Bible, doctrinal, or church lifestyle teachings. Thus the lesson booklet is called quarterly.\r\nThis app provides you with all of the Sabbath School quarterlies for the current and previous three quarters. It lets you take notes, and it remembers the notes for later when you are taking part in the discussion during Sabbath school. The app allows you to hone in on the specific week and day of study and enables you to move from one day to another with a tap or swipe of your finger.\r\n\r\nThe SDA Sabbath School Quarterly App is an independent ministry that supports the mission of the Seventh-day Adventist® Church; however, it is not part of, affiliated with, or supported by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists® headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland or any of its affiliates known as the Seventh-day Adventist ® Church.

Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n• 2019 PCMag Editors’ Choice\n• 2019 Tabby Awards Winner\n• 2019 Best Mobile App Awards: Best Designed App and Best Overall App\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next.

Our deepest assumptions control everything we say, everything we do, and everything we think. It is important that we get them right.\n\nLearn to see through the complex issues of our day like a superhero with x-ray vision. With a little practice you can find the hidden assumptions in the messages you encounter daily in as little as 20 seconds! You can tell whether those messages are true, not based on the message itself, but based on the message behind the message - its hidden assumptions. So simple a middle schooler can use it, but so powerful that adults will find how the power of assumptions affects everything in their public lives.\n\nBased on the innovative, ground-breaking new book, \"Transparent: How to See Through the Powerful Assumptions That Control You,\" the \"Transparent\" app gives you the ability to discover the hidden assumptions in your own life. It also allows you to see through the assumptions in the things you read like in a book, article, or webpage; the things you watch like in a TV show or movie; or the things you hear like in a classroom lecture, talk radio, lyrics in a song, or talk radio. You'll never watch the news, read an article, or listen to a conversation the same way again!"

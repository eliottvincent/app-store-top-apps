Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

RANKED #1 APP FOR KIDS on APP Store in many countries. \n\nLet's come and play with me! \nThis new user-friendly wonderful Abby's Magic Laptop for Preschool and Toddlers welcomes you to the colorful world of exploration and learning! This adorable learn and play laptop teaches children letters, numbers, colors, shapes, animals, toys, fruits, musical instruments, and more. Kids will love switching between categories. Actions lead to learning!\n\nThe application offers you in total the possibility of choosing from 12(!) thematic categories. Children will be thrilled to play with this laptop and learn new things.  The numerous buttons the laptop offers invite exploration and enable children to determine their own pace of learning according to their individual needs.\n\nThe laptop includes two game modes: 'Let's Play!' and 'Let's Learn!' The switching between the modes is made easy by two large red buttons. Children typically do not experience problems learning to activate these two modes, but in case they do, we encourage parents to switch the mode\nfor their children.\n\n*Let's Play!*\nThe 'Let's Play!' mode is designed primarily for children unfamiliar with the objects included, or those who want to refresh and enhance their knowledge of the already acquired vocabulary. To activate the mode, simply press the 'Let's play!' button,  and choose a desired thematic category from one of the blue buttons in the upper half of the gaming space. For instance, after pressing a blue button with a picture of a ball, there are going to appear buttons with toys theme on the lower half of the gaming screen. When pressing the individual picture buttons then, the pictures are going to appear enlarged on the laptop monitor, the pronounced name and the written form of the word as well as its authentic sound and small animation follows afterwards.\n\n*Let's Learn!*\nDo you want some practice too? Don't forget to try the 'Let's Learn!' mode! To activate this mode, tap on the 'Let's Learn' button. Afterwards, choose one of the twelve thematic categories and let the challenge begin! When the category has been selected, an enthusiastic monkey Abby appears on the laptop monitor and gives tasks to a child. The task is always to select the picture of the correct item that she pronounced. Of course, after each correct answer, the cute monkey provides words of praise and\nencouragement.\n\nTo make the laptop more engaging, we also included four colorful buttons in the lower half of the game screen. These simulate the functions of a videophone and include such funny effects such as entertaining sound effects and melodies.\n\nThank you for selecting our app! We sincerely hope your children will enjoy it!\n\nYour 22learn team!"

      "label": "Welcome to \"Lila's World\" \n\nPlay as Lila while she visits her Grandma's house for the summer. There are a lot of things to discover all throughout this mystery manor in which Grandma lives. Explore the house, read a book in the library or have a tea party in the living room. Play the piano in the Music room or Cook almost any dish you can think of in the Kitchen. While you explore, don’t forget to look for the many secrets of the house. Now what could Grandma be hiding?\n\nNot only can you play in Grandma's house but you can draw and create your own worlds too. Use real paper and colors to draw new characters, scenes, food, objects and a lot more. \n\nBrowse all the different worlds created by all the imaginative kids out there. The possibilities are endless. \n\nMaybe you can help Lila setup her cousin Ro's birthday party, or go to the park for a picnic with her friends. \n\nMaybe you can sail the oceans on a pirate ship, or just have fun day at the beach with your family.\n\nYou can also play with your own drawn characters in the real world in the AR mode. Just watch as your own drawings come to life. It’s like Magic!\n\nMake your own pretend play world!\n\nPLAY:\nIn “Lila’s Word” there are no rules and no goals. Playing is as easy as tapping and dragging the characters to move them around so that different real world situations can be recreated. Most objects can be dragged around and moved in the scenes. Some items can be tapped to perform different specific actions like turning a light bulb ON and OFF or opening doors to go to other rooms. Make sure to check the Kitchen to find the hundreds of recipes. Just combining one ingredient with another can make new dishes like adding bread and cheese will create a cheese sandwich. However,  there are a few more complicated recipes which can be created by combining multiple ingredients in the oven and turning it ON. Be careful though, if they don’t combine well together, you will get a burnt dish… Yuck! Exploring is key in Lila’s world so make sure you check all the different areas of the game. There are many secrets hidden all around Grandma’s house so the more you explore, the more you will find. \n  \nCREATE - DRAWING and COLORING:\nOne of the most unique aspects of our game is the Create section. Here, users are encouraged to create their own scenes. Use the Create button to add your own items into the game. If you want your favorite toy in the game just make a drawing of it, take a picture from the Create menu and you can have it right in the game with you. Your favorite meal is not in the game? No problem, make a drawing of it and add it in yourself. Do you want to enter the game yourself? No problem, just make a drawing of yourself and enter the game directly. Maybe you want a different scene to play in but you don’t want to draw it yourself. Also, coming soon is the ability to browse other people's scenes and download them too. Soon you will be able to share your scenes and visit your friends scenes too.\n\nLEARN:\nNew Scenes every month. Learn about the following:\n- Different festivals from around the world\n- New cities to explore\n- A trip down your neighborhood \n\nSAFE FOR KIDS:\n\"Lila's World\" is absolutely safe for kids. Even while we allow kids to play with other kid's creations from around the world, we make sure all our content is moderated and nothing is approved without getting approved first. We collect no personal information and your can play completely offline if you want as well.\n\nYou can find our Terms of Use here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/terms-and-conditions-lila-s-world\n\nYou can find our Privacy Policy here:\nhttps://photontadpole.com/privacy-policy-lila-s-world\n\nThis App has No Ads or no Social Media links.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can email us at support@photontadpole.com"

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities. The first was the Great Bible commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII, and the second was the Bishops' Bible of 1568. In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference where a new English version was conceived in response to the perceived problems of the earlier translations as detected by the Puritans, a faction within the Church of England.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin. In the Book of Common Prayer (1662), the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible – for Epistle and Gospel readings – and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament. By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and Protestant churches. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars. Today, the most used edition of the King James Bible, and often identified as plainly the King James Version, especially in the United States, closely follows the standard text of 1769, edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford."

      "label": "Tracing Projector is your personal portable drawing and composition tool.\n\nHaving Tracing Projector is like always having a sheet of tracing paper with you! Choose any image you'd like to draw, take a photo, or choose from hundreds of images supplied in the app; then look at your screen while you trace the image on paper!\n\n- Learn to Draw! Learn proportions and important lines by tracing photos of anything! Use several filters to enhance your photo, making it easier to trace.\n\n- Make real one-of-a-kind artwork you can hang on your wall! Send unique greetings on social media! Friends and family will love to see your animated drawings!\n\n- Show off your skills! Record a video while you draw and share it on your favorite social network. Your friends will be amazed! Choose from time-lapse and regular speeds, and include a narrative if you want to. \n\n- Great for face painting or artistic makeup!\n\n- Great for school projects! Need to draw an image from a book on a poster? Trace it!\n\n- Kick-start your painting or portrait! Transfer your idea from a photo to your drawing canvas to get the proportions right.\n\n- Match the Composition! Transfer your plan from a sketch to the scrapbook page or photo wall! \n\n- Challenge yourself to sketch the essence of the image before the timer runs out! Focus on composition and structure. Freehand the fine details afterward, or disable Quick Sketch and trace them directly. (Disabling requires a one-time purchase.)\n\nSeveral tools make it really easy to trace your image:\n\n- Light Table - lock your screen, turn up the brightness, and trace the image from your screen directly!\n\n- Handheld Mode -- On supported devices, Augmented Reality keeps your tracing image steady while you hold your device at a comfortable angle. (demo video https://youtu.be/YJeK5Sjdi1Q). Requires iOS 11.3 or later on iPhone 6s/6s Plus or iPad Pro and later. Works best on stable horizontal and vertical surfaces with good light and some visible surface detail.\n\n- Lock the camera focus to keep the image steady while you trace.\n\n- Lock the canvas area to keep your layout and alignment while you zoom in to get a close look at your work in progress.\n\n- Several Filter modes enhance your image, increasing contrast to give you a better result.\n\n- Use the flashlight to light up your drawing. (requires Full Version)\n\n- Use the selfie camera and draw on your face. (requires Full Version)\n\n\nOther features make it fun and easy to share your creations with your friends.\n\n- Video recording in Time Lapse mode to make things smaller and faster and cooler. You can enable normal-speed and audio on the Settings screen.\n\n- The recorded video or snapshot includes a small thumbnail of the tracing image (with an option to turn that off).\n\n- Your videos and snapshots are stored automatically and available to share later from within the app, the Files app, or iTunes.\n\n- Sharing your videos and photos is easy with a preview screen and saved photos/videos!\n\n- Interrupted while recording your drawing? No problem - Combine multiple videos to create a single video for sharing! Use the Edit feature on the Saved Files screen: select two movies and tap Join.\n\n\nTracing Projector is Enhanced For 3D Touch! Start right away from the camera or photo album from the home screen! Force-touch on the tracing image to peek at your progress while you draw!\n\n\nNotes:\n- For best results, stabilize your device above your drawing surface. A stack of books, drinking glass, or tripod works best.\n- The app requires access to your camera in order to present its overlay for drawing.\n- The app requires access to your photos in order to load an image to trace and to save the video of your drawing.\n- The app optionally uses your microphone when recording a video while you draw."

You can review your answers after the timer runs out and see whether you picked up the normals. You also get to see the diagnoses of the abnormal x-rays. Try to improve on your results to become faster and more accurate.  \n\nThis game will help with preparation for the FRCR 2B Rapid Reporting Exam but if you need more rapid reporting practice in a platform that simulates the examination, visit the Revise Radiology website."

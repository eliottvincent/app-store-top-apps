It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

Most Seventh-Day Adventist churches teach on the same topic or reading in a given week, as each quarter of the year has a different theme that reflects Bible, doctrinal, or church lifestyle teachings. Thus the lesson booklet is called quarterly.\r\nThis app provides you with all of the Sabbath School quarterlies for the current and previous three quarters. It lets you take notes, and it remembers the notes for later when you are taking part in the discussion during Sabbath school. The app allows you to hone in on the specific week and day of study and enables you to move from one day to another with a tap or swipe of your finger.\r\n\r\nThe SDA Sabbath School Quarterly App is an independent ministry that supports the mission of the Seventh-day Adventist® Church; however, it is not part of, affiliated with, or supported by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists® headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland or any of its affiliates known as the Seventh-day Adventist ® Church.

      "label": "Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational app to help your toddler learn phonics and trace letters of the alphabet? Look no further than ABC Kids.\n\nABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!\n\nABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.\n\nBest of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.\n\nFeatures:\n- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.\n- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.\n- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.\n- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.\n- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!\n\nNote to Parents:\nWhen creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it, too!\n\n- Best wishes from the parents at RV AppStudios"

Some drivers need more practice than others. Minors (under 18 years old) must complete 50 hours of behind*the*wheel training (10 hours must be night driving) before taking a driving test. When you practice, pretend you are taking a driving test. Ask your accompanying driver to calmly point out your mistakes. Ask questions about particular driving situations that may have confused you and correct your mistakes. The next time you practice, try to correct any driving errors you made before. The DMV examiner is there to ensure you have demonstrated that you can handle your vehicle in regular traffic situations, not to trick you. During your driving test, the examiner will note how you obey the rules of the road and traffic signs and/or signals. They will note other areas in which you may need improvement.\n- Practice safe driving tips. To improve your driving skills:\n    * Steer smoothly at all times.\n    * Accelerate smoothly. Don’t rev the engine or make it stall.\n    * Stop the vehicle gently. Start braking well ahead of where you must stop to avoid sudden movement. Know where to stop. Be aware of crosswalks. If your view is blocked at a crosswalk, move forward carefully and look both ways before entering the intersection.\n    * Be sure your vehicle is in the correct gear. Don’t grind the gears. Don’t coast to a stop.\n    * Always obey the posted speed limits. If needed, reduce your speed to adjust for existing weather, road, and other traffic conditions. Remember to turn on your headlights if you need to use your windshield wipers in poor weather conditions.\n    * Follow at a safe distance. Use the 3 second rule. Increase your following distance in bad weather or poor visibility.\n    * Know what the traffic signals mean and obey them at all times.\n    * Always use the proper lane and start a turn from the correct lane into the correct lane.\n    * Signal for all lane changes and turns.\n    * Always look for potential hazards (scan), and check your mirrors frequently. Always look over the proper shoulder before making lane changes or pulling away from the curb.\n    * Drive defensively. Anticipate another driver’s errors.\n\nPractice written tests are available for all states:\n- Alabama AL\n- Arkansas AR\n- Arizona AZ\n- California CA\n- Colorado CO\n- Connecticut CT\n- District Of Columbia DC\n- Delaware DE\n- Florida FL\n- Georgia GA\n- Hawaii HI\n- Iowa IA\n- Idaho ID\n- Illinois IL\n- Indiana IN\n- Kansas KS\n- Kentucky KY\n- Louisiana LA\n- Massachusetts MA\n- Maryland MD\n- Maine ME\n- Michigan MI\n- Minnesota MN\n- Missouri MO\n- Mississippi MS\n- Montana MT\n- North Carolina NC\n- North Dakota ND\n- Nebraska NE\n- New Hampshire NH\n- New Jersey NJ\n- New Mexico NM\n- Nevada NV\n- New York NY\n- Ohio OH\n- Oklahoma OK\n- Oregon OR\n- Pennsylvania PA\n- Rhode Island RI\n- South Carolina SC\n- South Dakota SD\n- Tennessee TN\n- Texas TX\n- Utah UT\n- Virginia VA\n- Vermont VT\n- Washington WA\n- Wisconsin WI\n- West Virginia WV\n- Wyoming WY\n\nDisclaimer:\nWe are not associated with any DMV.

When you trade derivatives, you will not own or have any rights to the underlying asset (e.g. you will not have the right to receive dividend payments in relation to Share CFDs). Trading derivatives may not be suitable for all investors and you should seek independent advice if necessary. You should also read our PDS, FSG and Terms and Conditions and other legal documents available at [www.vantagemarkets.com] and ensure that you fully understand the risks involved before deciding to acquire any of our products."

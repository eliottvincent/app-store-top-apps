      "label": "The Bitcoin.com Wallet, trusted by millions, is an easy-to-use, multichain, self-custodial crypto wallet that puts you in full control of all your crypto holdings.\n\nIt allows you to:\n\n- Buy Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), and select ERC-20 tokens quickly and easily via credit card, Apple Pay, and more.\n- Sell BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, and select ERC-20 tokens into your local currency (in select regions).\n- Send, receive, and swap between BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, USDT, USDC, and a huge range of ERC-20 tokens.\n- Access DeFi apps that enable use cases like earning interest on your crypto, borrowing and lending, participating in NFT marketplaces, synthetic assets, and more.\n\nOther key features include:\n\nSELF-CUSTODIAL\n\nYour cryptoassets are ultra-secure because only you can access them. Self-custodial means not even Bitcoin.com has access to your funds, and you can easily port your assets to another crypto wallet whenever you want. No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password. Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

Once there, the app has the ability to automatically fill in the information required .  Once the balance is retrieved, you’d push the button to update the balance and your data is recorded.\n\nPlease note that the application only stores data locally.

      "label": "Welcome to OK. OMNI Kredi is an app allowing users to set up their accounts with the ability to send and receive credit with OMNI a virtual property created by OMNI NOVAS Groups LLC. OMNI Kredi is working as an online service that allows people, whether they are living abroad or not, to send OMNI as a credit to their family and friends in Haiti. Likewise, Haitians living in Haiti can send OMNI as a credit to their families and friends abroad as well. Online shoppers can also use the OMNI Kredi service to have their own debit card or credit card for online shopping in any country. Debit and credit card services are not yet available but will come soon. They can reload their accounts with OMNI. The recipient can receive the credits in OMNI. 1 OMNI equals $ 1 US. Therefore, the amount of OMNI the people have on their account is also the number of dollars they literally have. They can, perhaps, withdraw their OMNIs in dollars. However, OMNI is not a cryptocurrency. OMNI is a virtual property that people can exchange with others for all transactions that in real life are not prohibited by the law.\nWith OMNI Kredi, people can send or withdraw their credit in US dollars when they sell their OMNIs to an agent. People abroad can pay credit for their Haitian beloved ones as well. Moreover, people from Haiti can pay credit lines in the name of those living abroad. Therefore, they can pay off credit for each other. What do we need to know between credit and loan? Credit is not a loan. A loan is more of a secured transaction than a short-term credit. OK agents are third-party partners who are there to secure such transactions. OMNI NOVAS Groups, LLC is just operating the system.\nWhether they are sending or receiving the credit, they must both, sender and receiver, have the app to make the transactions. Agents must also have the app. For owners of phones that are not running on iOS, they will only provide the agents with their phone numbers so that the agents can use their own phones to help them make transactions. Users are only giving the agent # their phone number but they have to put the PIN that OMNI Kredi sent them in the SMS. In this updated version, you as a user can still send or withdraw your OMNI and sell this virtual property in US dollars to an agent. Now, from the login page, you can find support on WhatsApp. Other support like live video calls, sending emails, live chat, calling our office in Miami, etc. are in the app. It is also translated into Ayisyen (Haitian Creole), French, and Spanish. You can now receive OTP by SMS and also SMS notifications for any type of transaction. You can share the app too."

Performing well on Spending Trivia demonstrates that you understand your spending and increases your 'Smart Score', which helps to unlock additional app functionality.\n\nWithin a few days of starting Smart Spend, you will notice your spending habits begin to change. You'll start to internalize the costs of your everyday purchases. In a few weeks, you'll be cutting excessive spending and saving more than you ever thought possible!\n\nAPP FEATURES:\n~ Get a reality check of how much your purchases really cost-- in your own terms\n~ See how much money you can save in the long run by cutting certain purchases\n~ Analyze your spending in new ways with powerful search/filter capabilities\n~ Widgets for iOS 14+ users\n~ Use Siri to enter your purchases\n~ Import purchases from .csv files produced by your bank and other budgeting apps\n~ Earn trophies as your spending habits get better\n~ Customizable daily spending notifications sent each evening\n~ Select from a variety of common currencies\n~ Earn points as you learn about your spending habits\n~ Special mode for users who only have a small amount of money until pay\n~ Set temporary 'MicroBudgets' to challenge yourself\n~ 'Cash Pool' offers a new way to integrate your regular income with your more unpredictable income\n\nWe've optimized the app over time to fit the needs of many unique financial situations that are often overlooked by other apps, including\n~ Only a small amount of funds available now  --> 'Last Mile' Mode\n~ Lack of steady funds and non-recurring payments  --> 'Cash Pool'\n~ Situations where you want to set your own spending budget (ie vacation/corporate travel) --> Cash Pool/MicroBudget Mode\n\nPrivacy and Philosophy: We pride ourselves on keeping your personal data on your device! We don’t ask for email, last name, bank account login. Our budgeting mindset is old school and effective because YOU simply have to put in the work. You can’t gain muscle without exercise. Developing better spending habits requires practice and repetition. You put in the elbow grease and we’ll use technology, psychology and economics to help you meet your goals.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://smartspendapp.com/privacy\nUser Agreement: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit.

With FXPaL you calculate Forex risks, pip value, identify the best lot size, and set strategic stop-loss or take-profit levels.\n\nWhat you get from FXPaL:\n\n*PROFIT CALCULATOR - Know immediately your potential profit and if a trade is worth it or not. Input different entry and closing prices to compare outcomes.\n\n*POSITION SIZE CALCULATOR - an intuitive design and user-friendly interface, with just a few simple inputs, you can identify the estimated amount of currency units to buy or sell to minimize the probable risk of loss per position.\n\n*STOP LOSS / TAKE PROFIT CALCULATOR - Quickly see exact profit and risk figures and easily identify stop-loss or take-profit rates based on the minimum amount you want to gain and the maximum amount you are willing to lose.\n\n*MARGIN CALCULATOR - Critical tool for traders. It keeps you from exceeding your trading account balance. Calculate the amount needed to guarantee the trading position you want to open based on the trade size and account leverage.\n\n*PIP VALUE CALCULATOR - Helps you know the actual value/price of a pip for any Forex traded currencies. Learn the value of pips based on the currency pair (major, minor, exotic) and the trade size of your trading position. This is a convenient tool for accounts with or with currency pairs other than USD.\n\n*SWAP CALCULATOR - Calculate the swap rate or the cost of holding a Forex trading position open overnight. Swap fee is the interest rate differential between two traded currencies and depends on whether you are holding a short or long position. Just enter currency pair, trade size, swap long or short, and you will get the swap fee.\n\n*PIVOT POINTS CALCULATOR - Though the basis for Pivot Point is basic arithmetic, computing manually is often time-consuming. Having FXPaL is a huge advantage to quickly calculate pivot, support, and resistance levels. Just enter a currency pair, high price, low price, and close price, and you can easily gauge the overall sentiment and direction of the prevailing trend of the market.\n\n*FIBONACCI CALCULATORS - A powerful Forex tool in FXPaL that calculates Fibonacci retracement and extension. The Fibonacci values become the major support and resistance levels that help traders spot where price might stop and reverse. Once you have observed a trend, enter high and low price values for the desired range.\n\nGear up for your next Forex trade with FXPaL!"

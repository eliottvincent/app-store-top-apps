No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password.

(You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

There's no credit check required, and no personal information is shared with lenders until you've been approved for a loan. We also don't require any upfront fees or prepayments, so nothing is standing between you and getting the money you need when you need it.\nGet Started Now!\nWith our app, you can get a payday advance in as few as three minutes: no credit check, no waiting for approval—just instant cash when needed.\nMaterial Disclosure\nASAP Finance is an app that helps you connect with multiple lenders with a single application form.

You'll be matched with multiple lenders who can offer competitive rates and terms on quick money loans tailored to your unique needs. And if you have any questions about the process or the offers presented, our customer service representatives are available 24/7 via phone or chat.\nBad credit loans may be banned in your state. Check the payday lending laws in your state.\nIf you are looking for a bad credit loan, you need to find out whether or not they are legal where you live. Unfortunately, many states have outlawed these cash advance loans, so it's essential to do your research. Some states even have criminal penalties for lenders who offer these types of quick loans.\nIt is why you must know where you stand before taking out a same-day loan to avoid having criminal charges brought against you later on down the road.\nIf you have been searching for a loan, you have probably heard of ASAP Finance. With its wide range of loan products and fast approval time, it is easy to see why so many people choose to work with us.\n\nWhen you apply for a loan through our app, we will be able to approve you within several minutes. Our repayment terms are between 65 days and 48 months, depending on the amount of money you need. You can borrow amounts between $250 and $5,000.\nThe APR is a number that represents the total cost of borrowing money over one year. It includes your interest rate and any fees or other charges associated with borrowing money.\nWe offer loans with APRs ranging from 5.99% to 35.55%, depending on your credit score and other factors, such as whether you have collateral.\nYour annual percentage rate (APR) will depend on which lender you choose, but it's essential to know that we don't have any control over this decision. We're happy to help you find a lender who can offer you the best deal possible, but ultimately, it's up to them.\n\nPayday Advance – ASAP Finance doesn't partner with Cash App, Albert, Cleo, Branch, Even, Dave, Daily Pay, FloatMe, Earnin, Empower, Possible Finance, MoneyLion, Klover, Clover, or Brigit.\n\nRepresentative example\nIf you borrow $1,200, you will repay $1.314,46 within the loan term. Your loan, approved for six months, will cost you $114.46 in interest, with an APR of 32.00 %. Therefore, your estimated monthly payment will be $219.08.\n\nPayday cash advance loans are a great way to get the cash you need without worrying about credit checks and endless paperwork.\nWe'll give you the money you need in as little as 24 hours, so you can pay your bills, buy that new car, or enjoy life a little more.\nWhether you're trying to avoid bankruptcy or looking for a short-term loan, download this money loan app now, apply, and we will help you find a suitable direct lender!"

Check Writer Basic will automatically generate the word amount so you do not have to worry about spelling it out. You can also print blank checks to take with you. \r\n\r\nKeep track of all your expenses and deposits with the built-in electronic record book (Register, up to 20 lines). Balance is calculated automatically. \r\n\r\nReconcile with your bank statement just as easily as you would with a paper record book. Save, load data and settings to use different accounts. Set different fonts to print your name on checks.\r\n\r\nCheck Writer Basic will sign your checks automatically with your own picture. \r\n\r\nYou can add your logo next to your name and address.\r\n\r\nAll elements of the check can be moved to perfectly fit your needs, and you can decide which elements will be printed (convenient for pre-printed paper). \r\n\r\nPrint as many blank checks as you want to use them like regular checkbooks.\r\n\r\nExtremely accurate MICR E13B technology is used to print special characters at the bottom of checks so they are recognized by bank processing. This font is used daily by regional and nationals banks.\r\n\r\nThe Register can be printed in spreadsheet format. Search easily throughout the register content: date, number, memo, amount.\r\n\r\nPrint in the middle of page (the full version would print on top, middle and bottom, as well as 3 checks per page). Checks can be printed on regular letter-size paper, plain white or color, as well as on professional looking check refill paper available from fine office supply stores. Also, Versacheck #1000, #1001, #1002, #3000, and Personal # 3001.\r\n\r\nQuickBooks® or Quicken® paper stock can be used as well. Likewise, using the Blank Checks feature without lines, you can print check paper for QuickBooks® and Quicken®\r\n\r\nThe height of checks can be set in Preferences, to accommodate non standard pre-printed paper.\r\n\r\nPrinting can be nudged horizontally and vertically very precisely."

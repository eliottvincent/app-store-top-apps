That way you'll always know if you're spending much more than you're earning or if you're in control of spending.\n\nWhat is 55/10/10/10/15?\nIt is a financial control methodology where all monthly income (tax deducted) is distributed to 5 different destinations. They are Essential Expenses (55%), Leisure (10%), Education (10%), Short/Medium Term Goals (10%) and, finally, Financial Freedom (15%).\n\nRegister your recipes.\nThe Bugeto App will distribute your income in the 5 portfolios of the 55/10/10/10/15 methodology. With this you will control and record each expense made in your wallet. The amounts distributed must be used according to the description of each portfolio.\n\nRecord your expenses.\nThe Bugeto App will deduct all reported expenses from the respective selected wallet. Thus, you will have control over the budget of each wallet and will know if you are spending more than what is available in your budget.\n\nEssential Expenses (55% of total income)\n55% of all your income should be used for your essential expenses. Essential Expenses are all those indispensable for your life. As an example, we can mention the costs of food, housing, transportation, day-to-day bills, credit card bills, children's school fees, etc. If any expense is essential for your life, it must be included within your essential expenses.\n\nLeisure (10% of total income)\nIt is recommended that you spend 10% of your monthly income on leisure activities. Leisure expenses include any expenses that are extra to essential expenses that bring you joy and happiness. This part of your budget is carte blanche to spend on anything that isn't essential but that you enjoy purchasing or consuming.\n\nEducation (10% of total income)\nIt is recommended that you spend 10% of your monthly income on your education. It is important to invest in education so that you can improve or acquire new skills. So you can increase your total income with your new knowledge and then increase all the amounts in your monthly budget.\n\nShort and Medium Term Goals (10% of total income)\nIt is recommended that you invest 10% of your monthly income in short- or medium-term goals (those you want to achieve within one to seven years). You should be able to invest this amount of money every month to make your dreams come true. This way you will always do them with advance planning and without last minute expenses.\n\nFinancial Freedom (15% of total income)\nIt is recommended that you invest 15% of your monthly income in your financial freedom. This is the money that will be responsible for forming passive income for you in the future. You will never spend it and you will always reinvest your earnings so that they increase more and more forming a snowball effect on your invested equity.\n\nAvailable in multiple languages.\nThe Bugeto App is available in many different languages. We are always updating the app to bring more and more new languages ​​to users.\n\nAvailable in multiple currencies.\nThe Bugeto App is available in several currencies from different countries. Frequent updates bring new coins to users.\n\nReady to get started?\nRemember to always register your income and also your expenses in the Bugeto App. Use the value of your wallets as indicated in each one. So you will surely achieve your financial prosperity.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://bugeto.crjlab.com/privacy"

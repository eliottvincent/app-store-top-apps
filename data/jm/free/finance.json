      "label": "The Bitcoin.com Wallet, trusted by millions, is an easy-to-use, multichain, self-custodial crypto wallet that puts you in full control of all your crypto holdings.\n\nIt allows you to:\n\n- Buy Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), and select ERC-20 tokens quickly and easily via credit card, Apple Pay, and more.\n- Sell BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, and select ERC-20 tokens into your local currency (in select regions).\n- Send, receive, and swap between BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, USDT, USDC, and a huge range of ERC-20 tokens.\n- Access DeFi apps that enable use cases like earning interest on your crypto, borrowing and lending, participating in NFT marketplaces, synthetic assets, and more.\n\nOther key features include:\n\nSELF-CUSTODIAL\n\nYour cryptoassets are ultra-secure because only you can access them. Self-custodial means not even Bitcoin.com has access to your funds, and you can easily port your assets to another crypto wallet whenever you want. No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password. Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

Right now the pros are finding ways to invest their crypto on the blockchain and earn interest on their favorite tokens. It’s a difficult process with a lot of steps, and has been too hard for most people to access - until now.\nSo easy your parents can do it\n\nWe’ll keep you on the right track and moving forward with financial growth. Giddy takes care of the hard stuff so you can spend time doing the things you love.\n\nWorld Class Security\nOur expertise in security puts you in good hands. You don’t have to keep track of long seed phrases or worry about losing a private key. We’ve got you covered.\n\nUltra Low Fees\nWe’re on the same team. When you succeed, we succeed. We don’t take huge fees any time you want to move your money around. We pass along the rewards of crypto investing to you.\n\nGiddy’s mission is to make crypto investing as easy and rewarding as possible. Here is some of the tech that sets us apart:\n\nDeFi\nMaybe you’ve heard this term floating around. It stands for Decentralized Finance and it’s the idea that we don’t need middlemen like banks eating up all the profits. With the power of blockchain technology, we can all benefit from a more efficient system and reap the rewards of putting our money to work.\nUntil now, participating in DeFi has been extremely technical and difficult for most people. Giddy takes care of all that complexity and delivers an easy-to-use experience so that anyone can get into the game.\n\nPrivate Keys\nWith our revolutionary decentralized private key security solution, you get to hold your money without having to keep track of a 24 word seed phrase on your own. Your keys, your crypto.\n\nGas Fees\nNormally, transacting in crypto requires you to set aside a portion of your crypto to pay for network fees. These gas fees can easily trip you up and can cost hundreds (!!) of dollars for a single transaction. With Giddy you no longer need to worry about gas fees. Our tech enables you to invest with no hassle.\n\nSmart Contract Approval\nWhen going it alone in the land of DeFi, it is easy to make a mistake that can cost you all of your crypto. Giddy to the rescue. We ensure that you approve the exact right amount of crypto for each transaction and then expire that approval so you’re not left with vulnerable loose ends.\nWe are at an inflection point in history. Traditional banking and finance is being turned upside down. For the first time, regular people can have access to markets which were previously only available to the super rich. Don’t get stuck in the past with low returns and high fees. Let Giddy be your guide to getting ahead.\n\n\nPlease reach out to the team at any time\n\n\nsupport@giddy.co"

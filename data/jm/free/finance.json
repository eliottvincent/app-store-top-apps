You can monitor multiple real-time quotes at once, not just one at a time like other financial apps. You can easily build multiple watch lists and quickly switch between them. Thoughtful features like multi-touch chart browsing are built to let you get quotes and charts with minimal taps and swipes.\n\nBest of all, Real-Time Stocks app is FREE, no matter who your broker is. After all, you are not subscribing to a financial data service. This app is not a trading platform. You don't need an account with any broker to have access to the app. No login required. No security issues.\n\n=== Features ===\n* Display real-time quotes/charts for most US stocks. Don't settle for 20-minute delays.\n* Auto-refresh stock quotes every 30 seconds, or press refresh button any time.\n* Create your own watch lists to monitor multiple stocks in real time.\n* Tap any index/stock symbol for its intraday chart, real-time whenever available.\n* Support Multi-touch for fast chart browsing. Horizontal swipes to iterate stocks in the same watchlist; vertical swipes to change time frames for historical charts.\n* Support indices of global markets.\n* Support many non-US stock exchanges with delayed quotes.\n* Display real-time charts, whenever available, for non-US exchanges including TSX, ASX, FTSE, Xetra and many others.\n* Avoid any account login.\n* Simple and clean interface.\n\n=== How to add stocks in non-US exchanges ===\n* Use Yahoo Finance to find symbols of your stocks. The app will take care of all the conversions. Examples for some non-US stock symbols are: rim.to, vod.l, bmw.de, san.pa, rio.ax, 0001.hk, c31.si.\n* This app does not have real-time quoting support for non-US stock exchanges. However, the app displays real-time intraday stock charts for many non-US stock exchanges whenever available. More coverage will come in future updates.\n\n=== Important ===\nThis app is for your personal informational purposes only. Consult your broker to verify stock prices before any trade. Trade with care and your own responsibility."

      "label": "Lite version of the Debt Strategy paid application. Limited to 2 debts.\n*****\n\nDebt Strategy helps you identify the best payoff strategy in order to pay down your debts fast. It also helps you track and pay off your debts, and execute on the strategy you choose. After entering your debts in the application, you can analyze how the choice of payment strategy or different extra amounts helps you pay off your debts sooner, and save on the total interest paid.  Debt Strategy supports multiple strategies such as:\n\n- Minimum Payments Only\n- Lowest Balances First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n- Highest Interest Rate First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n\nDebt Strategy helps you to take control of your debts. Pick one debt, either one with the lowest balance or one with the highest interest rate, and focus on paying it off first by paying a little more than the minimum. This will shave months off your debt. With your other debts, continue paying just the minimum. After you finish paying off the first debt, move on to the 2nd debt per your strategy. Roll over the amount you paid each month from your first debt to pay off this one. You will pay off the second debt even more quickly. Continue this strategy until all your debts are paid.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Ability to enter debts and track debts.\n- Ability to identify the best pay-off strategy, and perform what-if analysis with different additional amounts and pay-off strategies\n- Graphical view of how the debts will be paid off\n- Pie/Bar charts for debt break down by category, or remaining balance\n- Monthly payment schedule for each debt\n- Ability to enter payments during the life of the loan, and accurately track remaining balances\n- Payment reminders so you can make your payments on time\n- Ability to override the home currency\n- Option to email a report\n- Password protection"

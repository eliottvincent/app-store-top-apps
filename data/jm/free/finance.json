Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

Tap on it to close or delete the debt. A closed card will disappear but it will appear in History. When your colleague returns his half debt? Click 'Repayment' and enter the amount. The 'Delete' button does not put the debt in History.\n\nYou can customize the colors of the cards and the arrangement of elements on it. If you want to see a note of the debt, then select the template in the settings. If you want to apply the template to only one debt, select the corresponding item in the context menu.\n\nSelect debtor - this is a required field. To do this, select a contact from the phone book or enter a name. The name on the card opens the debts of a particular user. Here you can see the history of closed debts.\n\nThe notes will remind you of the circumstances of the debt: a colleague paid you the lunch or took money for a taxi. To add a note, swipe left to enter the amount. On the card, instead of the creation date, you can show a note - go to settings and select a card template.\n\nIdentification will protect your data from unwanted access.

Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit.

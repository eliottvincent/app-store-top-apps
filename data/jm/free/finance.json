Investors trade in the exchange rates of currencies like the Euro, the Dollar and the Pound. Forex is great because you can make profits every day. This Forex app will teach you how to make small amounts of money with the trade of currencies. \n\nWith Forex trading we use leverage, which is also called CFD. A Contract For Difference (CFD) is a contract between a buyer and a seller. They agree that the seller pays the difference between the opening price and the closing price. CFD is an investment instrument with a leverage function with which you, the investor, can make money with both rising and falling rates. Thanks to leverage, you can buy currency pairs for a multiple of the amount that you invest with CFD. \n\nThe Forex app consists of the following chapters:\n1.\tWhat is Forex?\n2.\tAn explanation of Forex rates\n3.\tHow do I fulfil a Forex position?\n4.\tAn Forex strategy for beginners\n5.\tRisk management\n6.\tPractical examples\n7.\tBrokers: getting started with Forex trade\n\nAfter you complete the Forex course you know what Forex is and how the currency market works. You can then invest independently in the exchange rate of a currency, use risk management tools and follow a Forex strategy. In order to get started with trading currency you can choose from a number of online brokers and begin directly with trading on exchange rates."

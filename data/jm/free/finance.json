Self-custodial means not even Bitcoin.com has access to your funds, and you can easily port your assets to another crypto wallet whenever you want. No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password. Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

      "label": "About BIN Number\n\nA bank identification number (BIN) is the initial six numbers that appear on a credit card. The bank identification number uniquely identifies the institution issuing the card. The BIN is key in the process of matching transactions to the issuer of the charge card.\n\nBank identification numbers are used by other institutions, such as American Express, as well. The term \"issuer identification number\" (IIN) is used interchangeably with BIN. The numbering system helps identify identity theft or potential security breaches by comparing data, such as the address of the institution issuing the card and the address of the cardholder.\n\nThe BIN quickly helps a merchant identify which bank the money is being transferred from, the address, and phone number of the bank, if the issuing bank is in the same country as the device used to make the transaction. The BIN verifies the address information provided by the customer.\n\nFeatures:\n- The BIN number allows merchants to accept multiple forms of payment and allows faster processing of transactions.\n- The number allows merchants to accept multiple forms of payment and allows transactions to be processed faster.\n- The card validator helps to know the type of the card. It includes Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Discover, Diner's Club, JCB, Maestro, Rupay, Mir, Elo, Hypercard, UnionPay\n- Card Validator doesn't store or transmit any of your full card details over the server or any analytical tools. This feature of card validator works locally on your device only.\n\nIt's a free app, and it has limited features until you subscribe to the premium plan. Under the free plan, there is a limit of only 5 Bin Checks,  thereafter you need to purchase the premium plan for unlimited Bin Checks. Along with that, you can see the History of all the last Bin Checks performed in the past. As a free user, validating cards would be free for a lifetime.\n\n-----\n\nPlease note that the application results are accurate but not perfect. The tool is provided for informational purposes only. Whilst every effort is made to provide accurate data, users must acknowledge that this app accepts no liability whatsoever with respect to its accuracy. Only your bank can confirm the correct bank account information. If you are making an important payment, which is time critical, we recommend to contact your bank first.\n\n-----\n\nBin Checker - Lite is free to download and use. However, if you’re looking to get the most, you can subscribe to our optional subscription product Go Premium.\n\nWe offer monthly and 1 year subscriptions. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice.

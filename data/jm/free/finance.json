Most successful traders understand this and choose to trade during times when market activity is high and avoid times when trading is light. Spreads are tighter during these periods and currency movements backed up by high trading volume are more likely to follow through.\n\nForex Hours provides a quick overview of the status and local time of major forex markets in the world. At those overlapping trading hours it is likely you will find the highest volume of trades and therefore more chances to win in the foreign currency exchange market.

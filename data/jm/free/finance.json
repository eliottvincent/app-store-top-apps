Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit.

Visa, MasterCard and American Express are supported, and you can also manually specify an unsupported card. \n\nRecently, the app has been updated to include fully automatic balance retrieval of:\nAccount Now\nGlobal Cash Card\n\n\nFor other prepaid cards, the app works by using your device to go to the appropriate website where the balance can be looked up.  Once there, the app has the ability to automatically fill in the information required .  Once the balance is retrieved, you’d push the button to update the balance and your data is recorded.\n\nPlease note that the application only stores data locally.  There is no transmission of sensitive information between you and our systems – you only communicate that with the credit card distributor.\n\nThere are hundreds of cards around, here are some we are aware of and are available within the app:\nAmerican Express\nAmerican Express (Serve)\nBluebird\nConsumer Card Access\nEspree Prepaid MasterCard\nGiftCards.com\nH&R Block Emerald\nHome Depot\nMetabank\nNetspend\nPayPower\nSimon\nUSBank Focus\nVanilla\nWalmart\n\nSome cards are better supported than others, we look to improve this in future releases."

And we are here to focus on your unique needs and serve you in the best possible manner.\n\nWALLET FEATURES:\n\n- Non-Custodial Multi-wallet >> Manage any number of cryptocurrencies across multiple portfolio-style wallets in a non-custodial manner. This wallet is like your own bank where you are the only client and the only one in charge. It’s designed to keep assets secure and easy to restore even if the phone is stolen and tampered with.\n- Investment Oriented Wallet >> Unstoppable brings unmatched cryptocurrency market analytics to your device: advanced sorting, curated categorization, extensive search filtering, and event-based alerting features.\n- Universal Wallet >> It supports all mainstream blockchains and is built in a standard compliant manner enabling users to use just one wallet app for everything crypto.\n- A Bitcoin Wallet >> The wallet packs some of the most advanced Bitcoin features available: SPV enabled, BIP 44/49/84/69 compliant, Bitcoin timelocks, custom transaction fees, and more.\n- A DeFi Wallet >> Full support for decentralized token swaps on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and more. Also, the ability to interact with any smart contract-powered service on the blockchain via the WalletConnect protocol.\n- Ethereum Wallet >> Full support for Ethereum blockchain, its growing ecosystem of tokens (ERC20, NFT tokens, etc.), and other decentralized services such as ENS (Ethereum Name Service).\n- Ethereum L2 Wallet >> Artbitrum, Optimism, Polygon support.\n- Avalanche Wallet >> Full support for Avalanche C-Chain blockchain.\n- Binance Wallet >> Full support for original Binance Chain (incl.

One of the very few wallets capable of supporting fully shielded Zcash transactions as well as the ability to privatize Bitcoin transactions.\n- Decentralized Wallet >> Designed to work with most major blockchains in a decentralized manner where an app doesn't depend on some server of a wallet provider to send/receive transactions but interacts with blockchain networks directly.\n- Privacy Focused >> Designed to allow for privacy even in the most privacy-breaching scenarios. There are no user accounts keeping your records, no identity checks that risk exposing your financials to the world, and no interaction with traditional finance layers. The app is partially TOR enabled and VPN support coming soon.\n- Fully Open Source >> The most transparent wallet application built to date. The entire 4-year production process of the app is openly accessible online along with 100% of its code for anyone to evaluate or reuse in other projects. Verified and audited by third parties.\n\nBe Unstoppable!"

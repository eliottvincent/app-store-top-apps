      "label": "The Ultimate Secret Menu for Starbucks!\n\nTired of the same old Starbucks? Discover new and exciting drinks, with 100’s of current recipes and new drinks added every week!\n\nWe have something for everyone - from current Pop Culture drinks, to new takes on favorites like the ‘TikTok Pink Drink’ to healthy choices like the ‘Healthy Passion’.\n\nUnique Features:\n\nPRO DRINKS:\nWe only use up to date recipes - no stale old content that has been sitting out there for years, with ingredients that don’t exist anymore. How do you know? Because we order each Secret Starbucks recipe and try it before taking our own photos and adding it to our App! Also, all of our drink recipes are reviewed and curated by real baristas who ensure that the recipes are going to taste great and are easy to order.\n\nDYNAMIC RECIPES: \nYou want your Secret Drink Tall, Grande or Venti? No problem! The recipe instantly adapts to the size you select directly at the recipe. That’s how we guarantee that you can always enjoy your secret drink, no matter which size you prefer.\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN FAVORITES LIST AND SAVE TIME:\nSimply add secret drinks to your personal \"favorite list\" to have all drinks you need in one place. With one tap you make sure that you will never forget your drinks or waste time searching for them again when ordering at Starbucks. Start today curating your own featured list like thousands already have.\n\nSPACE SAVING APP:\nTired of having no available space on your phone? Our App is smaller than the other Secret Menu Apps available. Of course we still give you access to hundreds of dynamic secret recipes that always include Photos and Ratings.\n\nPRO COMMUNITY:\nOur users are a key part of the experience - we know they are the true Starbucks fans. Whether submitting new recipes, connecting on our social media platforms, or creating new video content - we value your input. If there’s a way we can make the app better, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nEASY IN-APP Experience:\nUnlike some other apps out there, our app is built to provide an amazing user experience, with well designed navigation, categorization and search, a sleek modern interface, and quality original photography. The Best Secret Menu for Starbucks!\n\nPRO DEVELOPERS:\nWe’re a small indie app development company that strives to make beautiful apps that are a pleasure to use. Design Matters. Less is More. Enjoy.\n\nLEGAL:\nBuilt by fans, for fans - this mobile app provides an easy and convenient interface to view user submitted drink ideas from the global Starbucks community. While we extensively curate the content and do our best to maintain the accuracy of the recipes, some ingredients may no longer be available and therefore some recipes may not be available. PRO subscription does not guarantee 100% accuracy and availability of all recipes.\n\nWe do not represent or are associated in any way with the Starbucks Corporation. Starbucks Coffee Company, Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, and other Starbucks trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the app are trade names, trademarks or registered trademarks of Starbucks Corporation.\n\nPlease find our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use here: https://www.anthemventuresus.com/privacy-policy"

It’s simple yet complex in a good way. Great app. Recommended!\"\n\"MyFast is the best intermittent fasting tracker and weekly scheduler app available. It quickly guides you through the overall concept of fasting and will help you completely manage your fasting and eating windows. With over 200,000+ fast trackers, we are the most complete and trusted IF timer.\"\n\"Favorite app for tracking fasting / weight loss. I’m terrible at counting time and that’s the whole reason I have this app. I can set my goal by deciding I want to do an 18 hr fast and it tells me when to stop fasting. I can edit my goals on a daily basis when starting IF, OR set up a regular schedule. You can track water intake and weight loss and easily compare weight loss to fasting length on the same screen. Minimal, noninvasive ads and no required ‘plans’. I recommend this to everyone!”\nFeatures:\nSchedule out all your zero calorie fast and eating windows for the week and let the app timer run automatically with notifications telling you when to stop eating and when to start fasting.\nManual Mode: Choose a zero calorie fasting or eating window. Start and stop when you want. Edit all times, dates, goal length in real times.\nToday Widget\nEasily add, edit, delete, and .CSV export your completed fasts and body measurements like weight.\nVisualize and track your weight loss progress in the charts section.\nClock Format: Choose between 12 and 24 clock type and several different time display formats\nDate Format: Choose from several different local date formats to display throughout\nNotifications: Get notification reminders to fast every day, alerts for when your window is almost finished, and when it has completed.\nSimple, Clean, Minimalist, Clutter-Free Home Screen Timer\nUnlimited Fast Lengths\nMultiple Devices - Use your synced MyFast account on any device and never lose your data to an accident.\nExtra Tracking: Record water intake and other notes during your fast\nEnglish, Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese language options\nLearn Section – intermittent fasting book for beginners with all you need to know to become an IF expert\nWhat Is Intermittent Fasting?\nWhat usually comes to mind when most people hear of Intermittent Fasting (IF), is that it is just another crazy fad diet to lose weight with little effort. However, it isn't a diet at all, but rather an eating pattern. It’s not what you eat, but when you eat it that is important.\nDepending on what type of fasting you schedule, you generally will have a time window where you are allowed to eat all the food you want. As soon as that window is over though, you don't eat ANYTHING until the window comes up again. For example, a common approach is 16 hour fasts with an 8 hour eating window every day.\nThere are dozens of different type of fasting diets, and with MyFast you can utilize any plan such as:\n16/8 - Lean Gains\n5:2 - Eat normal for 5 days, and IF the remaining 2\n20/4 – The Warriot Diet\n24/0 – Full Day or Alternative Day Diet\nAlternative Day Diet - (every other day you will be fasting for 24 hours.)\nAny other zero calorie fasting plan you can think of is possible\nMyFast can be used free of charge, and within the app, you can choose to buy a subscription. With Subscription you can all premium features. Subscription renews automatically and charges to your iTunes Account. Subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of a period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of a period. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings after purchase.\nTerms of Services: https://myfasttracker.com/terms-and-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://myfasttracker.com/page-privacy"

Quickly search for a food (eggs, chicken, strawberries, anything!) and feel confident in exactly how to prepare it for baby.\n\nWith a paid subscription, you can record baby's progress with a digital food log, track baby's favorite foods, make a list of foods you'd like to try later, and track any foods baby has had a reaction to which you can share with doctors and caregivers.  \n\nThis app will be a crucial tool to help you to raise a healthy, happy eater, avoid picky eating, and enjoy family meals!"

After tasting this deliciously smooth vodka, you will understand why Medea is the recipient of multiple awards.\n\nMedea’s patented LED technology allows the user to program the bottle with a personalized message. The first response the Medea bottle evokes is \"Wow!\". As the world’s first personally programmable bottle, it is the perfect gift for any occasion. Give a gift of Medea Vodka and watch someone’s face light up!\n\nThe Medea app allows you to share your LED display with other people nearby. This feature requires you to grant the Medea app location services.\n\nNote:\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Цены и выбор — как в магазине у дома.\n\nАКЦИИ\nМы проводим акции и каждый день обновляем скидки на продукты и напитки. Например, промокод SM100 даёт скидку 100 ₽ на три первых заказа. Акция действует, если оформить доставку продуктов на дом от 800 ₽.\n\nГОРОДА\nМосква, Санкт-Петербург, Альметьевск, Барнаул, Белгород, Брянск, Великий Новгород, Владимир, Волгоград, Воронеж, Екатеринбург, Ижевск, Казань, Калуга, Кемерово, Киров, Коломна, Краснодар, Красноярск, Курск, Липецк, Магнитогорск, Набережные Челны, Нижнекамск, Нижний Новгород, Нижний Тагил, Новокузнецк, Новосибирск, Новочебоксарск, Ногинск, Омск, Оренбург, Орехово-Зуево, Орёл, Пенза, Пермь, Ростов-на-Дону, Рязань, Самара, Саратов, Ставрополь, Стерлитамак, Таганрог, Тамбов, Тверь, Тольятти, Томск, Тула, Тюмень, Ульяновск, Уфа, Чебоксары, Челябинск, Череповец, Энгельс и Ярославль.\n\nБЫСТРО\nДоставим продукты на дом за 15–30 минут. Так быстро, потому что в каждом районе свой даркстор. Даркстор похож на продуктовый магазин: внутри полки с продуктами и холодильники, а вместо покупателей — сборщики. Заказ собирают за 2–3 минуты, а затем передают курьерам. Они развозят их по району на велосипедах.\n\nКАК В МАГАЗИНЕ У ДОМА\nУ нас есть:\n+ готовая еда\n+ овощи и фрукты\n+ крупы, макароны и консервы\n+ мясо и птица\n+ замороженная еда\n+ молоко, яйца и масло\n+ хлеб и выпечка\n+ сыры\n+ колбаса и сосиски\n+ рыба и морепродукты\n+ чай и кофе\n+ вода, лимонады и соки\n+ сладкое\n+ мороженое\n+ чипсы\n+ безалкогольное пиво и вино\n+ веганские продукты и напитки\n+ товары и продукты из других стран\n+ товары для детей\n+ товары для животных\n+ шампуни и гели для душа\n+ товары для дома\n+ косметика и средства для ухода\n\nВСЁ СВЕЖЕЕ\nДва раза в день наши сотрудники проверяют срок годности товаров и внешний вид фруктов и овощей. В холодильниках в дарксторе мы поддерживаем температуру 2–4 °С, в морозильных камерах −18 °С.\n\nОТ САМОКАТА\nУ нас есть своя марка, под ней мы выпускаем продукты и товары для дома. Сами ищем производителей — больших и маленьких. Общаемся с ними и выбираем тех, кто по-настоящему любит и знает своё дело. Весь список продуктов проверяем на безопасность в лабораториях и пробуем сами.\n\nСУПЕРМАРКЕТ\nУ нас есть Супермаркет. Это большой магазин, в котором в два раза больше всего. Например, там есть бытовая техника, экзотические фрукты и большие пачки корма для питомцев. Удобно, чтобы закупиться сразу на неделю. Время доставки — от 15 минут до 1,5 часа.\n\nБЬЮТИ\nВ Москве работает Бьюти. Загляните, там много интересного: от корейских масок до салонной косметики для волос. Бренды — как масс-маркет, так и нишевые, много органических марок. Доставка в день заказа.\n\nМЕДИА\nВ приложении выходит много контента: рецепты, советы экспертов, обзоры продуктов и косметики, гиды по ингредиентам. Наша цель — развлекать, вдохновлять и быть полезными.\n\nГДЕ НАС ИСКАТЬ\nВКонтакте — vk.com/samokat_15min\nТелеграм — t.me/samokatwithlove\nТелеграм Бьюти — t.me/samokat_beauty"

      "label": "\"I tried a handful of fasting apps for my intermittent fasting life and none of them was the right one for me. I then tried this one and it’s been the one I have stuck with. It’s simple yet complex in a good way. Great app. Recommended!\"\n\"MyFast is the best intermittent fasting tracker and weekly scheduler app available. It quickly guides you through the overall concept of fasting and will help you completely manage your fasting and eating windows. With over 200,000+ fast trackers, we are the most complete and trusted IF timer.\"\n\"Favorite app for tracking fasting / weight loss. I’m terrible at counting time and that’s the whole reason I have this app. I can set my goal by deciding I want to do an 18 hr fast and it tells me when to stop fasting. I can edit my goals on a daily basis when starting IF, OR set up a regular schedule. You can track water intake and weight loss and easily compare weight loss to fasting length on the same screen. Minimal, noninvasive ads and no required ‘plans’. I recommend this to everyone!”\nFeatures:\nSchedule out all your zero calorie fast and eating windows for the week and let the app timer run automatically with notifications telling you when to stop eating and when to start fasting.\nManual Mode: Choose a zero calorie fasting or eating window. Start and stop when you want. Edit all times, dates, goal length in real times.\nToday Widget\nEasily add, edit, delete, and .CSV export your completed fasts and body measurements like weight.\nVisualize and track your weight loss progress in the charts section.\nClock Format: Choose between 12 and 24 clock type and several different time display formats\nDate Format: Choose from several different local date formats to display throughout\nNotifications: Get notification reminders to fast every day, alerts for when your window is almost finished, and when it has completed.\nSimple, Clean, Minimalist, Clutter-Free Home Screen Timer\nUnlimited Fast Lengths\nMultiple Devices - Use your synced MyFast account on any device and never lose your data to an accident.\nExtra Tracking: Record water intake and other notes during your fast\nEnglish, Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese language options\nLearn Section – intermittent fasting book for beginners with all you need to know to become an IF expert\nWhat Is Intermittent Fasting?\nWhat usually comes to mind when most people hear of Intermittent Fasting (IF), is that it is just another crazy fad diet to lose weight with little effort. However, it isn't a diet at all, but rather an eating pattern. It’s not what you eat, but when you eat it that is important.\nDepending on what type of fasting you schedule, you generally will have a time window where you are allowed to eat all the food you want. As soon as that window is over though, you don't eat ANYTHING until the window comes up again. For example, a common approach is 16 hour fasts with an 8 hour eating window every day.\nThere are dozens of different type of fasting diets, and with MyFast you can utilize any plan such as:\n16/8 - Lean Gains\n5:2 - Eat normal for 5 days, and IF the remaining 2\n20/4 – The Warriot Diet\n24/0 – Full Day or Alternative Day Diet\nAlternative Day Diet - (every other day you will be fasting for 24 hours.)\nAny other zero calorie fasting plan you can think of is possible\nMyFast can be used free of charge, and within the app, you can choose to buy a subscription. With Subscription you can all premium features. Subscription renews automatically and charges to your iTunes Account. Subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of a period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of a period. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings after purchase.\nTerms of Services: https://myfasttracker.com/terms-and-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://myfasttracker.com/page-privacy"

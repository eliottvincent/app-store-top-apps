Quickly search for a food (eggs, chicken, strawberries, anything!) and feel confident in exactly how to prepare it for baby.\n\nWith a paid subscription, you can record baby's progress with a digital food log, track baby's favorite foods, make a list of foods you'd like to try later, and track any foods baby has had a reaction to which you can share with doctors and caregivers.  \n\nThis app will be a crucial tool to help you to raise a healthy, happy eater, avoid picky eating, and enjoy family meals!"

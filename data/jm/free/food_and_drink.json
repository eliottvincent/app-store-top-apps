Organic, gluten free, and all natural ingredients are important to us!\n\nSpeaking of decisions and life choices…. As each of our lives are ever changing, so is our menu. Our offerings speak of a place and time, the thrill and delight that a moment gives us with family, friends, loved ones, and experiences. In order to do so, our menu making decisions are dictated by what happens in our lives and the season we are in. \n\nLike a new relationship, season, or new year our menu will continue to change and our hope is for you to follow our story, share yours, and connect with us so that we can cheers each other in passing while doing this thing called life."

With a community-curated approach, you can take those pages of results and find not the best place, but the best place FOR YOU. Are you a gluten-free, vegan, with a dog, child and an affinity for margaritas? Me neither (except for the margaritas part) but if you were, you'd be able to find your place quickly using community filters. After you found it, verify with the video shorts to experience the place before deciding. \n\nRight now our most active communities are:\n- Vegan / Vegetarian\n- Kid / Dog Friendly\n- Wifi / Power Plug Cafes\n- Karaoke spots\n- Darts, pool table\n- Penn State bars\n\nHate those? Spin up your own, recruit your friends and start mapping places you all can trust. \n\nNot looking for anything in particular? Browse some videos and save places to your own saved places lists. This will come in handy and you'll be the most prepared with comments like - \"Oh the spot across the street has really good ahi tuna tacos according to my foodie friend Frank.\"\n\nWant to add content? Awesome! We love content creators and are working hard to show the impact of your content. Soon we should be able to let creators know how many visits they drove from the content, showcasing all the success your content is generating for local businesses..\n\nI want to be honest with y'all though. This is V1 of many, its rough around the edges and has a bit of work to do. Before bashing us on here pop over to https://www.reddit.com/r/whimwe/ and throw in some bugs, feedback, issues.\n\nI hope you see the potential of this and have as much fun using it as I did building it!"

      "label": "\"I tried a handful of fasting apps for my intermittent fasting life and none of them was the right one for me. I then tried this one and it’s been the one I have stuck with. It’s simple yet complex in a good way. Great app. Recommended!\"\n\"MyFast is the best intermittent fasting tracker and weekly scheduler app available. It quickly guides you through the overall concept of fasting and will help you completely manage your fasting and eating windows.

I can edit my goals on a daily basis when starting IF, OR set up a regular schedule. You can track water intake and weight loss and easily compare weight loss to fasting length on the same screen. Minimal, noninvasive ads and no required ‘plans’. I recommend this to everyone!”\nFeatures:\nSchedule out all your zero calorie fast and eating windows for the week and let the app timer run automatically with notifications telling you when to stop eating and when to start fasting.\nManual Mode: Choose a zero calorie fasting or eating window.

However, it isn't a diet at all, but rather an eating pattern. It’s not what you eat, but when you eat it that is important.\nDepending on what type of fasting you schedule, you generally will have a time window where you are allowed to eat all the food you want. As soon as that window is over though, you don't eat ANYTHING until the window comes up again. For example, a common approach is 16 hour fasts with an 8 hour eating window every day.\nThere are dozens of different type of fasting diets, and with MyFast you can utilize any plan such as:\n16/8 - Lean Gains\n5:2 - Eat normal for 5 days, and IF the remaining 2\n20/4 – The Warriot Diet\n24/0 – Full Day or Alternative Day Diet\nAlternative Day Diet - (every other day you will be fasting for 24 hours.)\nAny other zero calorie fasting plan you can think of is possible\nMyFast can be used free of charge, and within the app, you can choose to buy a subscription. With Subscription you can all premium features. Subscription renews automatically and charges to your iTunes Account. Subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of a period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of a period.

      "label": "Found a recipe on the internet that looks great? Yum! Add it to Whisk and start creating your personal cookbook. Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com. We want to make sure your Whisk experience is the best it can be!"

The promise: Taste improvement after one dinner with Zest.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS\nWe've all tried cooking a TikTok recipe. You rewatch the video 13 times to figure out what the hell is going on. Zest embeds videos throughout recipes so you can click into content when you need it. No more pausing and restarting. Learn at your own pace.\n \nCONCEPT VIDEOS\nWatch a short video on a new concept at your own pace and then cook recipes that reinforce what you've learned. We dive into topics like the science of tasting and the basics of seasoning, sautéing, roasting and more!\n\nSKILL VIDEOS\nDon't know how to dice an onion? Don't be embarrassed, we got you covered. Skill videos are linked in each recipe to guide you along, so you don't have to watch Gordon Ramsey on YouTube (we love his accent too).\n\nCURATED MENU\nChoose a menu to fit your preferences. Tired of wasting produce? Search for dishes including what’s already in your fridge. Got allergies? Compile safe recipes in your menu to find them when you’re ready to get cooking. \n\nGROCERY LIST\nShop your menu with our automated grocery list. Plus, utilize our helpful tips while you shop. Don't know what a neutral oil is? We got you covered.\n\nPERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS\nRate the recipes you cook, so we can recommend similar ones.\n\nFeedback? Technical Issues? Killer ideas you want to contribute to make our app better? Email us at support@zestapp.co. We're always here to help and would love to chef up new ideas together!\n\nEnd User Licensing Agreement: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

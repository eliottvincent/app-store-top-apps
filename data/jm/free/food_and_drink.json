Sie ist lediglich als Entscheidungshilfe für Personen mit \"Halal\"-Sensibilität gedacht, diese durch Informationen hinsichtlich der Herkunft und Bezug der Lebensmittel in die Lage zu versetzen, sich ein eigenes Bild und eine eigene Meinung über die \"Halal\"-Konformität zu bilden.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllgemein anerkannte Verfahren und Prozesse sowie aufsichtsrechtliche Überprüfungen von sog. \"HALAL\"-Zertifizierungen sind nicht vorhanden. Verbraucher wie Unternehmer, die \"Halal\"-Lebensmittel konsumieren bzw. vertreiben möchten, sind hier sehr oft auf eigene Recherchen oder nicht belegte Herkunfts-Angaben und Informationen angewiesen.\r\n\r\n\r\nDie \"Halal\"-Lebensmittel-App möchte zu einer größeren Transparenz in diesem Bereich beitragen. Unternehmer haben daher zusätzlich die Möglichkeit, sich über die App zu registrieren und Herkunftsnachweise (Rechnungen, Lieferscheine etc.) mittels der App hochzuladen, die über die App veröffentlicht werden.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsgesamt möchte die App auch zu einer größeren Sensibilisierung von muslimischen Verbrauchern zum Thema \"Clean Food\" beitragen, was in dem o.g. Vers unter \"erlaubt und gut/rein\" angelegt ist. Dieses Gebot wird seitens des Vereins als Auftrag verstanden, neben der Pflicht der Einhaltung von bestimmten Vorgaben zu Art und Weise der Herstellung (\"halal\") auch die ethisch-nachhaltige Seite (\"tayyiben\") der Lebensmittel zu hinterfragen."

Discover new and exciting drinks, with 100’s of current recipes and new drinks added every week!\n\nWe have something for everyone - from current Pop Culture drinks, to new takes on favorites like the ‘TikTok Pink Drink’ to healthy choices like the ‘Healthy Passion’.\n\nUnique Features:\n\nPRO DRINKS:\nWe only use up to date recipes - no stale old content that has been sitting out there for years, with ingredients that don’t exist anymore. How do you know? Because we order each Secret Starbucks recipe and try it before taking our own photos and adding it to our App! Also, all of our drink recipes are reviewed and curated by real baristas who ensure that the recipes are going to taste great and are easy to order.\n\nDYNAMIC RECIPES: \nYou want your Secret Drink Tall, Grande or Venti? No problem! The recipe instantly adapts to the size you select directly at the recipe. That’s how we guarantee that you can always enjoy your secret drink, no matter which size you prefer.\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN FAVORITES LIST AND SAVE TIME:\nSimply add secret drinks to your personal \"favorite list\" to have all drinks you need in one place. With one tap you make sure that you will never forget your drinks or waste time searching for them again when ordering at Starbucks. Start today curating your own featured list like thousands already have.\n\nSPACE SAVING APP:\nTired of having no available space on your phone? Our App is smaller than the other Secret Menu Apps available. Of course we still give you access to hundreds of dynamic secret recipes that always include Photos and Ratings.\n\nPRO COMMUNITY:\nOur users are a key part of the experience - we know they are the true Starbucks fans. Whether submitting new recipes, connecting on our social media platforms, or creating new video content - we value your input. If there’s a way we can make the app better, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nEASY IN-APP Experience:\nUnlike some other apps out there, our app is built to provide an amazing user experience, with well designed navigation, categorization and search, a sleek modern interface, and quality original photography. The Best Secret Menu for Starbucks!\n\nPRO DEVELOPERS:\nWe’re a small indie app development company that strives to make beautiful apps that are a pleasure to use. Design Matters. Less is More. Enjoy.\n\nLEGAL:\nBuilt by fans, for fans - this mobile app provides an easy and convenient interface to view user submitted drink ideas from the global Starbucks community. While we extensively curate the content and do our best to maintain the accuracy of the recipes, some ingredients may no longer be available and therefore some recipes may not be available. PRO subscription does not guarantee 100% accuracy and availability of all recipes.\n\nWe do not represent or are associated in any way with the Starbucks Corporation. Starbucks Coffee Company, Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, and other Starbucks trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the app are trade names, trademarks or registered trademarks of Starbucks Corporation.\n\nPlease find our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use here: https://www.anthemventuresus.com/privacy-policy"

This app will give your ever expecting result.\n\nBodybuilding exercises are conducive to making your body bigger and developing muscles. Bodybuilding, as enthusiasts of the sport will tell you, provides people with more energy, better sleep, overall better health, and even improved psychological moods. This is in addition to the obvious benefit of making you look better. Bodybuilding is also beneficial in that it is economical and accessible to even private bodybuilders who just like to work out in their home environment with no equipment. Doing bodybuilding exercises at home is just as useful as working out at the gym.\n\n\nEveryone knows exercise plays an important role in our general health, but whether its a lack of motivation, the need to travel to the gym, the cost of equipment, or simply know-how, these supposed obstacles often stand in our way.

No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends\n\nWhy purchase new ingredients when you can focus on what you already have?\n\nHere’s how it works:\n• For Supercook to do its magic, it needs to know all the ingredients you have at home.\n• Visit the pantry page in the SuperCook app and choose from a list of 2000+ ingredients broken down into categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, and many more. \n• Start adding ALL the ingredients you have at home to your SuperCook pantry – including oils, spices, and yes - even that old bottle of Worcestershire sauce in the back of the fridge!\n• Sit back and watch SuperCook work its magic by finding recipes that match your ingredients.\n\nSuperCook’s Unique App Features:\n \n--Customized Recipe Ideas--\nWe’ve consolidated over 11 million recipes from 18,000 recipe websites, in 20 languages to create the largest recipe collection ever.   This knowledge was fed into an AI system that learnt the intricacies of all ingredients and how they can be mixed together.\n\nAll you have to do is build your pantry on the app – and you’re ready to make delicious meals without ever leaving your house!\n\nSuperCook will find you any recipe you need, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a midnight snack.  \n\n--Easily Add Your Ingredients--\nSave time and money with an intelligent pantry. SuperCook’s voice dictation mode allows you to quickly add ingredients to your in-app pantry by simply saying them out loud.\n\nJust open your fridge, click the microphone button, and start listing everything inside. The app will automatically add the ingredients to your pantry for a quick and easy way to find recipes!\n \n--Automatic Recipe Recommendations--\nThe app will automatically find you recipes to make with what’s in your fridge – so all those lost ingredients in the back of your cupboard now have a place on your table.  It’s that simple!\n\nWhen you run out of an ingredient, simply open the SuperCook app and remove it from your pantry -  and all the recipe ideas will adjust accordingly.\n \n--Get Creative in the Kitchen--\nSuperCook inspires new ideas and activities in the kitchen for new cooks, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike.\n\nWith over 11 million recipes available in 20 different languages, SuperCook promises that you’ll never cook the same thing twice (unless you want to, of course!).\n\n--What's on the menu ?--\nThe menu page is where you'll find all your recipe ideas.  Why is it called menu?  Because just like the menu in a restaurant, everything on the menu page is available to you now.  SuperCook instantly analyzes 11 million recipes and finds the ones that match your unique ingredients.\n\nMost likely your menu page will contain thousands of recipes, but don't worry, we've broken them down into helpful categories like soups and stews, appetizers and snacks, salads, entrees, desserts and more.\n\n--Reduce food waste--\nMost people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. SuperCook is one of the best ways to reduce food waste in the home.   It finds recipes that use as many of your ingredients as possible, so nothing goes to waste.    SuperCook makes food waste prevention fun and easy, just open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe.   We help you use what you have, so nothing goes to waste!"

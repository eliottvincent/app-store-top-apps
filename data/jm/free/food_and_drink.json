No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends\n\nWhy purchase new ingredients when you can focus on what you already have?\n\nHere’s how it works:\n• For Supercook to do its magic, it needs to know all the ingredients you have at home.\n• Visit the pantry page in the SuperCook app and choose from a list of 2000+ ingredients broken down into categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, and many more. \n• Start adding ALL the ingredients you have at home to your SuperCook pantry – including oils, spices, and yes - even that old bottle of Worcestershire sauce in the back of the fridge!\n• Sit back and watch SuperCook work its magic by finding recipes that match your ingredients.\n\nSuperCook’s Unique App Features:\n \n--Customized Recipe Ideas--\nWe’ve consolidated over 11 million recipes from 18,000 recipe websites, in 20 languages to create the largest recipe collection ever.   This knowledge was fed into an AI system that learnt the intricacies of all ingredients and how they can be mixed together.\n\nAll you have to do is build your pantry on the app – and you’re ready to make delicious meals without ever leaving your house!\n\nSuperCook will find you any recipe you need, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a midnight snack.  \n\n--Easily Add Your Ingredients--\nSave time and money with an intelligent pantry. SuperCook’s voice dictation mode allows you to quickly add ingredients to your in-app pantry by simply saying them out loud.\n\nJust open your fridge, click the microphone button, and start listing everything inside. The app will automatically add the ingredients to your pantry for a quick and easy way to find recipes!\n \n--Automatic Recipe Recommendations--\nThe app will automatically find you recipes to make with what’s in your fridge – so all those lost ingredients in the back of your cupboard now have a place on your table.  It’s that simple!\n\nWhen you run out of an ingredient, simply open the SuperCook app and remove it from your pantry -  and all the recipe ideas will adjust accordingly.\n \n--Get Creative in the Kitchen--\nSuperCook inspires new ideas and activities in the kitchen for new cooks, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike.\n\nWith over 11 million recipes available in 20 different languages, SuperCook promises that you’ll never cook the same thing twice (unless you want to, of course!).\n\n--What's on the menu ?--\nThe menu page is where you'll find all your recipe ideas.  Why is it called menu?  Because just like the menu in a restaurant, everything on the menu page is available to you now.  SuperCook instantly analyzes 11 million recipes and finds the ones that match your unique ingredients.\n\nMost likely your menu page will contain thousands of recipes, but don't worry, we've broken them down into helpful categories like soups and stews, appetizers and snacks, salads, entrees, desserts and more.\n\n--Reduce food waste--\nMost people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. SuperCook is one of the best ways to reduce food waste in the home.   It finds recipes that use as many of your ingredients as possible, so nothing goes to waste.    SuperCook makes food waste prevention fun and easy, just open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe.   We help you use what you have, so nothing goes to waste!"

      "label": "\"I tried a handful of fasting apps for my intermittent fasting life and none of them was the right one for me. I then tried this one and it’s been the one I have stuck with. It’s simple yet complex in a good way. Great app. Recommended!\"\n\"MyFast is the best intermittent fasting tracker and weekly scheduler app available. It quickly guides you through the overall concept of fasting and will help you completely manage your fasting and eating windows. With over 200,000+ fast trackers, we are the most complete and trusted IF timer.\"\n\"Favorite app for tracking fasting / weight loss. I’m terrible at counting time and that’s the whole reason I have this app. I can set my goal by deciding I want to do an 18 hr fast and it tells me when to stop fasting. I can edit my goals on a daily basis when starting IF, OR set up a regular schedule. You can track water intake and weight loss and easily compare weight loss to fasting length on the same screen. Minimal, noninvasive ads and no required ‘plans’. I recommend this to everyone!”\nFeatures:\nSchedule out all your zero calorie fast and eating windows for the week and let the app timer run automatically with notifications telling you when to stop eating and when to start fasting.\nManual Mode: Choose a zero calorie fasting or eating window. Start and stop when you want. Edit all times, dates, goal length in real times.\nToday Widget\nEasily add, edit, delete, and .CSV export your completed fasts and body measurements like weight.\nVisualize and track your weight loss progress in the charts section.\nClock Format: Choose between 12 and 24 clock type and several different time display formats\nDate Format: Choose from several different local date formats to display throughout\nNotifications: Get notification reminders to fast every day, alerts for when your window is almost finished, and when it has completed.\nSimple, Clean, Minimalist, Clutter-Free Home Screen Timer\nUnlimited Fast Lengths\nMultiple Devices - Use your synced MyFast account on any device and never lose your data to an accident.\nExtra Tracking: Record water intake and other notes during your fast\nEnglish, Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese language options\nLearn Section – intermittent fasting book for beginners with all you need to know to become an IF expert\nWhat Is Intermittent Fasting?\nWhat usually comes to mind when most people hear of Intermittent Fasting (IF), is that it is just another crazy fad diet to lose weight with little effort. However, it isn't a diet at all, but rather an eating pattern. It’s not what you eat, but when you eat it that is important.\nDepending on what type of fasting you schedule, you generally will have a time window where you are allowed to eat all the food you want. As soon as that window is over though, you don't eat ANYTHING until the window comes up again. For example, a common approach is 16 hour fasts with an 8 hour eating window every day.\nThere are dozens of different type of fasting diets, and with MyFast you can utilize any plan such as:\n16/8 - Lean Gains\n5:2 - Eat normal for 5 days, and IF the remaining 2\n20/4 – The Warriot Diet\n24/0 – Full Day or Alternative Day Diet\nAlternative Day Diet - (every other day you will be fasting for 24 hours.)\nAny other zero calorie fasting plan you can think of is possible\nMyFast can be used free of charge, and within the app, you can choose to buy a subscription. With Subscription you can all premium features. Subscription renews automatically and charges to your iTunes Account. Subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of a period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of a period. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings after purchase.\nTerms of Services: https://myfasttracker.com/terms-and-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://myfasttracker.com/page-privacy"

Running deliveries is a great way to make an extra income, or it could be a better alternative to your current job. \n\nHOW IT WORKS \nHundreds, by the time you are reading this thousands of people will be ordering food through Food Run.

Such as a car, bike, scooter, or motorcycle (conditions apply). We will take care of the rest! \n\nHOW TO BECOME A RUNNER \nEmail us at info@foodrunja.com and place Runner in the subject line. Tell us where you are from, and provide details about your vehicle. Once vetted, it’ll take 1-2 weeks to get your account activated on our platform. And you will be running in no time. \n\n\nFood Run is currently available for businesses in Brown’s Town, Saint Ann but will be expanding to nearby towns and cities very soon. By the time you see this we might be operating in all 14 parishes. \n\nFind out if we’re in your area or learn more at: foodrunja.com"

However, it isn't a diet at all, but rather an eating pattern. It’s not what you eat, but when you eat it that is important.\nDepending on what type of fasting you schedule, you generally will have a time window where you are allowed to eat all the food you want. As soon as that window is over though, you don't eat ANYTHING until the window comes up again. For example, a common approach is 16 hour fasts with an 8 hour eating window every day.\nThere are dozens of different type of fasting diets, and with MyFast you can utilize any plan such as:\n16/8 - Lean Gains\n5:2 - Eat normal for 5 days, and IF the remaining 2\n20/4 – The Warriot Diet\n24/0 – Full Day or Alternative Day Diet\nAlternative Day Diet - (every other day you will be fasting for 24 hours.)\nAny other zero calorie fasting plan you can think of is possible\nMyFast can be used free of charge, and within the app, you can choose to buy a subscription. With Subscription you can all premium features. Subscription renews automatically and charges to your iTunes Account. Subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of a period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of a period. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings after purchase.\nTerms of Services: https://myfasttracker.com/terms-and-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://myfasttracker.com/page-privacy"

Discover new and exciting drinks, with 100’s of current recipes and new drinks added every week!\n\nWe have something for everyone - from current Pop Culture drinks, to new takes on favorites like the ‘TikTok Pink Drink’ to healthy choices like the ‘Healthy Passion’.\n\nUnique Features:\n\nPRO DRINKS:\nWe only use up to date recipes - no stale old content that has been sitting out there for years, with ingredients that don’t exist anymore. How do you know? Because we order each Secret Starbucks recipe and try it before taking our own photos and adding it to our App! Also, all of our drink recipes are reviewed and curated by real baristas who ensure that the recipes are going to taste great and are easy to order.\n\nDYNAMIC RECIPES: \nYou want your Secret Drink Tall, Grande or Venti? No problem! The recipe instantly adapts to the size you select directly at the recipe. That’s how we guarantee that you can always enjoy your secret drink, no matter which size you prefer.\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN FAVORITES LIST AND SAVE TIME:\nSimply add secret drinks to your personal \"favorite list\" to have all drinks you need in one place. With one tap you make sure that you will never forget your drinks or waste time searching for them again when ordering at Starbucks. Start today curating your own featured list like thousands already have.\n\nSPACE SAVING APP:\nTired of having no available space on your phone? Our App is smaller than the other Secret Menu Apps available. Of course we still give you access to hundreds of dynamic secret recipes that always include Photos and Ratings.\n\nPRO COMMUNITY:\nOur users are a key part of the experience - we know they are the true Starbucks fans. Whether submitting new recipes, connecting on our social media platforms, or creating new video content - we value your input. If there’s a way we can make the app better, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nEASY IN-APP Experience:\nUnlike some other apps out there, our app is built to provide an amazing user experience, with well designed navigation, categorization and search, a sleek modern interface, and quality original photography. The Best Secret Menu for Starbucks!\n\nPRO DEVELOPERS:\nWe’re a small indie app development company that strives to make beautiful apps that are a pleasure to use. Design Matters. Less is More. Enjoy.\n\nLEGAL:\nBuilt by fans, for fans - this mobile app provides an easy and convenient interface to view user submitted drink ideas from the global Starbucks community. While we extensively curate the content and do our best to maintain the accuracy of the recipes, some ingredients may no longer be available and therefore some recipes may not be available. PRO subscription does not guarantee 100% accuracy and availability of all recipes.\n\nWe do not represent or are associated in any way with the Starbucks Corporation. Starbucks Coffee Company, Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, and other Starbucks trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the app are trade names, trademarks or registered trademarks of Starbucks Corporation.\n\nPlease find our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use here: https://www.anthemventuresus.com/privacy-policy"

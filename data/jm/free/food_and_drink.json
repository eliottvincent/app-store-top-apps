It’s simple yet complex in a good way. Great app. Recommended!\"\n\"MyFast is the best intermittent fasting tracker and weekly scheduler app available. It quickly guides you through the overall concept of fasting and will help you completely manage your fasting and eating windows. With over 200,000+ fast trackers, we are the most complete and trusted IF timer.\"\n\"Favorite app for tracking fasting / weight loss. I’m terrible at counting time and that’s the whole reason I have this app. I can set my goal by deciding I want to do an 18 hr fast and it tells me when to stop fasting. I can edit my goals on a daily basis when starting IF, OR set up a regular schedule. You can track water intake and weight loss and easily compare weight loss to fasting length on the same screen. Minimal, noninvasive ads and no required ‘plans’. I recommend this to everyone!”\nFeatures:\nSchedule out all your zero calorie fast and eating windows for the week and let the app timer run automatically with notifications telling you when to stop eating and when to start fasting.\nManual Mode: Choose a zero calorie fasting or eating window. Start and stop when you want. Edit all times, dates, goal length in real times.\nToday Widget\nEasily add, edit, delete, and .CSV export your completed fasts and body measurements like weight.\nVisualize and track your weight loss progress in the charts section.\nClock Format: Choose between 12 and 24 clock type and several different time display formats\nDate Format: Choose from several different local date formats to display throughout\nNotifications: Get notification reminders to fast every day, alerts for when your window is almost finished, and when it has completed.\nSimple, Clean, Minimalist, Clutter-Free Home Screen Timer\nUnlimited Fast Lengths\nMultiple Devices - Use your synced MyFast account on any device and never lose your data to an accident.\nExtra Tracking: Record water intake and other notes during your fast\nEnglish, Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese language options\nLearn Section – intermittent fasting book for beginners with all you need to know to become an IF expert\nWhat Is Intermittent Fasting?\nWhat usually comes to mind when most people hear of Intermittent Fasting (IF), is that it is just another crazy fad diet to lose weight with little effort. However, it isn't a diet at all, but rather an eating pattern. It’s not what you eat, but when you eat it that is important.\nDepending on what type of fasting you schedule, you generally will have a time window where you are allowed to eat all the food you want. As soon as that window is over though, you don't eat ANYTHING until the window comes up again. For example, a common approach is 16 hour fasts with an 8 hour eating window every day.\nThere are dozens of different type of fasting diets, and with MyFast you can utilize any plan such as:\n16/8 - Lean Gains\n5:2 - Eat normal for 5 days, and IF the remaining 2\n20/4 – The Warriot Diet\n24/0 – Full Day or Alternative Day Diet\nAlternative Day Diet - (every other day you will be fasting for 24 hours.)\nAny other zero calorie fasting plan you can think of is possible\nMyFast can be used free of charge, and within the app, you can choose to buy a subscription. With Subscription you can all premium features. Subscription renews automatically and charges to your iTunes Account. Subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of a period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of a period. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings after purchase.\nTerms of Services: https://myfasttracker.com/terms-and-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://myfasttracker.com/page-privacy"

Learn to cook with us through step-by-step explanations of foundational cooking concepts in fewer than 10 minutes and dishes that bring the concept to life. Our recipes are created by two former Michelin star chefs, distilled by a home chef, and cooked by you, the superstar home cook that you are (or will be). We don't assume any prior culinary knowledge. We meet you where you are and help you improve.\n \nStop copying traditional recipes - start learning from Zest. We've cooked those delicious Bon Appetit dinners. But when we took away the recipes we felt like lost puppies. Zest is designed to teach you the how's and why's of cooking.

Skill videos are linked in each recipe to guide you along, so you don't have to watch Gordon Ramsey on YouTube (we love his accent too).\n\nCURATED MENU\nChoose a menu to fit your preferences.

      "label": "As featured on Paramount Network's \"Bar Rescue\" Partender is a patented, subscription-based business tool with a proprietary design that empowers you to:\n• Easily complete full bar inventory in 15 minutes\n• With up to 99.2% accuracy\n• Split up the work across as many users as you'd like on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and even the web\n• Generate editable \"Smart Orders\" based on what you actually went through\n• Place, track, and receive those orders online\n• Get alerted when prices change\n• Get your Usage (for Variance)\n• Get your Actual Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for Bev Cost %\n• See what’s trending in your venue (incl. Top Movers & Dead Stock)\n• Integrate with ERPs\n\nAnd besides saving time and labor, our customers:\n1) Reduce Inventory Value On-Hand by 20-40%\n2) Reduce Beverage Cost by 6-8%\n3) Reduce Cost of Goods Fluctuation by 10%\n\n...all in just 90 days of weekly use after setup.\n\n\nWHAT REAL CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING:\n\"Inventory takes less than 15 minutes now. It used to take 2 hours with 3 people counting, for a total of 6 labor hours.\" \n- Grant S. at Boston Pizza\n\t\n“It takes us just 15 minutes to do inventory, which we do at least twice a week. We stopped running out of things, and thanks to Partender, we managed to get beverage costs down to below 20% in a couple months.\"\n- Mike W. at Marriott\n\n\nHOW? WHY?\nBecause the same reason why you count the cash in the register at the end of every night (or every shift) is the exact same reason why you count the liquid cash sitting on your shelves. If you don't, it'll disappear!\n\nAnd when your inventory is 10-50x more valuable than your cash register, it makes sense to count it as carefully as the till, but that's been impossible until Partender.\n\nSo throw out your paper-and-pen and homegrown spreadsheets. Do inventory in minutes - not hours. See what's selling the best/worst, what's dead stock (and needs to be phased out via happy hour promotions), and what's about to run out and get 86'd (so you never miss a sale). \n\nStop manually typing your inventory into Excel or a glorified web-based spreadsheet. Let Partender streamline all of your inventory, ordering, and accounting operations in just 15 minutes a week.\n\n\nWITH PARTENDER, YOU CAN:\n• Monitor actual depletions\n• See real-time customer insights for your actual guests on a per-product or per-category basis\n• Instantly receive your Value On-Hand (\"Balance Sheet\") in wholesale and retail dollars after every inventory\n• Optimize your par levels (based on online graphs) to buy more of what's selling the best and less of what's selling the worst\n• Clearly understand why your cost of goods is going up (due to Price Change Alerts or due to shrinkage* via our Usage / Variance Report online)\n\n*Shrinkage is the loss of inventory due to over-pouring, theft, breakage, spillage, inaccurate counting, not receiving product, etc. And there's an average 23% shrinkage in our industry, which causes 60-80% of bars and restaurants to fail within their first 3 years... or lose tons in revenue.\n\n\nHOW DOES PARTENDER WORK?\n1) Build a virtual \"blueprint\" of your venue after organizing your bar\n2) Split up the work of inventory across Main Bar, Back Bar, Stock Room, etc. \n3) Instead of manually writing down your inventory using an arbitrary 10-point scale, cumbersome scales, or expensive hardware, simply tap where the liquor level is on the real image of the bottle and swipe to the next bottle on your shelf.\n4) That's it! Our proprietary algorithms are up to 99.2% accurate so you know down to the drop & dollar-value how much each bottle is worth in Retail & Wholesale Dollars ($).\n\n\nINVENTORY ANYTHING:\nIn addition to liquor, you can inventory beer, wine, smallwares, kegs, and food! Our database is huge. If there's something on your shelf that's not in our database: take a picture of it, and our proprietary algorithms will do the rest.\n\n\nANALYTICS IN THE CLOUD:\nJust log into your web dashboard to see COGS, beautiful consumption graphs, and actionable usage reports."

      "label": "Found a recipe on the internet that looks great? Yum! Add it to Whisk and start creating your personal cookbook. Pull recipes from any website or cooking site/app, substitute ingredients, adjust serving sizes or, if you want to, just change the way the recipes are written. No need to continue memorizing the recipe edits or writing them down on paper.\r\n\r\nGet inspired! Check out our community of home cooks for new gourmet dishes, quick meals, recipes with 10 ingredients or less, everyday healthy ideas, you name it. Add all your go-to recipes to Whisk and create your own personal recipe book!\r\n\r\nWant to plan your weekly meals ahead? Unlike other meal planning apps, Whisk Meal Planner is entirely free.\r\n\r\n...And best of all: with the push of a button turn all recipes into a shareable shopping list to use to buy food in-store & online. No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com.

Of course we still give you access to hundreds of dynamic secret recipes that always include Photos and Ratings.\n\nPRO COMMUNITY:\nOur users are a key part of the experience - we know they are the true Starbucks fans. Whether submitting new recipes, connecting on our social media platforms, or creating new video content - we value your input. If there’s a way we can make the app better, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nEASY IN-APP Experience:\nUnlike some other apps out there, our app is built to provide an amazing user experience, with well designed navigation, categorization and search, a sleek modern interface, and quality original photography. The Best Secret Menu for Starbucks!\n\nPRO DEVELOPERS:\nWe’re a small indie app development company that strives to make beautiful apps that are a pleasure to use. Design Matters. Less is More. Enjoy.\n\nLEGAL:\nBuilt by fans, for fans - this mobile app provides an easy and convenient interface to view user submitted drink ideas from the global Starbucks community. While we extensively curate the content and do our best to maintain the accuracy of the recipes, some ingredients may no longer be available and therefore some recipes may not be available. PRO subscription does not guarantee 100% accuracy and availability of all recipes.\n\nWe do not represent or are associated in any way with the Starbucks Corporation. Starbucks Coffee Company, Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, and other Starbucks trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with the app are trade names, trademarks or registered trademarks of Starbucks Corporation.\n\nPlease find our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use here: https://www.anthemventuresus.com/privacy-policy"

If you've never tried meal planning before, this Bodybuilding MealPrep Recipes app has everything you need to know to get started!\n\nBodybuilding is centered around building your body’s muscles through weightlifting and nutrition.\nWhether recreational or competitive, bodybuilding is often referred to as a lifestyle, as it involves both the time you spend in and outside the gym.\nIn order to maximize your results from the gym, you must focus on your diet, as eating the wrong foods can be detrimental to your bodybuilding goals.\nWith careful planning, bodybuilders can eat in a way that not only supports their efforts in the gym but keeps them healthy too.\n\nWhether you're looking for a simple meal plan to lose weight fast or the best bulking foods for a muscle-building meal plan, some things remain consistent: Your workouts will probably feel better with easy-digesting starchy carbs and fewer fats before and after workouts to promote energy and muscle growth. But no matter how you approach details like this, the most important answers to \"what should I eat?\" and \"how much should I eat?\" are right here in these healthy recipes!\n\nThe goal for competitive bodybuilders is to increase muscle mass in the bulking phase and reduce body fat in the cutting phase. Hence, you consume more calories in the bulking phase than in the cutting phase.\n\nLike training, diet is a vital part of bodybuilding.\nEating the right foods in the appropriate amounts provides your muscles with the nutrients they need to recover from workouts and grow bigger and stronger.\nNo matter if your goal is to bulk up, lose weight, or just stay healthy, how you train is only one part of the plan. \n\nTo produce the best results for your body, pair your training regimen with meal plans that power your toughest workouts and get you closer to your personal goals. \n\n- Quick and Simple Cooking recipes\n- Improve the Effectiveness of Training\n- Become Active and Healthy\n- Easy-to-follow recipes\n\nThese app include:\n- 40 delicious recipes for every mealtime with key macronutrients and nutrition panels provided for every recipe\n- 10 main meals (all ridiculously tasty)\n- 10 breakfasts (with plenty of variety)\n- 10 ‘power shake’ recipes (jam-packed with vitamins and minerals)\n- 10 healthy snacks (sooo good you wouldn’t believe they’re healthy)\n\nThese recipes are ideal for people who exercise regularly and are looking for nutritious food to not only fuel their workouts, but help their body repair and recover afterwards.\nSo let's get cooking…download the app now!\n\n- Subscription length: 1 month\n- Free trial: 3 days\n- Price for the subscription after free trial: $1.99\n- Subscription type: auto-renewable\n- Subscription length: 6 months\n- Price for the subscription: $9.99\n- Subscription length: 12 months\n- Price for the subscription: $17.99\n- Payment will be charge to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period\n\n- Privacy: http://lupu.digitallabs.ro/StretchingPrograms/Privacy/\n- Terms: http://lupu.digitallabs.ro/StretchingPrograms/Terms/\n- Contact: http://lupu.digitallabs.ro/StretchingPrograms/Contact/"

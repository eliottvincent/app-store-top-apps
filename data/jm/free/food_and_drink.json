Цены и выбор — как в магазине у дома.\n\nАКЦИИ\nМы проводим акции и каждый день обновляем скидки на продукты и напитки. Например, промокод SM100 даёт скидку 100 ₽ на три первых заказа. Акция действует, если оформить доставку продуктов на дом от 800 ₽. А если вы любите бонусы — войдите по Сбер ID. Так вы сможете копить СберСпасибо и тратить их на заказы в Самокате.\n\nГОРОДА\nМосква, Санкт-Петербург, Альметьевск, Астрахань, Барнаул, Белгород, Брянск, Великий Новгород, Владимир, Волгоград, Вологда, Воронеж, Екатеринбург, Иваново, Ижевск, Казань, Калуга, Кемерово, Киров, Коломна, Краснодар, Красноярск, Курск, Липецк, Магнитогорск, Набережные Челны, Нижнекамск, Нижний Новгород, Нижний Тагил, Новокузнецк, Новосибирск, Новочебоксарск, Ногинск, Омск, Оренбург, Орехово-Зуево, Орёл, Пенза, Пермь, Ростов-на-Дону, Рязань, Самара, Саранск, Саратов, Смоленск, Сочи, Ставрополь, Стерлитамак, Таганрог, Тамбов, Тверь, Тольятти, Томск, Тула, Тюмень, Ульяновск, Уфа, Чебоксары, Челябинск, Череповец, Энгельс и Ярославль.\n\nБЫСТРО\nДоставим продукты на дом за 15–30 минут. Так быстро, потому что в каждом районе свой даркстор. Даркстор похож на продуктовый магазин: внутри полки с продуктами и холодильники, а вместо покупателей — сборщики. Заказ собирают за 2–3 минуты, а затем передают курьерам. Они развозят их по району на велосипедах.\n\nКАК В МАГАЗИНЕ У ДОМА\nУ нас есть:\n+ готовая еда\n+ овощи и фрукты\n+ продукты и подарки на Новый год\n+ новогодние украшения\n+ крупы, макароны и консервы\n+ мясо и птица\n+ замороженная еда\n+ молоко, яйца и масло\n+ хлеб и выпечка\n+ сыры\n+ колбаса и сосиски\n+ рыба и морепродукты\n+ чай и кофе\n+ вода, лимонады и соки\n+ сладкое\n+ мороженое\n+ чипсы\n+ безалкогольное пиво и вино\n+ веганские продукты и напитки\n+ товары и продукты из других стран\n+ товары для детей\n+ товары для животных\n+ шампуни и гели для душа\n+ товары для дома\n+ косметика и средства для ухода\n\nВСЁ СВЕЖЕЕ\nДва раза в день наши сотрудники проверяют срок годности товаров и внешний вид фруктов и овощей. В холодильниках в дарксторе мы поддерживаем температуру 2–4 °С, в морозильных камерах −18 °С.\n\nОТ САМОКАТА\nУ нас есть своя марка, под ней мы выпускаем продукты и товары для дома. Сами ищем производителей — больших и маленьких. Общаемся с ними и выбираем тех, кто по-настоящему любит и знает своё дело. Весь список продуктов проверяем на безопасность в лабораториях и пробуем сами.\n\nСУПЕРМАРКЕТ\nУ нас есть Супермаркет. Это большой магазин, в котором в два раза больше всего. Например, там есть бытовая техника, экзотические фрукты и большие пачки корма для питомцев. Удобно, чтобы закупиться сразу на неделю. Время доставки — от 15 минут до 1,5 часа.\n\nБЬЮТИ\nВ Москве работает Бьюти. Загляните, там много интересного: от корейских масок до салонной косметики для волос. Бренды — как масс-маркет, так и нишевые, много органических марок. Доставка в день заказа.\n\nМЕДИА\nВ приложении выходит много контента: рецепты, советы экспертов, обзоры продуктов и косметики, гиды по ингредиентам. Наша цель — развлекать, вдохновлять и быть полезными.\n\nГДЕ НАС ИСКАТЬ\nВКонтакте — vk.com/samokat_15min\nТелеграм — t.me/samokatwithlove\nТелеграм Бьюти — t.me/samokat_beauty"

      "label": "How many times have you found yourself looking for that perfect recipe – only to find that you’re missing one or more ingredients?\n\nHow many times have you opened the fridge and thought to yourself -- what can I make ?\n\nHow many times have you thrown away an ingredient, because you couldn't figure out how to use it before it expired ?\n\nSuperCook to the rescue!\n\nUnlike other recipe apps,  SuperCook only shows you recipes that require the ingredients you already have.  \n\nAll the recipes you see on SuperCook  are recipes you can make right now.  No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends\n\nWhy purchase new ingredients when you can focus on what you already have?\n\nHere’s how it works:\n• For Supercook to do its magic, it needs to know all the ingredients you have at home.\n• Visit the pantry page in the SuperCook app and choose from a list of 2000+ ingredients broken down into categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, and many more. \n• Start adding ALL the ingredients you have at home to your SuperCook pantry – including oils, spices, and yes - even that old bottle of Worcestershire sauce in the back of the fridge!\n• Sit back and watch SuperCook work its magic by finding recipes that match your ingredients.\n\nSuperCook’s Unique App Features:\n \n--Customized Recipe Ideas--\nWe’ve consolidated over 11 million recipes from 18,000 recipe websites, in 20 languages to create the largest recipe collection ever.   This knowledge was fed into an AI system that learnt the intricacies of all ingredients and how they can be mixed together.\n\nAll you have to do is build your pantry on the app – and you’re ready to make delicious meals without ever leaving your house!\n\nSuperCook will find you any recipe you need, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a midnight snack.  \n\n--Easily Add Your Ingredients--\nSave time and money with an intelligent pantry. SuperCook’s voice dictation mode allows you to quickly add ingredients to your in-app pantry by simply saying them out loud.\n\nJust open your fridge, click the microphone button, and start listing everything inside. The app will automatically add the ingredients to your pantry for a quick and easy way to find recipes!\n \n--Automatic Recipe Recommendations--\nThe app will automatically find you recipes to make with what’s in your fridge – so all those lost ingredients in the back of your cupboard now have a place on your table.  It’s that simple!\n\nWhen you run out of an ingredient, simply open the SuperCook app and remove it from your pantry -  and all the recipe ideas will adjust accordingly.\n \n--Get Creative in the Kitchen--\nSuperCook inspires new ideas and activities in the kitchen for new cooks, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike.\n\nWith over 11 million recipes available in 20 different languages, SuperCook promises that you’ll never cook the same thing twice (unless you want to, of course!).\n\n--What's on the menu ?--\nThe menu page is where you'll find all your recipe ideas.  Why is it called menu?  Because just like the menu in a restaurant, everything on the menu page is available to you now.  SuperCook instantly analyzes 11 million recipes and finds the ones that match your unique ingredients.\n\nMost likely your menu page will contain thousands of recipes, but don't worry, we've broken them down into helpful categories like soups and stews, appetizers and snacks, salads, entrees, desserts and more.\n\n--Reduce food waste--\nMost people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. SuperCook is one of the best ways to reduce food waste in the home.   It finds recipes that use as many of your ingredients as possible, so nothing goes to waste.    SuperCook makes food waste prevention fun and easy, just open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe.   We help you use what you have, so nothing goes to waste!"

Discover new and exciting drinks, with 100’s of current recipes and new drinks added every week!\n\nWe have something for everyone - from current Pop Culture drinks, to new takes on favorites like the ‘TikTok Pink Drink’ to healthy choices like the ‘Healthy Passion’.\n\nUnique Features:\n\nPRO DRINKS:\nWe only use up to date recipes - no stale old content that has been sitting out there for years, with ingredients that don’t exist anymore. How do you know? Because we order each Secret Starbucks recipe and try it before taking our own photos and adding it to our App! Also, all of our drink recipes are reviewed and curated by real baristas who ensure that the recipes are going to taste great and are easy to order.\n\nDYNAMIC RECIPES: \nYou want your Secret Drink Tall, Grande or Venti? No problem! The recipe instantly adapts to the size you select directly at the recipe. That’s how we guarantee that you can always enjoy your secret drink, no matter which size you prefer.\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN FAVORITES LIST AND SAVE TIME:\nSimply add secret drinks to your personal \"favorite list\" to have all drinks you need in one place. With one tap you make sure that you will never forget your drinks or waste time searching for them again when ordering at Starbucks. Start today curating your own featured list like thousands already have.\n\nSPACE SAVING APP:\nTired of having no available space on your phone? Our App is smaller than the other Secret Menu Apps available. Of course we still give you access to hundreds of dynamic secret recipes that always include Photos and Ratings.\n\nPRO COMMUNITY:\nOur users are a key part of the experience - we know they are the true Starbucks fans. Whether submitting new recipes, connecting on our social media platforms, or creating new video content - we value your input. If there’s a way we can make the app better, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nEASY IN-APP Experience:\nUnlike some other apps out there, our app is built to provide an amazing user experience, with well designed navigation, categorization and search, a sleek modern interface, and quality original photography. The Best Secret Menu for Starbucks!\n\nPRO DEVELOPERS:\nWe’re a small indie app development company that strives to make beautiful apps that are a pleasure to use. Design Matters. Less is More. Enjoy.\n\nLEGAL:\nBuilt by fans, for fans - this mobile app provides an easy and convenient interface to view user submitted drink ideas from the global Starbucks community. While we extensively curate the content and do our best to maintain the accuracy of the recipes, some ingredients may no longer be available and therefore some recipes may not be available. PRO subscription does not guarantee 100% accuracy and availability of all recipes.\n\nWe do not represent or are associated in any way with the Starbucks Corporation.

It’s simple yet complex in a good way. Great app. Recommended!\"\n\"MyFast is the best intermittent fasting tracker and weekly scheduler app available. It quickly guides you through the overall concept of fasting and will help you completely manage your fasting and eating windows. With over 200,000+ fast trackers, we are the most complete and trusted IF timer.\"\n\"Favorite app for tracking fasting / weight loss. I’m terrible at counting time and that’s the whole reason I have this app. I can set my goal by deciding I want to do an 18 hr fast and it tells me when to stop fasting. I can edit my goals on a daily basis when starting IF, OR set up a regular schedule. You can track water intake and weight loss and easily compare weight loss to fasting length on the same screen. Minimal, noninvasive ads and no required ‘plans’. I recommend this to everyone!”\nFeatures:\nSchedule out all your zero calorie fast and eating windows for the week and let the app timer run automatically with notifications telling you when to stop eating and when to start fasting.\nManual Mode: Choose a zero calorie fasting or eating window. Start and stop when you want.

However, it isn't a diet at all, but rather an eating pattern. It’s not what you eat, but when you eat it that is important.\nDepending on what type of fasting you schedule, you generally will have a time window where you are allowed to eat all the food you want. As soon as that window is over though, you don't eat ANYTHING until the window comes up again. For example, a common approach is 16 hour fasts with an 8 hour eating window every day.\nThere are dozens of different type of fasting diets, and with MyFast you can utilize any plan such as:\n16/8 - Lean Gains\n5:2 - Eat normal for 5 days, and IF the remaining 2\n20/4 – The Warriot Diet\n24/0 – Full Day or Alternative Day Diet\nAlternative Day Diet - (every other day you will be fasting for 24 hours.)\nAny other zero calorie fasting plan you can think of is possible\nMyFast can be used free of charge, and within the app, you can choose to buy a subscription. With Subscription you can all premium features. Subscription renews automatically and charges to your iTunes Account. Subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of a period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of a period. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings after purchase.\nTerms of Services: https://myfasttracker.com/terms-and-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://myfasttracker.com/page-privacy"

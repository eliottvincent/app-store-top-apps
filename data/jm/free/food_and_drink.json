It’s simple yet complex in a good way. Great app. Recommended!\"\n\"MyFast is the best intermittent fasting tracker and weekly scheduler app available.

However, it isn't a diet at all, but rather an eating pattern. It’s not what you eat, but when you eat it that is important.\nDepending on what type of fasting you schedule, you generally will have a time window where you are allowed to eat all the food you want. As soon as that window is over though, you don't eat ANYTHING until the window comes up again. For example, a common approach is 16 hour fasts with an 8 hour eating window every day.\nThere are dozens of different type of fasting diets, and with MyFast you can utilize any plan such as:\n16/8 - Lean Gains\n5:2 - Eat normal for 5 days, and IF the remaining 2\n20/4 – The Warriot Diet\n24/0 – Full Day or Alternative Day Diet\nAlternative Day Diet - (every other day you will be fasting for 24 hours.)\nAny other zero calorie fasting plan you can think of is possible\nMyFast can be used free of charge, and within the app, you can choose to buy a subscription. With Subscription you can all premium features. Subscription renews automatically and charges to your iTunes Account. Subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of a period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of a period. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings after purchase.\nTerms of Services: https://myfasttracker.com/terms-and-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://myfasttracker.com/page-privacy"

No more inconvenient grocery runs for a missing ingredient, at a time when you should be home, with your family and friends\n\nWhy purchase new ingredients when you can focus on what you already have?\n\nHere’s how it works:\n• For Supercook to do its magic, it needs to know all the ingredients you have at home.\n• Visit the pantry page in the SuperCook app and choose from a list of 2000+ ingredients broken down into categories like fruits, vegetables, meats, and many more. \n• Start adding ALL the ingredients you have at home to your SuperCook pantry – including oils, spices, and yes - even that old bottle of Worcestershire sauce in the back of the fridge!\n• Sit back and watch SuperCook work its magic by finding recipes that match your ingredients.\n\nSuperCook’s Unique App Features:\n \n--Customized Recipe Ideas--\nWe’ve consolidated over 11 million recipes from 18,000 recipe websites, in 20 languages to create the largest recipe collection ever.   This knowledge was fed into an AI system that learnt the intricacies of all ingredients and how they can be mixed together.\n\nAll you have to do is build your pantry on the app – and you’re ready to make delicious meals without ever leaving your house!\n\nSuperCook will find you any recipe you need, whether it’s for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a midnight snack.  \n\n--Easily Add Your Ingredients--\nSave time and money with an intelligent pantry. SuperCook’s voice dictation mode allows you to quickly add ingredients to your in-app pantry by simply saying them out loud.\n\nJust open your fridge, click the microphone button, and start listing everything inside. The app will automatically add the ingredients to your pantry for a quick and easy way to find recipes!\n \n--Automatic Recipe Recommendations--\nThe app will automatically find you recipes to make with what’s in your fridge – so all those lost ingredients in the back of your cupboard now have a place on your table.  It’s that simple!\n\nWhen you run out of an ingredient, simply open the SuperCook app and remove it from your pantry -  and all the recipe ideas will adjust accordingly.\n \n--Get Creative in the Kitchen--\nSuperCook inspires new ideas and activities in the kitchen for new cooks, busy parents, foodies, and pro chefs alike.\n\nWith over 11 million recipes available in 20 different languages, SuperCook promises that you’ll never cook the same thing twice (unless you want to, of course!).\n\n--What's on the menu ?--\nThe menu page is where you'll find all your recipe ideas.  Why is it called menu?  Because just like the menu in a restaurant, everything on the menu page is available to you now.  SuperCook instantly analyzes 11 million recipes and finds the ones that match your unique ingredients.\n\nMost likely your menu page will contain thousands of recipes, but don't worry, we've broken them down into helpful categories like soups and stews, appetizers and snacks, salads, entrees, desserts and more.\n\n--Reduce food waste--\nMost people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce. SuperCook is one of the best ways to reduce food waste in the home.   It finds recipes that use as many of your ingredients as possible, so nothing goes to waste.    SuperCook makes food waste prevention fun and easy, just open the menu page on the app and choose a recipe.   We help you use what you have, so nothing goes to waste!"

Classifying the wine color as red, white and rosé is not sufficient for wine lovers like us. A wine's color is more complex and informative than these 3 color categories. For example;\n\nWines with brighter red color tend to have higher acidity, while wines with a blueish hue usually have lower acidity. When wines age, white wines darken and red wines lose color and tend to have orange and brown hues. Light-bodied wines tend to have a lighter and more translucent color where full-bodied wines have deeper colors. Using all that information and more, our app analyzes your wine color and give your wine's characteristics. \n\nWe love to talk about wine, so download our app, learn your wine's tasting characteristics and share it with your friends!"

No more “oops! I forgot” moments when cooking! Use Whisk to make cooking more efficient and fun!\r\n\r\nHere's What the Media is Saying About Us\r\n“(. . .) all designed to make it easier to meal plan, make and share lists and, finally, shop” - TechCrunch, Sarah Perez\r\n\r\n“Smart food platform Whisk helps you meal prep like a true pro (. . .).” – Women’s Health, Amanda Woerner\r\n\r\n“Not only does this technology allow for a much better experience, but should help reduce food waste” - Forbes, Tom Taulli\r\n\r\nBENEFITS\r\n- Copy recipes from anywhere: Yes, really, any website. Try it out. No need to take screenshots or copy and paste recipes into a notebook anymore. Transfer recipes directly from Food Network, BBC Good Food, food blogs, Pinterest and from all over the internet. Use the web recipe clipper on your PC or easily save recipes from any mobile site. Never forget where you saved that recipe again!\r\n\r\n- Edit recipes that you’ve imported: Add notes and comments about the things that you want to change and remember for next time. Maybe you want to sub in some healthy ingredients on that lasagna that you are cooking, or you want to add one more tablespoon of coconut oil to your new keto recipe….go ahead, replace ingredients and enhance your recipe cookbook.\r\n\r\n- Create your ideal meal plan for the week: an easy pork recipe for lunch on Monday, a healthy salad on Tuesday and a gourmet Italian dish for dinner on Friday.  Simplify your meal planning for the week, save time and avoid leftovers.\r\n\r\n- Remember what inspired you: Can't figure out where you saw that simple and tasty dish from Indian cuisine?  Quickly access your saved recipe collections: vegan dishes, gluten-free baking, paleo diets, low-carb meals - anything you like!\r\n\r\n-  Turn your recipes into shopping lists: Push a button and have your grocery list ready in case you make an unexpected stop at the store. Organize your list by aisle for speedy market visits and save time.\r\n\r\n- Get the groceries delivered to you: Whisk partners with popular online grocers like Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Ralphs, Instacart and many more. Enter your zip code, select your preferred store, checkout and get your groceries delivered at your door.\r\n\r\n- Collaborate on and share your lists: Create a shared shopping list with everybody in your house to prevent buying duplicate groceries and to make sure that nothing is forgotten. Take the list to the store and save time as each family member takes a different aisle and - as items are picked - watch your grocery shopping list mark off in front of everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd MORE!\r\n- Share recipes: Just made the perfect smoked paprika chicken? Share it with your friends and family.\r\n- Make it yours: customize your dietary preferences: vegetarian, vegan, lacto vegetarian, pescatarian.\r\n- Smarter food decisions: All recipes which have been imported to Whisk include ingredient details, cooking instructions, and Whisk’s health score, with nutritional information.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email us at support@whisk.com. We want to make sure your Whisk experience is the best it can be!"

      "label": "CAUTION: CONTAINS WEIRD & WILD FLAVORS\n\nThere is a new way to take the BeanBoozled Challenge. This app lets users play the game (remotely and in person), capture photos, find retailers and order online. \n\nBeanBoozled is a game of risk with two different challenging ways to play. Are you brave enough? \n\nThe original BeanBoozled:  Ten delicious Jelly Belly jelly bean flavors (like Juicy Pear or Pomegranate) have been paired up with ten lookalikes in weird and wild flavors (like Booger or Old Bandage). Will it be Buttered Popcorn or Rotten Egg? Peach or Barf? There’s only one way to find out! \n\nThe BeanBoozled Fiery Five Challenge asks how hot can you handle? Five progressively hot jelly beans range from smoldering Sriracha to scorching Carolina Reaper. Can you handle the heat?\n\nWhat is the BeanBoozled App?\n• Take the game anywhere! Take turns spinning the BeanBoozled wheel in the app to see what flavor you’ll have to try next.\n• The app comes with a video sharing function so you can challenge your friends – wherever they are – in real time. You don’t need to physically be together to play BeanBoozled! Just use the built-in “Challenge A Friend” feature to play with your friend remotely. The app will send an invitation to your friend to play, and once they accept, you’re sharing the same spinner and playing the game together.\n• Take photos while you play in the “Challenge A Friend” mode, or 6-second GIFs of the crazy faces your friends make. Add photo frames and share them to your social media channels.\n• When you run out of a flavor, simply tell the app and the spinner will continue play without landing on what you’re missing.\n• Need more BeanBoozled jelly beans? Search for a store near you with our built-in Store Locator, or use the option to buy online.\n• Not sure what the jelly bean flavors are? Consult the handy flavor menu in the app for a helpful guide.\n\nA Few Tips…\n• DO have a trash can handy at all times. Trust us – you’ll need it.\n• If you're playing BeanBoozled Fiery Five, have some milk, ice cream, rice or honey handy to extinguish the burn.\n• DO NOT let wimps or crybabies play this game. (OK- maybe let them play after all. It can be fun to watch!)\n• DO Make up your own rules. This is BeanBoozled where anything goes! Your imagination is your only limit.\n\nPlaying with your food has never been this much fun!"

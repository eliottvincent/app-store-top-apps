      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

Now imagine turning those visions into design materials to immediately use in apps like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Adobe Fresco. The power to transform the world around you into creative assets to build your projects is in the palm of your hands. The creation of graphic design elements is now just a camera click away.\n\nRemove Background from Images\nTake your photo inspiration and transform the background to use in your design projects. Create high-quality graphics to use in your projects.\n\nVectorize on the Go\nCreate vectors instantly with Shapes. Turn images into smooth, detailed, scalable vectors with 1-32 colors, for use in logos, illustration, animation, and more.  Point and shoot at your drawing or upload a photo and watch it magically transform into clean, crisp lines.\n\nVoice or Audio to text\nRecord your voice to see it transform in text. Replace and add text in your speech directly by editing the transcript. This new audio recording feature is easy to use and will enhance your audio creations. Import audio files to different Adobe apps or download them to your device as WAV files.\n\nIdentify Typography\nFind your perfect font using Adobe Capture. Take a photo of the type you like (in a magazine, on a label, a sign, anywhere!) and watch a list of similar Adobe Fonts magically appear.\n\nCreate Color Themes and Gradients\nLooking for customized color palettes?

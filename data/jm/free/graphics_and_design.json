Vega even allows you to create transparent widgets to create the ultimate home screen experience!\n\nYou would like the widget to show the temperature in your area instead of the space available in your device? No problem! You can literally make it yours to fit your needs.\n\nAvailable features of our editor, among many more, include:\n\n- Weather Info. Would you like to see if tomorrow is going to be sunny? You can do it with Vega!\n- Image Layers. Would you like to see a specific photo of your album right in your home screen? You can absolutely do it. But you can also search images from a huge library of professional photos to find that specific one that you're looking for.\n- Time Info. Create your own clock!\n- Activity Info. How many steps you've done today? Or, have you exercised? \n- Tap Actions. With Tap Actions, you could for example choose to open an app when tapping on a specific area of the widget! You can create shortcuts to open your most used apps if you like!\n\n \nTo have access to Vega Premium content and functionalities, you can choose between a monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription. This is a recurring transaction that will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase and will automatically renew unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the end of your subscription. Renewals will be charged the same cost within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage your subscriptions and auto-renewal can be turned off by going to your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n\n\nTerms of Service: https://idecapps.com/privacy/\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://idecapps.com/terms/\n\n\nNOTE: Vega optionally makes use of Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data such as Activity if you want to show it in one of your widgets. Permission for Vega to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app."

Show your creativity and impress everyone.\r\n\r\nWhat users are saying:\r\n\r\n- User2300, 11/05/2020 5*\r\nBEST APP FOR WIDGETS\r\nOut of the what seems like millions of apps I’ve downloaded in efforts to make an “aesthetic” Home Screen they have all had some glitch in them that makes it nearly impossible to even load one widget onto the screen, and when you finally do it’s not even the right picture, but this app is PHENOMENAL it’s so simple and self explanatory to use.\r\n\r\n- Puvs1, 12/08/2020 5*\r\nLOVE IT\r\nAmazing app with so many different options\r\n\r\n- charli damelio eats my feet, 11/10/2020 5*\r\nit’s AMAZING\r\nit doesn’t cost money and you can just watch the ads instead to pay. It’s so much easier to edit your home screen with so many ideas. I wish they could add widgets that come with it. I told all my friends to get it it’s soooo good. Overall it’s the best app i’ve found so far to make your home screen aesthetic.\n\n\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nPREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION (weekly or annual subscription):\n- Get access to all the features\n- Get premium content updates\n- No ads\n\n\n\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- The account​ will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\nYou can read our Privacy policy and Terms of Use at https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/50448913 https://www.iubenda.com/terms-and-conditions/50448913"

      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

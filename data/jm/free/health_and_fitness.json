      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "- WHAT IS LOÓNA?\nloóna is the first app that lets you quickly disconnect from a long stressful day and get in the right mood for sleep.\n\n- SO, IT'S ANOTHER SLEEP APP, RIGHT?\n Not exactly. loóna isn’t a list of direct go-to-sleep techniques, but rather a mood-altering app that helps you to stay calm during the day and prepares you emotionally for going to sleep in the evening.\n\n- WHY IS BEDTIME MOOD IMPORTANT?\nNegative emotions we accumulate during the day are processed and consolidated by our brain during sleep making them more difficult to disassociate from when faced again in the future. Moreover, feeling angry, anxious, down, or, the opposite, excited, and elated, is likely to affect latencies to sleep onset and REM-sleep. People mistake it for the symptoms of a sleep disorder, but in reality, they just may be in the wrong mood for sleep.\n\n- HOW DOES LOÓNA WORK?\nFrom the wake up and during the busy day Loóna will support your emotional states with playlists and immersive stories. Each night you’ll have a recommended sleepscape. A sleepscape is a guided session that combines activity-based relaxation, storytelling, and sounds in a unique way. Complete it to shut the frantic world out, reset your mind, and create the perfect mood for sleep.\n\nLoóna saves your sleepscape sessions to your Apple Health app.\n\nThe upgrade to loóna PLUS provides access to the entire collection of sleepscapes. Our subscription options are: 1-month subscription for $12.99, 1-year subscription with a 7 day trial for $39.99 (price may vary by location).\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of service: http://loona.app/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://loona.app/privacy"

      "label": "BetterHelp is the convenient way to get professional help from a licensed therapist. With over 20,000 trained, experienced, and accredited therapists covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it.\n \n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 20,000 licensed, accredited, and highly experienced therapists\n• Match with an available therapist who best fits your needs\n• Unlimited private one on one communication with your therapist\n• Schedule live sessions with your therapist or use the secure messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars\n \nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional therapist has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n \nLICENSED AND TRAINED therapistS & THERAPISTS\nThere are over 20,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n \nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n \nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n \nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n \nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason."

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

In this case, the best idea is to go to a professional doctor or a pharmacy to do a pregnancy test, but if you want to have an approximate orientation before going, you can do the \"Am I pregnant quiz\" we have prepared.\n\nMain characteristics:\n- Before the first signs of pregnancy, if you want to know the approximate possibility to become pregnant, you can use this pregnancy test calculator to eliminate your doubts.\n- It is an online pregnancy test, focused on 15 questions about the signs of early pregnancy during the first weeks, which will give you a guiding result.\n- If you are tired of home pregnancy tests, you can try to take this questionnaire. You will have an approximate result by only responding to some simple questions related to the early pregnancy signs in first weeks of pregnancy.\n\nWhich kind of questions will you find in this home pregnancy test?\nAs we have explained before, all questions are focused on early pregnancy symptoms. Therefore, you will find some questions related to fatigue, irritability, sickness or vomiting, appetite, heartburn, constipation, etc. In short, a collection of the most relevant questions to be able to have an orientation about your situation.\nIf you ask yourself how to know whether you are pregnant, this app will help you to shed some light and have a rough idea. We hope that this free pregnancy test helps you in discovering a positive or negative pregnancy test result or whatever you are looking for.\nIf, on the contrary, you want to know how to get pregnant, this is not the aim of this app, therefore we recommend you to search for other apps or information of a professional doctor, since the aim of this app is to check your pregnancy status when having some sign of pregnancy to know whether you are pregnant or not.\n\nNote: This app is not a reliable pregnancy test, but simply a questionnaire to obtain an approximate result, but never definite. It is important that you go to the doctor or pharmacy for a 100% reliable result when experiencing signs of being pregnant.\n\nLegal note: This app and its content have been created by Smiko.

      "label": "Paidtogo is the original move to earn fitness tracker that pays you cash via Paypal or Bitcoin for every mile you walk or run. Users earn Paidtogo Coins which can be used to purchase payouts. Earn 10 Cents per mile and up to $75/month USD. We make tracking your fitness easy and rewarding. You can now sync with Apple Health and Fitbit, so you don't need to keep the app open and running in order to track your activities. Our goal is to motivate and incentivize you to walk and run more and drive less. So whether you are going for a jog, or you are walking to work, we think you will love using Paidtogo. \n\n*What people are saying*\n\n\"I just got paid! At first, I was a tad skeptical about this app. You have to really commit to using it long-term to see the benefits. I just got paid my June earnings, for both the Free and Pro Pools, and can say I definitely made a profit over what I spent on the Pro subscription! If you’re moderately active, it’s well worth it. Just make sure you check-in each day to sync your steps and update your standing on the leaderboard, and you can expect to get paid down the line! Super simple to use.\"\n\n\"Great App and very responsive developer! The app is a great idea and an amazing motivator. I recently had an issue with the app. The developer responded personally and had an update pushed out with a fix within 1 day! Amazing! I highly recommend. Update - I just received my first payout! What an awesome app!\" \n\nHow It Works:\n\nEarn 2 Coins per mile \n\nEarn up to 50 Coins per day\n\nEarn 10 Cents per mile and $75/month \n\nHow You Get Paid:\n\nPayments are made 4-5 weeks after the end of the month in which you purchase a Paypal or Bitcoin payout from the Paidtogo Store. This is how long we wait for the Payment from Apple to come in and another week to clear the Paypal deposit.\n\nHow Payments Are Distributed:\n\nPayouts are available when you have earned enough Paidtogo Coins and purchase a payout from the Paidtogo app\n\nCashing Out\n\nUsers can view available Payouts in the Paidtogo Store located in our app. The number of available payout units each month is determined by our revenue from in-app purchases and advertising. \n\nFitness Tracker Features:\n\nApple Sync\nFitbit Sync\nManual tracking\nPedometer\nstep counter/tracker\ntrack miles/KM\nCalorie Tracker\nGas saved\nCO2 offset\nRoute map\nLeaderboard\nStats \nCharts\nStep Tracker\n\nPaidtogo utilizes data from Apple Health for step tracking functionality. Please make sure you have approved Paidtogo in your Apple Health data authorizations.\n\nNOTE: We have advanced fraud detection in place. Those who attempt to game the system will be removed from the platform.\n\nPayments are based on units available each month. You must have your Paypal account and/or bitcoin wallet added to be paid. You must have an active subscription at the time we initiate the payout to qualify.\n\nGive us your feedback about how we can make the platform better at:\nEmail: support@paidtogo.com\nWebsite: www.Paidtogo.com\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.paidtogo.com/terms-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.paidtogo.com/privacy_policy"

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time?

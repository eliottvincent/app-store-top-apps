Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n\nTo have access to the \"I am Premium\" content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Powered by nature and innovative technology that personalizes your daily experience while keeping you in control of your cycle data.\n\n\nPainful Periods Aren't Natural\n\n\nBut they are common. Synthetic estrogens in birth control, plastics, and beauty products have created hormone imbalances for millions of women. 28's functional nutrition was designed to naturally restore balance to your hormones, along with phase-specific functional movements. \n\nWorkout With Your Cycle, Not Against It\n\n\nMany popular fitness methods were designed for men, not women, with no regard for the menstrual cycle. 28 is the first method of its kind designed to optimize your energy, hormones, strength, and flexibility as you experience changes throughout your cycle.\n\nYou Deserve More Than A Period Tracker\n\nYour cycle has four phases. Each phase brings changes to the brain and body. Exercising and eating based on your cycle means changing the types of movements and nutrients during each phase to optimize your physique, hormones, and mood. 28 empowers you with simplified science, breathtaking content, and cutting-edge technology. \n\nBecome the Expert of You\n\n\nYou are a mystery. Your body doesn’t have to be. We’ve been locked in the passenger seats of our own bodies for far too long. School taught us little-to-nothing about how our cycles and hormones actually work. 28 empowers you to connect with your body by understanding the beautifully complex nature of your biology, one day at a time.\n\n\n\nFEATURES: \n\nFollow Your Cycle\n  - Daily Cycle Status\n  - Easily Track Your Periods\n  - Phase Progress Bar \n\nScience-based Insights\n  - Daily body predictions\n  - Daily emotional predictions\n  - Goals, Guidance, and inspiration\n\nExercise Videos\n  - Personalized to match your energy and mood\n  - Designed by trainers of iconic supermodels\n  - Lengthen, strengthen, stretch & tone\n  - Sculpt booty, tighten abs, tone arms, lean legs\n  - Workout anywhere, at any time\n  - No equipment required\n  - Lightening-fast, high-definition streaming\n  - View on mobile, desktop, tablet, TV\n\nNutrition Profiles\n  - Daily nutrition guidelines for hormone balancing\n  - Specific suggestions by food groups \n  - Give your body what it needs, when it needs it\n  - No more calorie counting\n  - Coming Soon: Meal plans\n  - Coming soon: Shopping lists\n\nUser Privacy Is Our #1 Priority\n\nMany women have valid concerns regarding the privacy and safety of their personal health data. We're proud to have one of the strongest privacy policies in all of tech, which includes a steadfast commitment to never sell user cycle data to anyone for any reason and to never turn over user cycle data to any government or regulatory authority under any circumstance. We've intentionally built our algorithm to be manually controlled by the user at any time, as opposed to leveraging more invasive, machine learning methods. The only cycle data we currently collect is provided voluntarily by the user. It is also never shared with any existing or future investors. It is strictly confidential and used only for the purposes of providing a customized user experience. Any cycle data the user provides now or in the future can be changed or deleted by the user at any time. We do not store deleted cycle data. Once the user deletes that information, it is gone forever.\n\nEmbrace your nature and begin today!"

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "The Gratitude app is a carefully-designed self-care tool to help you focus on your mental health.\n\nWith a gratitude journal, affirmations, vision board, and daily motivation content, Gratitude provides you with all the tools and reminders you need to gain motivation and develop a healthy self-love routine in your life.\n\nTo live a happy and fulfilling life, it is important for us to have good mental health and a strong sense of self-love.\n\nAnd, as the app is completely private, you can always be assured that your precious journal entries, affirmations, and vision board are for your eyes only.\n\nHere are the tools that you will find in the Gratitude app:\n\n1. GRATITUDE JOURNAL\n\nA gratitude journal or diary opens up your eyes to reflect on all the little blessings in your life.\n\nIn daily life, we can lose sight of what we are fortunate to have and by keeping a journal you can slowly and steadily shift your perspective to focus on what is good in your life.\n\nThe Gratitude app will send you reminders with prompts to help you build the habit of journaling.\n\nYou can also add photos to your journal entries, build a gratitude journal streak, and access hundreds of journal prompts.\n\n2. POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS\n\nIf you’ve heard about manifestation or the law of attraction, you’ve probably heard about affirmations.\n\nPositive daily affirmations change our self-talk to focus on more loving and kind thoughts towards ourselves.\n\nThey give us the motivation we need to keep moving forward and believe in ourselves.\n\nThe Gratitude app has hundreds of affirmations that you can listen to or read, as per your need.\n\nYou can also write your own affirmations, add music, and record your voice to them.\n\nPositive affirmations are a dearly loved tool and with this affirmations app, it is very easy for you to practice them.\n\n3. CREATE VISION BOARDS\n\nAnother super popular manifestation tool is a vision board, also called a dream board. The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.\n\nIn the Gratitude app, we’ll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!\n\n4. DAILY ZEN\n\nWe understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app.\n\nHere, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.\n\n5. MINDFUL MINUTES\n\nWe define the Mindful minutes as the time that you spend in the Gratitude app. You can view the mindful minutes under 'All Health Data' section in the Health app provided by Apple. Currently, the app does not read any data from the health app. We don't write any data in the health app without your consent. You can turn on the mindful minutes from the profile & settings in the Gratitude app.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.notion.so/Gratitude-App-Privacy-Policy-40195d1e9f51499c82dc8f7d06ab2a1c\nTerms of Use: https://medium.com/@priteshsankhe/terms-and-conditions-c7a676f5d884"

      "label": "How often do you have negative thoughts repeating in your mind? Daily affirmations help change the way we think, give us confidence and self-esteem and replace the negativity with positive thoughts.\n\n\"I'm not good enough\", \"I can't get through this\", \"I just don't have the strength\".\nMany of us have negative thoughts like this, from time to time. Sometimes often. Thinking like this destroys our confidence, our sense of self-worth and eventually becomes reality. They become self-fulfilling prophecies. \nLuckily this works both ways. By repeating positive affirmations our brains slowly rewire themselves and we start to become the version of ourselves that we are meant to be.\n\nAffirmations are positive phrases that help you overcome negative thoughts. When you repeat them often and start believing in them, you start to change for the better. You might think that affirmations sound unrealistic or like “wishful thinking.\" But look at it this way: we all do repetitive exercises of some kind. Whether it be to improve our fitness or to learn a new skill, or practicing for a sport or an instrument. Affirmations are exercise for our brain. These positive mental repetitions can actually rewire our thinking patterns so that slowly, over time, we begin to act and think differently than before.\n\nThese are not just claims but have actual scientific merit. Research and evidence suggests that affirmations can help you perform better at work. Spending just a couple of minutes thinking about your best qualities as a person before a high-pressure situation, such as a presentation or performance review, can calm nervousness, increase confidence and improve the chance of a successful outcome.\nSelf-affirmation can also helps with managing stress. In one study, a short affirmation exercise improved the problem-solving abilities of people with chronic stress to the same level as those with low stress.\n\nBut don’t take our word for it! Download the app and try it for yourself. With our app you can:\n\nEmpower yourself.\n- Feel in control everyday as you build self-esteem and change negative thought patterns\n\nGet a tailored experience.\n- Change your mindset by focusing on the areas of life that are most important to you\n\nGet more than reminders.\n- Affirm your dreams and ambitions by creating a theme that truly resonates with you\n\nPrivacy Policy:  https://dailyaffirmationsab.github.io/privacy\nTerms of Use:  https://dailyaffirmationsab.github.io/terms"

In this case, the best idea is to go to a professional doctor or a pharmacy to do a pregnancy test, but if you want to have an approximate orientation before going, you can do the \"Am I pregnant quiz\" we have prepared.\n\nMain characteristics:\n- Before the first signs of pregnancy, if you want to know the approximate possibility to become pregnant, you can use this pregnancy test calculator to eliminate your doubts.\n- It is an online pregnancy test, focused on 15 questions about the signs of early pregnancy during the first weeks, which will give you a guiding result.\n- If you are tired of home pregnancy tests, you can try to take this questionnaire. You will have an approximate result by only responding to some simple questions related to the early pregnancy signs in first weeks of pregnancy.\n\nWhich kind of questions will you find in this home pregnancy test?\nAs we have explained before, all questions are focused on early pregnancy symptoms. Therefore, you will find some questions related to fatigue, irritability, sickness or vomiting, appetite, heartburn, constipation, etc. In short, a collection of the most relevant questions to be able to have an orientation about your situation.\nIf you ask yourself how to know whether you are pregnant, this app will help you to shed some light and have a rough idea. We hope that this free pregnancy test helps you in discovering a positive or negative pregnancy test result or whatever you are looking for.\nIf, on the contrary, you want to know how to get pregnant, this is not the aim of this app, therefore we recommend you to search for other apps or information of a professional doctor, since the aim of this app is to check your pregnancy status when having some sign of pregnancy to know whether you are pregnant or not.\n\nNote: This app is not a reliable pregnancy test, but simply a questionnaire to obtain an approximate result, but never definite. It is important that you go to the doctor or pharmacy for a 100% reliable result when experiencing signs of being pregnant.\n\nLegal note: This app and its content have been created by Smiko.

In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

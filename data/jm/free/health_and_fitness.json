      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Current effects include brighten, contrast, grayscale, invert, exposure, gamma, hue, saturation and sharpen and we are continuing to work on adding more features!\n\nWe also provide a community where you can share photos of your tests or other TTC-related photos that other users can vote and comment on. You can also do the same for others!\n\nWe realize how stressful and frustrating the process of becoming pregnant can be, especially for those of you that have tried so hard and yearn for that pregnancy test to finally be positive after months or even years of disappointment. As such, we added a baby dust feature that we hope will provide a little comfort and encouragement to you during your journey to become pregnant.\n\nShould you run into any issues, we would sincerely appreciate it if you could send feedback to us first in the app instead of leaving a negative review and we will work to address your issue as quickly as possible.

Get to bed on-time with Rain Rain's Bedtime Reminder by setting the time and days you want a reminder. Rain Rain sends you a gentle, encouraging message when it is time to go to bed so that you can get the rest you deserve.\n\nOSCILLATOR: Customize your experience with the Oscillator, which slowly fades a sound in and out, allowing you to create dynamic, varying soundscapes in concert with the Mixer. You can even adjust how fast the Oscillator changes the volume. When you save a Mix to your Favorites, your Oscillator settings are saved as well, allowing you to save and recall any number of custom soundscapes.\n\nSOFTEN: Adjust the tone of each sound to suit your needs with Soften, which reduces the high frequencies of any sound by an amount you choose. This makes the sound seem as if it is coming from another room or outside, as sometimes you want to sleep with rain outside, not pouring on your head. Soften takes care of any worries about the sound being harsh, tinny, or hissy when played on small speakers or even the built-in iPhone or iPad speakers. Your chosen levels for Soften are stored when you save a Mix to your Favorites to help you create the perfect scenes.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.rainrainapp.com/tou\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.rainrainapp.com/privacy\n\nDownload Rain Rain today and get a better night's sleep tonight!"

      "label": "How often do you have negative thoughts repeating in your mind? Daily affirmations help change the way we think, give us confidence and self-esteem and replace the negativity with positive thoughts.\n\n\"I'm not good enough\", \"I can't get through this\", \"I just don't have the strength\".\nMany of us have negative thoughts like this, from time to time. Sometimes often. Thinking like this destroys our confidence, our sense of self-worth and eventually becomes reality. They become self-fulfilling prophecies. \nLuckily this works both ways. By repeating positive affirmations our brains slowly rewire themselves and we start to become the version of ourselves that we are meant to be.\n\nAffirmations are positive phrases that help you overcome negative thoughts. When you repeat them often and start believing in them, you start to change for the better. You might think that affirmations sound unrealistic or like “wishful thinking.\" But look at it this way: we all do repetitive exercises of some kind. Whether it be to improve our fitness or to learn a new skill, or practicing for a sport or an instrument. Affirmations are exercise for our brain. These positive mental repetitions can actually rewire our thinking patterns so that slowly, over time, we begin to act and think differently than before.\n\nThese are not just claims but have actual scientific merit. Research and evidence suggests that affirmations can help you perform better at work. Spending just a couple of minutes thinking about your best qualities as a person before a high-pressure situation, such as a presentation or performance review, can calm nervousness, increase confidence and improve the chance of a successful outcome.\nSelf-affirmation can also helps with managing stress. In one study, a short affirmation exercise improved the problem-solving abilities of people with chronic stress to the same level as those with low stress.\n\nBut don’t take our word for it! Download the app and try it for yourself. With our app you can:\n\nEmpower yourself.\n- Feel in control everyday as you build self-esteem and change negative thought patterns\n\nGet a tailored experience.\n- Change your mindset by focusing on the areas of life that are most important to you\n\nGet more than reminders.\n- Affirm your dreams and ambitions by creating a theme that truly resonates with you\n\nPrivacy Policy:  https://dailyaffirmationsab.github.io/privacy\nTerms of Use:  https://dailyaffirmationsab.github.io/terms"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

You can change pictures quickly & playfully & get closer & closer to your vision of your dream life. Your vision board doesn't stay the same, you adapt it over time until it exactly matches your vision of the future.\n\nWith this app, you can easily combine your own photos with images from the web or thousands of images provided by us. You can accompany them with positive affirmations & emotional music for better results. The app combines them & creates an inspiring, personalized vision board video clip for you.

Then you experience the film of your life in the physical world (outside), your desires and goals manifest themselves. One of the best & easiest ways to do this is to experience your personalized vision board.\n\nWith our 1800+ positive SELF AFFIRMATIONS & MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES you immediately start to develop a positive mindset. You can put them on your home screen (widget) to stay positive throughout the day.\n\nAt the end of each day you can use your personal GRATITUDE JOURNAL to reflect on your progress and to focus your attention on the positive things to attract more of them.\nWhatever you frequently focus upon, the law of attraction brings to you in areas such as:\n*Health *Weight Loss *Body Positivity *Sleep & Relaxation *Work & Career * Wealth & Lifestyle * Family * Partnership * Spirituality\r\n\nHere is how you can benefit:\n*You’ll develop a clearer sense of what is truly important to you & what you want to have more of in life\n*You'll become more mindful, present & aware of your positive surroundings & you will attract more of them\n*You’ll start being highly motivated & fully focused\n*You’ll feel more balanced\n*You’ll grow self-confidence as you become more mindful of your achievements\n*On days when you are feeling down, it helps you recalibrate your thought patterns in a positive way\n\nSuccessful athletes, artists & managers use a vision board for visualization every day to reach their peak performance.

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in.

Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "To get the perfect hourglass body shape, you need to work your entire body, get in shape and drop any excess fat to showcase the right places on your body. In order to look in the mirror and see an enviable hourglass frame with curves in all the right places, it’s crucial to not only target your waist but your hips as well. And flattening your stomach while carving out a defined midline calls for working your entire core, butt, and thighs. This routine uses a variety of next-level planks that work muscles from head to toe as well as twisting action to shrink your waist.\n\nThis program incorporates daily waist training with core-strengthening exercises to give you that hourglass silhouette. The workouts have been highly researched and tested to make sure that you get results within that time period. The workouts are pretty simple and are the same through out the 30 days. The only thing that changes is the number of reps each week. They start out low on the first week then they increase each week after that. The goal is to strengthen your core while burning fat in your midsection. If you stick to the guide you will get results.\n\nThis is a 4-week transformation challenge and can be done training at your home or at the gym.\nAn hourglass shape is a body type where the hips and bust are wide relative to the size of the waist. This body type has recently regained popularity and is known as the sort of quintessential symbol of a woman, and a staggering portion of the population, both male and female, prefers the hourglass figure to any other body shape. Women who naturally have these types of figures will find that when they gain weight, it happens first in the hips and bust. If you aren’t a natural hourglass shape but want to be, the exercises in this workout can help.\r\n\r\nThe moves in this routine are hourglass exercises, in a sense, that can comprehensively get the body to look more voluptuous in the hips and chest, and tinier in the waistline. To get a lean and curvy shape, it takes a total body workout."

This makes the sound seem as if it is coming from another room or outside, as sometimes you want to sleep with rain outside, not pouring on your head. Soften takes care of any worries about the sound being harsh, tinny, or hissy when played on small speakers or even the built-in iPhone or iPad speakers. Your chosen levels for Soften are stored when you save a Mix to your Favorites to help you create the perfect scenes.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.rainrainapp.com/tou\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.rainrainapp.com/privacy\n\nDownload Rain Rain today and get a better night's sleep tonight!"

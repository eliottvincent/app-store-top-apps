      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

ZeusHealth App offers personalized training programs helping to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles that support the uterus, the bladder, and bowel. \r\n\r\nInstall ZeusHealth now and start your daily workouts to gain more control over your pelvic floor (PF). The weekly and daily training plan based on your health is easy to stick with and consists of effective exercises.\r\n \r\n  \r\nHow does the ZEUS app work?\n\n\r\n- The app is based on the pelvic floor muscle enhancement technique\r\n- After estimating your health condition, the app creates a personalized training program based on your needs and state of health.\r\n- You'll be able to exercise while doing any daily routine: driving, standing in line, or working. No one around you will ever notice.\r\n- The app will remind you to train, show your progress and tips to improve your training routine. \r\n \r\n10 benefits of using the ZEUS app\n\n\r\n1. \tEvaluation of your health with a smart algorithm\r\n2. \tCreation of a personalized workout plan\r\n3. \tEasy-to-do workouts that take just 5 minutes a day\r\n4. \tDetailed step-by-step explanations of the exercises\r\n5. \t10 difficulty levels\r\n6. \tSmooth workout intensity increase\r\n7. \tReminder function\r\n8. \tProgress tracker\r\n9. \tHelpful information, tips, lots of interesting articles, and insights\r\n10.  100% privacy protection\r\n \r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n \r\nZeusHealth programs are based on Kegel exercises. Hundreds of scientific studies prove that Kegel exercises (also: Kegels, PF exercises) have a positive long-lasting effect on men’s health.\r\n \r\nKegels target pelvic floor muscles. These muscles tend to weaken over time, negatively affecting men’s health. Doing Kegel exercises regularly helps men of all ages to strengthen their PF muscles, and gain more control of their bladder and perineal muscles. \r\n \r\nWhy choose ZeusHealth?\r\n \r\nWhen performing Kegel exercises, it's vital to choose the right set of exercises and do them regularly. Therefore, we've collected all the necessary types of Kegel exercises in a functional and comfortable-to-use app to make them more accessible and adjusted to your needs. The app will create your personal training program, show what type of exercises you need to do, and explain how to do the exercise for better results. In addition to Kegel exercises, our app has a bunch of helpful articles and tips on general men’s health.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nBilling Terms\n\n\r\n\r\nOur standard subscription options are:\r\n1 month subscription - $19.99\r\n3 months subscription - $29.99\r\n1 year subscription - $ 69.99\r\n\r\n\nSubscription unlocks all workout programs and additional functionality. The subscription automatically renews after free trial ends (if applicable), unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\r\nYour Apple ID payment method will be charged when the purchase is confirmed.\r\n\nThe subscription renews automatically at the end of each period, until you cancel.\r\nTo avoid being charged, cancel the subscription in your Apple ID account settings at least 24 hours before the end of the trial or the current subscription period. Deleting the application does not cancel your subscription.\r\n\r\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\r\n\r\n\nThe price indicated is for United States customers. Pricing in other countries depends on the country of your residence and may be converted to your local currency.\r\n\r\n\nTerms of Use: https://zeushealth.org/terms-of-service.html\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://zeushealth.org/privacy-policy.html"

      "label": "Hourglass exercises for a curvy body are predominately going to consist of moves that target the obliques, or the transverse abdominals muscles. An hourglass figure typically consists of a smaller waist balanced by a larger bust and curvier hips. The emphasis of what you work on will depend on your natural shape.If you’re already slim all around, you may want to start by building muscle around your shoulders and chest area to get broader on top. If you carry weight around your midsection, you’ll likely want to prioritize whittling that away.\n\nSince it’s hard to spot-reduce fat in just one area of your body, it’s important to focus on overall weight loss if you want to drop inches from your waist. But there are some exercises and workouts that have been proven to be more successful at targeting fat around your midsection. Our workout plans will help you to tone your body with curves in all the right places. The exercises will flatten your stomach, shrink your waist to provide a small waistline, tone your thighs, make your butt rounder and hips wider."

To forecast ovulation Period Tracker calculates 14 days before the projected start date of one's next period. Forecast accuracy depends on a number of factors including how regular one's cycle length is, when one actually ovulates during the cycle, and how many periods have been logged in the app. Anxiety, stress, diet, nutrition, exercise, environment, medications, age and other factors can also affect one's cycle from month to month. \n\nPlease email comments and suggestions to supportgpa@gmail.com."

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

      "label": "Your glutes, hips and thighs includes some of the most important, and powerful, muscles in the human body. Aside from wanting a firm, shapely butt, it's important to train your lower body simply because they're involved in so many movements. Sit, stand, squat and walk and your glutes are working, and think about how many times you do that in one day.\r\n\r\nStrength training exercises not only make you stronger for daily activities, they can also make you strong for other activities like running, walking, working in the yard and climbing stairs. Working these muscles means you'll not only build strength and lean-muscle tissue, but you'll also burn more calories.\n\nIf you were to survey a handful of women about the areas they’d most like to tone, the butt and thighs would probably rate highly. And while looking fantastic from behind is always appealing, a strong butt and thighs are really important for overall fitness and stability.\n\nStrengthening the butt and thighs can reduce back pain, improve posture, strengthen your pelvis and reduce knee and ankle strain. Incorporating exercises that target the lower body also increases overall body strength and function to support daily movements such as bending, lifting, twisting and moving.\r The exercises we’ve selected are fantastic for tightening and toning your bottom and thighs and can be done from the comfort of your own home."

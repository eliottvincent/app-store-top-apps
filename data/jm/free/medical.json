The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

It will work without an external microphone but please be-aware that results may vary as the voice pitch analysis requires a relatively quiet environment and some phone microphones can pickup a lot of background noise.  \n\nThis tool is designed to act as a voice recorder/playback/analyser tool but with useful information such as voice pitch, tones, & volume with resonance and phonetics to be added at a later date. It is mostly intended for use as part of voice therapy, and users should be aiming to use the tool for about 5 minutes a day over several months.  It does not provide lessons or guidance, it is intended to be used as a tool to assist with voice therapy and not as a replacement for voice therapy.\n\n=Privacy=\nNo voice recordings are saved or leave the device.\n\n=Free=\nThis app is available in two flavors; a free advert supported version, and a paid advert-free version.  You can remove the adverts via an in-app purchase in the settings screen.\n\n=Bugs=\nHelp us to improve this app, if it doesn't work, or you have any ideas to help us improve please drop us an email so that we can improve things in the next release!"

      "label": "Help when you need it, for those with seizure disorders. \n\nSeizAlarm is a user-friendly iPhone and Apple Watch app that allows those with epilepsy and other seizure disorders to alert emergency contacts when they need help*.  \n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Seizure detection.  Seizure-like detection is done via the motion sensors on the iPhone and/or motion sensors or heart rate sensor on the Apple Watch.  Sensitivity controls allow you to set customized settings specific to you.  When a potential seizure is detected, emergency contacts will automatically be contacted via multiple channels (text message, phone call, and email). \n\n- Send immediate help requests manually to emergency contacts. \n\n- Also available is a manually activated time delayed help request feature (via the \"Time Delayed Help\" button) that is helpful for those that have localized seizures (auras) that may turn into generalized tonic-clonic seizures. You are able to custom set the delay time in the settings.  When a seizure warning is initiated you will see a countdown which can be extended via the press of a button.  If you end up becoming unresponsive due to a seizure then once the timer ends then a help request will be sent.\n\n- When a help request is sent your contacts will be contacted with GPS coordinates (if available), so they know exactly where you are.  \n\n- You can are also able to track your seizure events with robust logging features. A log dashboard gives you a high-level view of past events.  You can also export reports to provide to your doctor. \n\n- SeizAlarm also supports multiple emergency contact support, so more than one person can be contacted when you need help. \n\n- Optional audible siren and/or custom voice message that plays if a help request is sent.\n\n- International phone number support for emergency contact(s).\n\n- Now supporting \"Family Setup\" watches! \n\nHelp is just a button press away. Start taking back your independence today.\n\nPlease give us feedback on how the seizure detection is working for you.  The more feedback we receive will provide us with the information we need to improve detection and reduce false alarms in future versions.\n\nIf you have any questions or have feedback, please contact us at: contact@seizalarm.com.  We want to make SeizAlarm the best that it can be, so feedback from our users is very important to us.\n\nNOTES:\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n- Recommended placement of the iPhone for seizure detection is on the arm using an arm band.\n- Long use of Watch based seizure-like motion and elevated heart rate detection may dramatically decrease watch battery life.\n\n\n*New accounts receive a 2 week trial of the \"Alerts\" service which allows the user to manually or automatically (via seizure-like motion detection) request help from emergency contacts.  Once the trial ends, the user must subscribe to the \"Alerts\" service to continue to have the ability to request help.  The \"Alerts\" service is an auto-renewing cost of $14.99/month or $149.99/year.  \n\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\n* The payment will be charged to the user's iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.  The account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.  \n\n* Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.  \n\n* No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period.  Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.  The robust seizure log features require no subscription.\n\nPrivacy policy: http://www.seizalarm.com/seizalarm_app-privacy-policy.pdf\nEnd User License Agreement: http://www.seizalarm.com/seizalarm_EULA.pdf"

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device.

Then, a 10 Band Equalizer in the app amplifies the sounds to your listening convenience.\n\nYou need a pair of wired or Bluetooth earbuds to play this app. The EarPods shipped with new iPhones work well. Bluetooth earbuds, including AirPods and AirPods Pro, are fine too. For best performance, the ear tips on AirPods Pro should create a complete seal when placed in your ears. Likewise, EarPods and AirPods must form a tight fit to your ears.\n\nAirPods and AirPods Pro include microphones for both ears, and their users can choose which microphone should be active. This is significant if you have single-sided deafness. You can place the AirPod with the active microphone in your deaf ear, and the other in your hearing ear. This app then captures sounds with AirPod in the deaf ear, amplifies, and crosses to AirPod in the hearing ear.\n\nIf you have hearing loss in both ears, you can use the Head Shadow app with any earbuds. The iPhone microphone is your best option for capturing the sounds, which leads to two ways to listen to the sounds. You can play the sounds on wired earbuds, like the original EarPods. This way, the wires are limiting, but you get the best sound output and latency. Or you can use any Bluetooth earbuds, for example, AirPods. You will enjoy the freedom of movement at a cost of a small inherent latency.\n\nThe Headphone Accommodations feature of iOS 14 is a free audio booster for all hearing aids. Your media and phone calls will sound crisper when you set up this feature with Apple EarPods. With AirPods Pro, you can set up using the audiogram data from your hearing test. This allows you to use the Noise Cancellation option for better hearing in noisy places. Use the Transparency option and appreciate sounds around you, with or without a hearing aid.\n\nThe iOS 14, and this app, amplify sounds with audiogram frequencies. When you use the AirPods Pro, iOS is doing the noise cancellation, and this app is not using iPhone resources. Instead, this app can fine-tune sounds when needed.\n\nHead Shadow app is an AirPods Pro hearing aid if you have single-sided deafness. Set your AirPods Pro to Transparency Mode and listen to sounds from people around you, amplified and enhanced. Set them to Noise Cancellation Mode and hear someone on the side of your deaf ear, perfectly clear.\n\nHead Shadow app provides four hearing programs when you first start. You can select the best program for the current hearing condition while listening, live, to a sound source. You can further refine the output of the selected program by our 10 Band Equalizer - EQ while listening to the sound. The app saves this refined program on the iPhone storage space and continues to use it until the next refinement.\n\nWe designed this app for the best user experience. We emphasize the ease and simplicity of use, accessibility, and optimum use of the iPhone battery. The app works in the background mode and responds to remote controls from the Lock Screen.\n\nYou can download and use this app for 30 days, free with no obligation to purchase. After that, you may purchase the app for a nominal one-time payment, no subscriptions are required.\n\nUse the App Support link on this page to open the app’s website support page, where you can contact the developer. We appreciate your comments and feedback.\n\nThe Head Shadow app is not a substitute for a hearing aid with a doctor’s prescription. Play the app with the audio volume set to a low level, then increase to a comfortable hearing level. For more information, check the app’s Privacy Policy link on this page."

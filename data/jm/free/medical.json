Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device.

In other words, the ultimate job flexibility. \n\nOur nursing jobs app provides easy and direct access to thousands of open nursing shifts at healthcare facilities near you. As a ShiftMed healthcare professional, you’re essentially your own boss.  \n\nAs a ShiftMed caregiver, you get to: \n- Maintain a work schedule that meets your personal and professional needs. \n- Care for patients in a variety of healthcare settings, including skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. \n- Work per diem any time of the day or night—weekends and holidays are optional. \n- Choose to work 8 hours one week and 40 the next—no shift minimums. \n- Claim Guaranteed Shifts® to get paid for the ENTIRE shift if the facility cancels. \n- Access our FREE Next Day Pay® service to get paid the next business day.  \n- Enjoy competitive pay, bonuses, holiday rates, and promotional perks. \n\nHow ShiftMed Works \nTo use our nursing jobs app, you must hold an active CNA, GNA, STNA, LPN, or RN license and complete our onboarding process. Once you’re approved to claim shifts, the app gives you direct access to thousands of open shifts at healthcare facilities in your area, including long-term care facilities, assisted living communities, skilled nursing facilities, hospitals, and more! \n\nClaiming Shifts \nIt’s easy to create the ideal work schedule using our nurse staffing app. You can filter your shift feed based on your preferred start time, distance from your home, hourly rate, and even your favorite facility.  \nWhen you claim a shift, the app notifies the healthcare facility directly. So, there’s no waiting for us to approve anything. And should something unexpected come up, you can cancel a shift directly in the app.    \n\nEmployment Status \nWhen working in the medical field through ShiftMed, you’re a W-2 employee—not a 1099 contractor.

This HIPAA compliant solution allows clinicians to remotely monitor an unlimited number of patients and see who most needs their attention and who is doing well, all with a click of button. \n\nQardioDirect App:\n\n• Gives healthcare professionals an additional way to onboard new patients easily\n• Works with Qardio devices for in-clinic and at-home measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, ECG, heart rate, irregular heartbeat detection, blood oxygen level, temperature, weight, BMI and full body composition\n• Lets doctors demonstrate Qardio products to patients\n\nHow it works:\n\nPatients use FDA-cleared Qardio devices to monitor their health outside the doctor's office, which automatically share vitals with their provider.\n\nProviders use HIPAA-compliant QardioMD services. When a patient takes a measurement, the data is displayed in the secure QardioMD web portal.\n\nQardio does the rest. QardioMD continuously displays patient data, and with easy to use filters shows who needs priority attention.\n\nQardioDirect and Apple Health work seamlessly together, enabling easier health tracking with all your health and wellness information in one place. \n\nWhat other doctors have to say about Qardio:\n\n“I believe that good, high quality home blood pressure monitoring devices are going to be critical for achieving better blood pressure control in the US population. I’ve been very impressed with the QardioArm device, which we are currently using in the Health eHeart Study.” - Mark Pletcher, Health eHeart Study Principal Investigator, UCSF\n\n“As a physician, I believe people need to take control of their health and outcomes and this product being so easy to use, portable and most importantly accurate is a product I would recommend to all. Since stopping my denial and becoming a patient myself, I have done just that. Folks, the newest data regarding BP is irrefutable and having just one reading at a doctor’s office every so often is, in my opinion, the wrong way to detect hypertension and products like these should become part of a person's routine, especially as we age and our vessels become less compliant.” HB, Physician and QardioArm User, Amazon Review.\n\nQardioArm and QardioCore have regulatory clearance in the United States, European Economic Area, Canada. Qardio’s products and application should be only used in conjunction with professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and not as a substitute, or a replacement for it."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Simply press a button to randomize the entire eye chart, or touch an individual line of the chart to randomize that line. Swipe right for the chart selector.\n\nEye care professionals around the world use Snellen Eye Charts to measure visual acuity. However, patients often memorize the classic Snellen chart, leading to less accurate vision measurements. Enter Eye Chart HD! Though this unique, pocket-sized randomizable eye chart should not be used as a primary visual acuity measuring tool, it can provide a handy rough vision screen when a chart is not available, or it can be used to complement static, wall-based Snellen charts.\n\nSubscription:\n\nIn addition to our free features, Eye Chart HD offers a subscription to exclusive paid features, including the Randomizable Near Vision Chart, Line Isolation, Amsler Grid, and Single Optotype Charts! The subscription costs $2.99 per month of access and has to be purchased specially within the app. Once purchased, it is available through an auto-renewing subscription which will renew each month for your convenience until you choose to turn it off. Please let us know if you have any questions about your subscription at eyechartapp@gmail.com.\n\nCheck out our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy at https://eyechartproapp.com/tos.html\n\nEye Chart HD was made with the best of intentions, and we hope to continue improving it.

For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

The next chapters review in detail the radiological anatomy of specific anatomical structures, also provide examples of how the x-ray image can change due to pathology. The final chapter explains how the individual structures come together to form the radiological image.\n \nSection III* starts with a chapter on how to interpret the chest x-ray; this is where you begin to put your new knowledge into practice. Now that you know what to look for, you can do so in a systematic way to ensure the accurate identification of pathology.\n \nSpecial content:\n \nHow To’s – 34 step-by-step guides, with annotated x-rays, to illustrate key skills needed to confidentially interpret chest x-ray.\n \nVisual Searches – 8 visual guides to illustrate the sequential checks that should be performed in a visual search of given anatomical structure or radiological zone on a chest x-ray.\n \nRadiological Checklist – 12 illustrated list of items that should be evaluated for a given anatomical structure or radiological zone, in the process of interpreting a chest x-ray.\n \nRadiological Anatomy – Descriptions of various anatomical structures as they would appear on PA and lateral chest x-rays.\n \nCase Studies – Practical and Clinical Case Studies collected from the whole app help check current skills.\n \nPathology – Numerous interesting examples of pathology related to specific anatomical structures and regions.\n\nVisit our website to explore interesting radiology cases and interviews\nhttps://empendium.com/chestxrayinterpretation\n \nJoin our virtual community!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Chest-X-Ray-Interpretation-148899650663033\n \nPlease note:\n- A network connection is required to download additional figures and audio descriptions."

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "Just place a finger over the camera for two minutes, and StressScan will analyze changes in your heart rate and scientifically measure the level of your mental and physical stress on a scale of 1 to 100.\nStress is the root cause of many illnesses. Measure your stress to manage it!\n\n- What is the principle behind StressScan? − \nMany of the functions essential to maintaining human health are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is medically recognized that the balance of the autonomic nervous system can become disordered through fatigue and other stress, stemming from causes such as work and human relationships. By analyzing the waveform of your heartbeat as measured at the fingertip, StressScan can analyze the balance of your autonomic nervous system and measure your stress level on a stress index of 1 to 100.\n\n- You can trust StressScan! - \nThe technology used by StressScan is based on heart rate variability analysis, which is widely recognized in the field of heart rate analysis and autonomic nervous system research. \nAlthough heart rate variability analysis technology is not yet generally well known, many medical institutions and companies have taken an interest and are beginning to put it to use. The technology is seeing use even at the cutting edge of stress care, including adoption by the US military to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers returning from the battlefield, and by NASA for astronaut training and health management.\n\n- Usable in a range of scenarios! - \n· Periodic checking of daily stress level\n· Checking the effects of favorite meals and drinks on stress\n· Checking relaxation while traveling or at a favorite spot\n\n- Device compatibility -\nThe app is intended for use with a camera- and flash-equipped smartphone. It is not usable with devices that do not have a camera and flash.\n\n- Usage environment -\nAn Internet connection is required to use the app. External support for measurement functions is used for complex stress analysis."

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

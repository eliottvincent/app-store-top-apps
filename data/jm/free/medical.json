      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

In other words, the ultimate job flexibility. \n\nOur nursing jobs app provides easy and direct access to thousands of open nursing shifts at healthcare facilities near you. As a ShiftMed healthcare professional, you’re essentially your own boss.  \n\nAs a ShiftMed caregiver, you get to: \n- Maintain a work schedule that meets your personal and professional needs. \n- Care for patients in a variety of healthcare settings, including skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. \n- Work per diem any time of the day or night—weekends and holidays are optional. \n- Choose to work 8 hours one week and 40 the next—no shift minimums. \n- Claim Guaranteed Shifts® to get paid for the ENTIRE shift if the facility cancels. \n- Access our FREE Next Day Pay® service to get paid the next business day.  \n- Enjoy competitive pay, bonuses, holiday rates, and promotional perks. \n\nHow ShiftMed Works \nTo use our nursing jobs app, you must hold an active CNA, GNA, STNA, LPN, or RN license and complete our onboarding process. Once you’re approved to claim shifts, the app gives you direct access to thousands of open shifts at healthcare facilities in your area, including long-term care facilities, assisted living communities, skilled nursing facilities, hospitals, and more! \n\nClaiming Shifts \nIt’s easy to create the ideal work schedule using our nurse staffing app. You can filter your shift feed based on your preferred start time, distance from your home, hourly rate, and even your favorite facility.  \nWhen you claim a shift, the app notifies the healthcare facility directly. So, there’s no waiting for us to approve anything. And should something unexpected come up, you can cancel a shift directly in the app.    \n\nEmployment Status \nWhen working in the medical field through ShiftMed, you’re a W-2 employee—not a 1099 contractor.

Remember details such as when symptoms began, how high the fever got, or when to give another dose of medication and share it with another caregiver or your doctor. Temperature data integrates seamlessly with HealthKit and the Health app.\n\nWHAT PARENTS ARE SAYING\n“The app tracks and organizes our family’s temps and symptoms and keeps the history. This is a wonderful app for a busy and sleep deprived mom!” \n“Hands down my favorite feature is that the app gives you suggestions on how to keep your little one comfortable and gives practical advice for a speedy recovery!”\n“The Kinsa app keeps all my data in one place and makes doctors appointments a breeze…”\n“We are a family of 6! Kinsa helps us keep track of everyone’s medical situation!”\n“This has to be one of the best products on the market for families, especially families with little ones!” \n\nThe free Kinsa app works best with Kinsa's award-winning, pediatrician-recommended QuickCare, QuickScan, and Smart Ear thermometers, available for purchase online and in retail stores across the U.S. If you have an older Smart Stick thermometer that plugs into the headphone jack of your phone, please use the Kinsa Smart Stick app instead. \n\nWe hope your family doesn't get sick, but if they do, we'll be there to help your family feel better faster!\n\nAll information, images, and other content shared through Kinsa’s mobile or web applications is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment from an appropriately qualified and licensed physician or other healthcare provider.

Beginning with the patient’s presenting symptoms, they ultimately narrow down multiple options to one condition.  The DSM-5 Differential Diagnosis Handbook can play a critical role in this process by improving the diagnostic process of psychiatric conditions.  Leveraging latest DSM-5 classifications from the American Psychiatric Association, users are able to use a trusted 6-step process when dealing with, sometimes unfamiliar, psych conditions.  \n\nExclusive, integrated interactive decision trees provide a step-by-step process of asking yes or no questions to find a tentative diagnosis.  When the initial diagnosis is reached, tables of differential diagnoses are presented to help confirm or present new options.  \n\nFEATURES\n• Interactive decision trees for narrowing down psychiatric diagnoses\n• Algorithms for enhanced assessment\n• The latest DSM-5 classifications and ICD-10 codes\n• Helpful tables of differential diagnoses\n• Detailed entries featuring definitions for each psychiatric condition\n• Expansive guidance on all 6 steps of the differential diagnosis process \n• Advanced Search to help find topics quickly \n• “Favorites” for bookmarking important entries\n\nAuthor: Michael B.

      "label": "Decide + Be Ready - an interactive way to learn about birth control options and think through what’s important to you about your method.  You’ve got to love options, especially when it comes to birth control, but figuring out the best method for you can be overwhelming.  In 15 minutes or less, you’ll have the information you need to discuss options with your health care provider in order to make the best decision for you! \n\nFEATURES include:\n\n1) Brief educational modules reviewing all the birth control methods out there, including:\n\nHow well does it prevent pregnancy?\nHow do I use it?\nHow often do I have to remember it?\nAre there any side effects?\nWhat if I decide to get pregnant?\nConsiderations for a servicewoman\n\n2) “Info quickies” that provide information about such topics as emergency contraception, IUDs, postpartum and breastfeeding considerations, and fertility awareness methods.\n\n3) An interactive section that allows you to indicate your preferences for the method characteristics described above. \n\n4) A short checklist assessing your medical eligibility for different contraceptive methods.\n\n5) Recommendations on methods that may be a good fit for you based on your responses to items 3 and 4 above.  You can then select the methods that you wish to discuss at more length with your provider.  You can also use the “Compare Methods” function to view all the characteristics of two methods side-by-side.\n\n6) A notepad to write down questions you have for your provider.\n\n7) Your Birth Control Profile that summarizes and allows you to share your method preferences, questions you wish to ask your provider, and methods you are most interested in. You can save your profile, email it to yourself or share with your provider.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nDecide + Be Ready will cover important basics about all the methods out there and ask you questions about what you want from birth control (like how you want to use it, how often you want to think about it, and what side effects are going to bother you or make your life better), so you can find the ones that work for you.  The app will also allow you to compare methods side by side, and capture questions you have for your provider. Even if you already have a method in mind, it is good to know your options.  \n\nDecide + Be Ready can be used by anyone.  However, it was specifically developed to meet the unique needs of women in the military.  These servicewomen, when deployed or working in uniquely challenging environments, have additional things to think when choosing a birth control method, like access to methods, or the advantages of being able to manage or even skip their menstrual periods with certain methods. Physical and emotional readiness is critical for the military mission and this app will help servicewomen “be ready” in more ways than one!\n\nDecide + Be Ready is straightforward to use and will guide you through a flow of information and questions that result in tailored recommendations based on your preferences.\n\nDecide + Be Ready was developed jointly by faculty at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), the Person-Centered Reproductive Health Program at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and Nitid Bit, LLC.   It is sponsored and maintained by the Defense Health Agency (DHA).\nThe contents, views or opinions expressed in this application are those of the developers and do not necessarily reflect official policy or position of Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, the Department of Defense (DoD), or Departments of the Army, Navy, or Air Force.

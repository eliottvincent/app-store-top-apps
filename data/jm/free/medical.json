      "label": "Join the millions of medical professionals who use MDCalc daily to support clinical decision making at the bedside. Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "ABG Expert™ is simply the best acid-base analysis tool with features available in no other app. Designed and tested by practicing physicians, ABG Expert is trusted by medical professionals for unparalleled accuracy, flexibility, and power while remaining completely intuitive to use. \n\n\nWhether you are a physician, nurse, respiratory therapist, paramedic, or student, ABG Expert is your ideal acid base analysis app. \n\n\nABG Expert is being offered FREE for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\nAccuracy- \n\n• ABG Expert has been validated using extensive testing under real-world conditions.\n\n• No need to worry about entering physiologically impossible data by mistake. Data is checked for plausibility and for internal consistency using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\n• An accurate analysis depends on an accurate anion gap. ABG Expert has you covered with automatic correction of the anion gap when albumin is provided. \n\n• Never again wonder about how a result was obtained. Detailed explanations include easy-to-understand equations so you can be sure the calculations are correct. \n\n\nFlexibility- \n\n• Need the arterial blood gas analysis, but not the anion gap or A-a gradient? No problem. ABG Expert can analyze the data for all three results separately or together. \n\n• Set the normal anion gap range based on the normal range at your institution. Or, use your patient’s own baseline anion gap to maximize your sensitivity to detect disorders. \n\n• Caring for an 80-year-old patient in Denver? Provide age and barometric pressure, and ABG Expert automatically adjusts interpretation of the A-a gradient.  \n\n• Need more specificity? Adjust the normal delta gap range based on the literature you follow in your practice. \n\n• ABG Expert works as well in Bangkok as it does in Boston with full support for SI and non-SI units. \n\n\nPower- \n\n• Color-coded results allow for rapid analysis in critical situations. One additional click gives you a detailed differential diagnosis and additional recommendations. \n\n• Concerned about a new problem in your patient with advanced COPD? ABG Expert can adjust its calculations for chronic respiratory conditions so you can detect additional disorders that are missed by other apps. \n\n• Detailed explanations of disorders integrate ABG, anion gap, and A-a gradient results providing individualized answers like no textbook can. \n\n• Refine your differential diagnosis even further with the included osmolal gap and urine anion gap calculators.\n\n• Optimize your patient's ventilator settings with the included calculator that automatically populates with your patient's ABG data.\n\n• ABG Expert combines beauty and brains with optimization for iOS devices running iOS 13 and later. \n\n\nDisclaimer: \nBrian Dale Vander Werf MD Inc. has made every effort to ensure the accuracy of the information included in this product.

You will be asked a series of questions that will lead you to the most probable diagnosis.  This app also contains over 80 photos and charts to help you in your diagnosis. No internet connection needed to view the full app. It is all ready for super quick image and information retrieval. \n\nThere are also 50 interactive cases to solve. Each case starts with a clinical and dermoscopic image and ends with a labelled dermoscopic image pointing out critical structures.\n\nThis app is based on the 2 step algorithm with the first step involving the determination of whether the lesion is a melanocytic. Melanocytic lesions will be divided into nevi or lesions with varying levels of suspicion for melanoma based on melanoma specific patterns and common nevi patterns. Non-melanocytic lesions will be analyzed to determine if they are suspicious for basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Common benign lesions such as dermatofibroma, seborrheic keratoses and hemangiomas will be positively identified to avoid unnecessary biopsies. This app will increase your ability to detect skin cancers with greater accuracy thereby decreasing unnecessary biopsies and missing less early melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers.\n\nCheck out https://usatinemedia.com to learn more and watch a video demo of this app narrated by Dr. Richard P.

The final diagnosis rests on properly assimilating the information gained from the patient history, thorough naked eye physical examination, and meticulous dermoscopic inspection of the lesion.\n\n\n3Gen, Inc. is the sponsor of this app.  Visit www.dermlite.com to see their complete line of skin imaging devices.\n\nDeveloped by Usatine Media \nRichard P.

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

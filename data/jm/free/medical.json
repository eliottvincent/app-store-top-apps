Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

As seen in Apple’s “Parenthood” commercial, Parents Magazine, USA Today, Good Morning America, The New York Times, CBS This Morning, and more!\n\nKNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT\nOur care recommendations give you peace of mind with age-specific fever and symptom guidance - so you can know when it’s important to take extra precaution or see a doctor.\n\nREMEMBERS FOR YOU\nEasily track temperatures, symptoms and medication for everyone in your family! Remember details such as when symptoms began, how high the fever got, or when to give another dose of medication and share it with another caregiver or your doctor. Temperature data integrates seamlessly with HealthKit and the Health app.\n\nWHAT PARENTS ARE SAYING\n“The app tracks and organizes our family’s temps and symptoms and keeps the history. This is a wonderful app for a busy and sleep deprived mom!” \n“Hands down my favorite feature is that the app gives you suggestions on how to keep your little one comfortable and gives practical advice for a speedy recovery!”\n“The Kinsa app keeps all my data in one place and makes doctors appointments a breeze…”\n“We are a family of 6! Kinsa helps us keep track of everyone’s medical situation!”\n“This has to be one of the best products on the market for families, especially families with little ones!” \n\nThe free Kinsa app works best with Kinsa's award-winning, pediatrician-recommended QuickCare, QuickScan, and Smart Ear thermometers, available for purchase online and in retail stores across the U.S. If you have an older Smart Stick thermometer that plugs into the headphone jack of your phone, please use the Kinsa Smart Stick app instead. \n\nWe hope your family doesn't get sick, but if they do, we'll be there to help your family feel better faster!\n\nAll information, images, and other content shared through Kinsa’s mobile or web applications is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment from an appropriately qualified and licensed physician or other healthcare provider.

This is because in the daily hustle and bustle, things are simply forgotten, but the consequences can be dire…We bet you've definitely experienced this situation at least once in your life. \nMany people are used to using their alarm clock as a pill reminder - it rings at a certain time and you know exactly what time it is to take your pills. But it's a bygone era. Would you go to work or on a date with an alarm clock? Of course not! Or, for example, stickers or a notebook that you can always forget at home and miss your medication. It is much better and easier to keep a pill tracker in your smartphone. \nTaking medication is a big responsibility that affects how we feel and our health in general. And even classic reminders cannot perform their function to the best of their ability, the medication reminder is the best way to go about it.  \nTiming is important when taking many medications, especially antibiotics, contraceptives, hormones and antivirals. Taking care of your health is an important part of your lifestyle, and the med tracker is a great addition to this.\nIn this medication alarm app you have many functions - you can enter your treatment course, create a personalized schedule, set reminders to take various medications and even monitor your body parameters (weight, height, temperature and so on). \nIt's a real diary where you can keep track of your activities and changes! \nUsing a medication tracker can not only improve your health status, it can also have a positive impact on the dynamics of the healthcare system. Such pill reminder and med tracker apps teach you how to be responsible, and this is a key step towards recovery!\nThe medicine reminder can be used as an indispensable aid in the treatment of chronic diseases, especially hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and many others. For example, a person with diabetes will be able to keep track of his/her weight, keep his/her records directly in the medicine tracker and never forget to take pills!\nA pill reminder alarm will alert you if you have missed your medication, and will remind you to stick to your medication schedule. Easy to set up and use - the interface is so user-friendly. \nOur team's main aim is for all people to be healthy, which is why we created this app. We do not share your data with third parties, all information is strictly confidential.

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

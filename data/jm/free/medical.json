      "label": "The Teaching Resource Centre (TRC) Pharmacology is meant for medical students, but also very useful for any health care professional.\n\nThe TRC provides basic pharmacological knowledge: pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and drug mechanisms in context of (patho)physiology.\n\nEach topic includes graphic(s) in the TRC icon language, explanatory texts and questions with feedback. The TRC covers most relevant drugs prescribed in Europe. Each drug topic has references to the Dutch national formulary (Farmacotherapeutisch Kompas) or the British National Formulary.\n\nThe TRC can be used as a reference or as self-study tool during courses throughout the medical curriculum. The TRC helps students to obtain pharmacological knowledge providing a consistent, user friendly, recognizable, and structured presentation in order to optimize learning efficiency.\n\nWe strive to make this application the best resource for mechanisms of drug action in the context of physiology and pathophysiology by creating each topic in cooperation with an expert from the field. Graphics, texts, questions, and other reference data are provided to enhance the understanding of the user.\n\nThe App is kept up to date with the newest drugs and thus updated regularly."

It feels as if you'd hold a real ultrasound probe in your hand.\n\n-airScan gives you a feeling as if your patient was laying just below your iPhone: By using haptic feedback and sophisticated technical engineering the image you see on the screen is very similar to a real ultrasound examination. Slightly move your iPhone downwards and you'll apply more 'pressure' therefore the image quality improves. Move your iPhone upwards and the 'pressure' decreases - you will only see a partial image - until the applied 'pressure' becomes so little that no image can be seen anymore.\n\n-haptic feedback: With haptic feedback moving through the air now feels like moving a real probe on the skin of a patient. You can even feel when you lose contact or gain it again!\n\n-iOS 13 DarkMode support\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

The resources that do exist are often scattered, out of date, and inconvenient. We wanted a study tool that was comprehensive, current, and most of all, convenient! So we created Pimped! \n\nAt the surface, Pimped is a flashcard-based medical study app. Dig deeper, and you’ll discover that it is purpose-built to help medical students shine during clinical pimping, making one of medical education’s most stressful and controversial practices child’s play."

The users can adjust the parameter value by rich gesture adjustment operation. Compared with the traditional Doppler ultrasound, the handheld Doppler ultrasound has the advantages of small volume and low power consumption, and being free from the limitations of various application environments. We believe that the PR363 handheld Doppler diagnostic apparatus is about to open a new wave of ultrasound diagnostics."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

A few slide and tap action is enough for logging data.\n\nBlood Pressure Categories:\n\nWhat is blood pressure?\nAccording the National Institute Of Aging, Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries as the heart pumps blood. When a health care professional measures your blood pressure, they use a blood pressure cuff around your arm that gradually tightens. The results are given in two numbers. The first number, called systolic blood pressure, is the pressure caused by your heart contracting and pushing out blood. The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, is the pressure when your heart relaxes and fills with blood.\n\nThe blood pressure categories definition is from \n2018 ESC/ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension: The Task Force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH)  from \nhttps://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/33/3021/5079119\n\nand 2017 Guideline for High Blood Pressure in Adults by American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association\nfrom \nhttps://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2017/11/09/11/41/2017-guideline-for-high-blood-pressure-in-adults"

There is never enough time in the NICU for medical teams to communicate all the complex variables they are analyzing to take care of your baby. This app is a partner to parents and medical care teams. PreeMe+You utilizes a proprietary color system created and validated by doctors to track and communicate levels of NICU care and progress in five body system areas (breathing, eating, sleeping, temperature, and growth). This harmonizes communication between parents and rotating medical teams, preventing “lost in translation” and empowering parents with hands-on knowledge in real-time. It’s all the big and little things your medical team wants you to know about your baby’s personalized care if they had all the time in the world. \n\nUse the PreeMe + You App to help: \n\n- Track your baby’s whole body system progress and maturation in real-time.\n- Connect with how your medical team is caring for your baby.\n- Be fluent in NICU care and language. \n- Feel confident and comfortable communicating with your medical team. \n- Feel supported and build positive routines and rituals to care for your baby and yourself.      \n- Feel prepared to take your baby home. \n\nResearchers at the University of Chicago are finding that NICU parents using the PreeMe+You app feel more connected and at ease in the NICU, helping them with worry and emotional stress. These successes have been presented at the following peer-reviewed conferences: Pediatric Academic Societies, Society for Pediatric Research, and Break the Cycle Health Disparity And Equity Conference for Children."

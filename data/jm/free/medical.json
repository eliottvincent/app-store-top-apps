      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "ONLY DOCTORS WITH QARDIOMD ACCESS OR PATIENTS WHO ARE BEING MONITORED ARE ABLE TO LOGIN AND USE THE QARDIODIRECT APP.\n\nQardioDirect is the companion app for doctors with access to the QardioMD portal, and for patients those doctors are monitoring remotely.\n\nWith the QardioDirect app and Qardio devices, patients can reliably share medically accurate data such as:\n\n• ECG\n• Blood pressure\n• Heart rate\n• Irregular heartbeat detection\n• Blood oxygen level\n• Temperature\n• Weight, BMI, full body composition\n\nQardioMD is a powerful dashboard that lets doctors get just the right amount of data generated by their patients in an easy to view and understandable format.\nQardioMD continuously displays data in an actionable way, saving the doctor time and revenue while allowing them to provide better care. This HIPAA compliant solution allows clinicians to remotely monitor an unlimited number of patients and see who most needs their attention and who is doing well, all with a click of button. \n\nQardioDirect App:\n\n• Gives healthcare professionals an additional way to onboard new patients easily\n• Works with Qardio devices for in-clinic and at-home measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, ECG, heart rate, irregular heartbeat detection, blood oxygen level, temperature, weight, BMI and full body composition\n• Lets doctors demonstrate Qardio products to patients\n\nHow it works:\n\nPatients use FDA-cleared Qardio devices to monitor their health outside the doctor's office, which automatically share vitals with their provider.\n\nProviders use HIPAA-compliant QardioMD services. When a patient takes a measurement, the data is displayed in the secure QardioMD web portal.\n\nQardio does the rest. QardioMD continuously displays patient data, and with easy to use filters shows who needs priority attention.\n\nQardioDirect and Apple Health work seamlessly together, enabling easier health tracking with all your health and wellness information in one place. \n\nWhat other doctors have to say about Qardio:\n\n“I believe that good, high quality home blood pressure monitoring devices are going to be critical for achieving better blood pressure control in the US population. I’ve been very impressed with the QardioArm device, which we are currently using in the Health eHeart Study.” - Mark Pletcher, Health eHeart Study Principal Investigator, UCSF\n\n“As a physician, I believe people need to take control of their health and outcomes and this product being so easy to use, portable and most importantly accurate is a product I would recommend to all. Since stopping my denial and becoming a patient myself, I have done just that. Folks, the newest data regarding BP is irrefutable and having just one reading at a doctor’s office every so often is, in my opinion, the wrong way to detect hypertension and products like these should become part of a person's routine, especially as we age and our vessels become less compliant.” HB, Physician and QardioArm User, Amazon Review.\n\nQardioArm and QardioCore have regulatory clearance in the United States, European Economic Area, Canada. Qardio’s products and application should be only used in conjunction with professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and not as a substitute, or a replacement for it."

This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

The app calculates the pregnancy due date for women who have undergone fertility treatment including embryo transfer, IUI and egg retrieval. Due date information may also be calculated using the date of ovulation. \n\nHow to Use the Due Date Calculator app:\n\nView the options in the dropdown menu under “Calculate Pregnancy By” header and make your selection. Next, using the “Select Date” menu, enter the appropriate date and press calculate. Results will indicate the date of the last menstrual period (LMP), estimated due date, gestational age of the baby and likely date of conception. \n\nThe Due Date Calculator app is appropriate for use in women with a history of infertility as well as those who conceived naturally. For the best results, use the most accurate data available. \n\nIf a baby was conceived by natural conception, the estimated due date is determined by the first day of the mother’s last normal menstrual period. If an ovulation kit was used to detect LH surge, the ovulation date should be used to determine the expected due date. Due dates can also be calculated using the embryo transfer date or date of insemination.\n\nPregnancy due dates are not precise, but rather an estimation of the day a woman might be expected to give birth. Most women deliver within a two week period before or after their anticipated due date.\n\nFor use with IVF, IUI, HCG Trigger, LH Surge, Embryo Transfer."

      "label": "• THE FIRST AND ONLY LANGUAGE THERAPY APPLICATION SUPPORTED BY CLINICAL DATA:\nIn a 3-year clinical trial of 6,454 children with autism, language score in children who engaged with MITA has increased to levels, which were 120% higher than in children with similar initial evaluations. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.0001). See results at ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04108290. \n\n• Received FDA breakthrough device designation (Q210093)\n\n• Based on US patent 20160210870\n\n• Includes unlimited language and cognitive exercises designed to last for 10 years\n\n• Used by over 1.5 million children with language delay\n\n• Best Autism App on Healthline list\n\n• Available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Arabic, Farsi, Korean, Chinese.\n\nMental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children with language delay and autism. MITA trains mental integration and language, starting with simple vocabulary, and progressing towards higher forms of language, such as adjectives, verbs, pronouns, and syntax.\n\n\nMITA EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES\n\n• Based on ABA techniques of visual-visual and auditory-visual conditional discrimination.\n• Based on language therapy technique of following directions with increasing complexity.\n• Based on Pivotal Response Treatment. \n• Each activity is adaptive and delivers exercises that are at the exact level of difficulty appropriate for your child at any given point in time\n• Identify colors, patterns and sizes\n• Integrate objects into a unified picture\n• Spatial Prepositions: on/under/behind/in front\n• Time prepositions: Before/After\n• Passive verb tense\n• Subject / Object\n• Reading and Writing\n• Numbers and counting\n• Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division\n• Logic and reasoning\n• Mental perspective taking\n• Mental mathematics\n• Critical thinking \n• Self-control\n• Attention\n• Working Memory\n• Creativity\n• Playtime rewards will keep your child engaged while learning and having fun\n• No Wi-Fi necessary\n\nMITA develops your child’s imagination and language functions. The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing your child's ability to notice multiple features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that teach your child to attend to only one feature, such as size or color. Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require your child to attend to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size. MITA then moves on to puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape, and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of characteristics. \nThe verbal exercises use higher forms of language, such as adjectives, prepositions, and syntax.\n\nMITA is developed by Dr. A. Vyshedskiy, a neuroscientist from Boston University; R. Dunn, a Harvard-educated early-child-development specialist; MIT-educated, J. Elgart and a group of award-winning artists and developers working alongside experienced therapists.\n\nMost MITA features are completely free and the free MITA version provides access to years of language therapy. Some additional features are available as a MITA Premium subscription for $69.99/year. Your subscription pays for the development of new language exercises that are added each month. \n\n• Tuition will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Tuition automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• You can turn off auto-renewal by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that plan.\n\nTerms of use: http://imagiration.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy Policy: http://imagiration.com/privacy-policy/\nMITA in the news: https://youtu.be/giZymh3rMHc\nMITA research articles: http://imagiration.com/research/"

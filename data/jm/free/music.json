      "label": "If you're a songwriter, you probably recognize that melody is usually at least just as important as the lyrics they belong to. If you're a human, you've probably experienced what we like to call \"forgetting.\" Lyrics can be forgotten as easily as they're thought of, which is why most of us (Lil Wayne excluded) choose to write them down. Melody, however, can easily be forgotten as well. To combat this, many songwriters end up going back and forth between a notes app and a voice recorder app while writing in order to preserve both their lyrics and the corresponding melodies. With The Lyrics App, there's no need to switch back and forth between apps while you're writing. You can finally write your lyrics and record your melodies in the same place.\n\niCloud Backup: All of your songs, lyrics, and melodies will now be safely backed up to your iCloud (as long as you have storage available, of course). If you lose your phone or have to redownload The Lyrics App for any reason, rest assured that all of the songs you've written will still be available and will automatically be synced to your device after you open the app while you are logged in to your iCloud account on your device. This feature will also keep The Lyrics App synchronized across all of your devices that are logged in to the same iCloud account. \n\nRhyme Generator: Unlock the Rhyme Generator to gain instant access to thousands of rhyming words and phrases at your finger tips. To use the generator, simply highlight the word you'd like to see rhymes for (which you can do quickly by double tapping the word), then tap the Rhymes button that appears just above your keyboard. A list of up to 1,000 rhyming words and phrases will then be displayed on a scrollable bar on top of your device's keyboard. Tap one of the rhyme options to replace your highlighted word with the selected option.\n\nThesaurus: Unlock the Thesaurus to gain instant access to thousands of synonyms for your lyrics. To use the Thesaurus, highlight the word you'd like to see synonyms for (which you can do quickly by double tapping a word), then tap the Thesaurus button that appears just above your keyboard. A list of up to 1,000 synonyms will then be displayed on a scrollable bar on top of your device's keyboard. Tap one of the options to replace your highlighted text with the selected option."

Fan Noise Generator will simulate the sound of your existing box fan or oscillating fan by allowing users to change the fan motor speed, oscillation, and volume. The simple and modern interface remembers all settings for quick fan noise generation.\n\nThe Fan Noise Generator app is based on our most popular box fan sound, but adds speed and oscillation controls to make the sound completely unique. The Fan Noise Generator app is great for travel as you won’t need to bring a bulky fan with you, but it’s also perfect for home-use as it sounds completely realistic. The Fan Noise Generator running on a mobile device doesn’t consume as much power as using a mechanical fan so you'll save money on your electricity bill.  Download the Fan Noise Generator and get to sleep fast!\n\nPlease visit https://boxfansound.com/ for more information about our Fan Noise Generator app.\n\nCreated by TMSOFT\nhttps://www.tmsoft.com"

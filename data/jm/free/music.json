      "label": "Humanity is out of tune.\n“If one should desire to know whether a kingdom is well governed, if its morals are good or bad, the quality of its music will furnish the answer.” ~ Confucius.\n\nThe mass media is tuned to the concert pitch of A=440hz. The majority of mainstream music is in this pitch. Today's research shows that the 440 pitch might be a bit off and disharmonious with our bodies and minds. If you’re a Musician or an Audiophile or just love listening to your music this will be a tipping point for you. There is a movement in the Music World which is trying to bring the 432hz pitch into our lives. The A=432hz tuning is also known as “The Mathematical Tuning”, “The Natural Tuning”, ”The Pythagorean Tuning”. According to studies 432 resembles a code underlying our very universe in all aspects – light, time, gravity, magnetism, DNA, sacred geometry and the list goes on. 432 number, and its divisions, extends throughout all ancient history. Why is this important? Because sound (vibration) influences the mind and body immediately. Even the slightest constant dissonance can bring one to confusion, inner chaos and staying blind to what is going on around. Think about it, when something irritates you, the only thing you can deal with is making that thing stop. But you will never address bigger problems. It is well known today that the molecular structure of water is affected by vibration, thoughts, words, ideas and of-course Music. Our human body is made of approximately 70% water. So the link is pretty immediate here.\nI’m inviting you all to listen to your beloved music through this player which you might enjoy the brighter feeling it brings, but also will conceal healing qualities for the body and mind.\nLove Light & Meditation,\n\nP.S – I strongly recommend doing your own research on this most important matter. Please don’t rely solely upon my opinion and research.\n\n“Concerning matter, we have been all wrong. What we have called matter is energy, whose vibration has been so lowered as to be perceptible to the senses. There is no matter.”\n― Albert Einstein\n\nThe app is free and for those who want to hear their music in a more refined and healthy tone opposed to the 440 Hz.\n\n**The App Won't Play Apple Music Files.\n** The app will pitch shift music that's tuned to A = 440 Hz, it will not work on music tuned to other A note references.\n\nEnjoy\n\n*****If you do not have songs on your device the app will not have anything to play.*****\n\n** If something is not working please send an email to contact@appums.com and we'll try to find a solution.\nThanks\n\nPhoto Credits:\n* 432hz Cymaglyph by CymaScope."

Record yourself performing and attach it to any part of your lyrics. This is a powerful tool which allows users to keep track of their melody and never gets confused which recording goes with which verse.\n\nRhyme matching\nLyric automatically checks your lyrics for rhymes. Whenever you finish typing, rhyming words with automatically be color-coded. You also have options like increasing rhyme sensitivity to include near rhymes and only matching words at the end of the line.\n\nSyllable Counter\nThe syllable counter keeps track of the syllables in each line of your lyric. The syllable count is displayed to the left side of the screen. In measure mode, you also have a syllable counter for each quarter measure so that you can try to break your lyrics up evenly or create a unique syllable pattern.\n\nMeasure Mode\nMeasure mode allows you to break your lyric into quarter measures. This is helpful for lyric recitation. This mode also syncs with the metronome. The metronome will move along the quarter measures at your specified BPM (beats per minute) helping you to keep track when practicing your lyrics.\n\nWord Lookup\nLyric also allows you to look up new words. Find rhymes and near rhymes for words you have already used or search for a synonym or definition for a word that just isn't quite right. After searching for a word your results are presented in a movable tab. This way you can work on your lyrics and see your search results simultaneously.\n\nMetronome\nThe metronome allows you to specify the BPMs and syncs with both the background of the application and the quarter measures (if in measure mode). This allows you to use the metronome either as an audio or visual reference. \n\nNotes\nLyric also has a built-in notepad, which appears on the screen as a movable tab. This allows you to keep track of anything related to your lyrics without having to clutter your lyric itself. This helps keep the experience nice and clean."

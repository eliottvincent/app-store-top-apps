The game where you play the mix, listen to the freshest tunes, and step into the shoes of a world-class DJ! \n\nWith Tap & Mix You'll be tapping to the beat and playing along to awesome tracks instantly, because it's just as easy to play, as it is to get down to your favorite songs! Get started by selecting 'gameplay mode,' and you'll land in a jam-packed songbook. Here, you'll discover a range of incredible songs from a massive variety of genres and styles for you to master playing. You'll be able to play everything from punchy techno beats and vibrant house hooks through to huge EDM drops and Dubstep breaks. \n\nOnce you've chosen your first track, it's time to get behind the decks and start tapping to the beat. Playing Tap & Mix is both exhilarating and straightforward! All you have to do is take hold of your decks and follow a dynamic cue system that will guide you through the mix. Each cue lets you know the moment you need to tap and how long you need to tap for to play along correctly. How well you play defines how much XP you earn, and the more accurately you tap to the beat, the more XP you'll receive! XP is used for purchasing new tracks and features, so you want to follow the cues and tap consecutively to create lines and get bonus combo XP! As you progress, you'll unlock new songs that will put your rhythm and mixing skills to the test as the challenge ramps up! \n\nTap & Mix also allows you to create and perform original mixes in 'Free Mix' mode. Free Mix takes you to a set of virtual decks, where you can add songs and start mixing independently straight away! You'll have access to a range of professional DJing tools that will allow you to manipulate your tracks as you practice and perform amazing mixes. As you explore your condensed CDJ setup, you’ll be able to sync BPM, manipulate tracks with professional studio FX, and experiment with EQ and faders. Further to this, you'll be able to scratch the decks as you perform your tracks live! Free Mix is for users of all levels as it’s designed for ease of use, allowing you to practice authentic Djing in an entirely accessible format.\n\nTap & Mix is a DJ game that doesn't drop a beat! Step up to the decks and start tapping to the beat and mixing your tracks now. It's time for Tap & Mix.\n\nThe app contains the following subscription options:\n- Weekly with a 3-day free trial at $7.99*.\n- Yearly at $39.99.\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\n- The account is charged for renewal within 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user’s Account Settings after purchase.\n- The cost of renewal is equal to the value that “Apple’s App Store Matrix” determines as the equivalent of the subscription price in $USD.\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://gismart.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Service: https://gismart.com/terms-of-service"

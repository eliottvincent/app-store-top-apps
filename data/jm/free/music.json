SEARCH, FINALLY WORKING FOR CLASSICAL!\nSearch for recordings, not for albums or tracks: look for composers, works, performers or any combination of those.\n\n. COMPOSERS, WORKS AND MUCH MORE\nBrowse 200+ composers and tens of thousands of works, conveniently organized: A to Z, popular, essential, by genre, by period. Set favorite composers and works and browse directly to them.\n\n. CREDITS GO ALL TO THE ARTISTS\nNo more guessing games: each recording presents full credits of its performers: orchestras, conductors, soloists, singers, chamber groups...\n\n. NO-NONSENSE RADIO STATIONS\nThe typical classical music online radio is pure chaos: the \"sacrificial dance\" from \"The Rite of Spring\", one prelude from \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\", then a slow movement from some Mozart piano concerto... stop this erratic movement swapping and embrace a classical radio that makes sense.\n\n. 1, 2, 3, EASY AS A-B-C\nAlbums and tracks are convenient for popular music but not suitable at all for classical music and its large, fragmented works. Say hi to a classical music player designed for multi-movement sets, that presents both a detailed view of each movement and a global progress bar of the work as a whole.\n\n. PLAYLISTS GALORE!\nOrganize recordings by setting them favorites or by creating playlists, which can be played randomically as a radio station.\n\n* An active Apple Music subscription is needed for full music playback."

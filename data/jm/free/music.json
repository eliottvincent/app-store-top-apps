If it is incorrect, it can be edited/corrected from Songle.\n- Video contributors can fix the correct chorus position in Songle (you need to login to Songle with your Nico Nico account)\n- The idea of \"playback chorus one after another\" is inspired by Songrium's \"Super History Player (http://doc.songrium.jp/chorekishi/)\" and \"Smart Player (https://smart.songrium.jp/)\" functions.\n \n2: About CoverMIX\n- This is made possible by AIST's derivative work recommendation technology based on information on derivative works provided by Songrium (https://songrium.jp/), a music listening support service developed and released by AIST.\n- The idea of \"playback so that it sounds like a single song\" was inspired by Songrium's \"relay playback\" function.\n\n3: Automatic playback recommendations\n- AIST's music recommendation technology analyzes the acoustic signals of music content and plays content suitable for continuous playback, taking into account the similarity of musical tones and other factors.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"

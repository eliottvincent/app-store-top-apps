      "label": "We believe that everyone can make music, even if you haven't had any experience.\n\nMusic Maker Go (MMG) is a tool to help you make quick music clips anytime and anywhere. It is easy to use even if you have never experienced any professional DAW. Best for inspiration records or making beats while hanging out with your friends. You could also learn how to make good music by looking into the templates already embedded in the app.\n\n-- Packs of music samples to get you quick start\nIf you don't know how a music is made, don't worry. Each time you create a new music clip, you can start from choosing a premade music pack, which may consist of two or more tracks. You can listen to the previews and then go to the edit mode, where you can see how many tracks needed for this music clip and how each note was composed in each track. We prepared a bunch of free music packs for new beginners. For premium users, you can try our monthly or yearly plan to access all musicpacks, all templates, and all sounds without any ADs.\n\n-- Hundreds of templates help you quick fill music notes\nYou can manually fill each music note in your own will, or you can choose a template from the idea panel, and do your own imagination based on that. Hundreds of templates provided in the app can let you make a short music even in just a few minutes (literally). What's more, most of these templates are completely free to use.\n\n-- Easy switch of different sounds for same notes\nIt's so fun to hear each different version of a popular song. In our app you can easily achieve that by a simply switch of sound pack. Piano could be classic, but how about play with Electric-guitar or even synthesizer. Use your imagination.\n\n-- Good supports for either new or old hands\nEveryone can make music, including those who have never tried to make one. You don't need to know a bulk of musician knowledge before you start. Each part in this app is designed to be easily recognizable and understandable. Just spend a few minutes and you will get how to master the whole process.\n\n-- Music genres we support for now (still growing)\nRemix\nTrap / Beats (with 808 drum preset but you can manually choose other EDM drum sets)\nDubstep EDM\nHouse EDM\nTrance EDM\n\nTo be specific, we support those features while composing music:\n1) full range of keyboard, up to C7, down to C-2\n2) manually swipe to any place on the track, and then type or delete any music notes\n3) you can also keep the track playing and type notes on the go\n4) all notes are automatically aligned\n5) tracks are divided into five different categories (Drum / Lead / Chords / Bass / FX) with preset best-fit keyboards\n6) Easily change sound effect for your keyboard with more than 100 sounds embedded\n7) To make your keyboard clean and clear, we prepared 12 different keyboard layouts arranged by different scales which you can easily switch from one to another by one click.\n8) and etc. (too much to write down them all, waiting for you to explore)\n\nWe're a small team but take music as life. We'd love to know ideas or complaints you met while using our app. Our aim is that everyone can make short music easily, without having to learn music theories for many years. Life should be simple and full of music.\n\nIf you would like to talk with us, please don't hesitate to send us an email: easymusicmaker@gmail.com, looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nhttps://easymusic.app/\nhttps://easymusic.app/privacy.html"

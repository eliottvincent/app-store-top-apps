The easiest way to get started with real music production.\n\n*** Apple Design Award ***\n*** Best of App Store ***\n*** Editor’s Choice ***\n\nWHY PEOPLE LOVE AUXY\n“Auxy is my favorite way to get what is going on in my brain into a musical format. It is simple on the surface but with tremendous depth if you need it.” - RAC\n\n“The automation is terrific. I am doing things with Auxy I would not easily do in my studio. The design is insanely smart and forward-thinking.” - Madeon\n\n“It is wild bro, you gotta get this!” - Majid Jordan\n\nCREATE AND MIX LOOPS\nBuild melodies and drum loops by drawing notes. Arrange your loops with scenes to explore ideas or make full-length tracks.\n\nDISCOVER GREAT SOUNDS\nBrowse thousands of high quality synth patches, sampled instruments and one-shot samples. You can import samples to the drum machine and build your own melodic instruments.\n\nADD EFFECTS AND AUTOMATION\nAdd studio-grade effects like reverb, delay, distortion and chorus. Fine-tune sounds to find the perfect mix. Create modulation and transitions with powerful automation.\n\nSHARE AND COLLABORATE\nUpload your tracks to SoundCloud or export them as audio or video files. Quickly share links to your projects if you want to collaborate with other producers.\n\nEXPORT TO YOUR FAVORITE DAW\nYou can export projects to Ableton Live, Bitwig Studio or Studio One, which makes Auxy a great sketchpad for producers on the go. You can also bounce projects as separate audio and MIDI files, which can be imported into any popular music-making app.\n\nJAM WITH FRIENDS\nAuxy supports Ableton Link, which lets you jam in sync with other apps and devices connected to the same Wi-Fi.\n\nTRY IT FREE\nAuxy is free to download and evaluate with a limited set of sounds. You also get a 7-day free trial to evaluate all the sounds and features before you start a subscription.\n\nMADE IN SWEDEN\nAuxy is built by a small and independent team in Sweden. Our mission is to put a studio in everyone's pocket and push music forward as an artform.\n\nTHANK YOU AUSTIN HAGA\nThe music in the preview video is made by Austin Haga.

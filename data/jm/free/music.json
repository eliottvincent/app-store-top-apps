It also supports the Midas versions of these mixers (M32* and M-Air)\n\nIt features stereo channels to save screen real-estate, namable groups and automatic console discovery. Musicians can control the send levels into their monitoring mix bus for all channels aux tracks and effects returns. \n\nIt makes the sound check painless and allows you to adjust the mix during the gig. \n\nSome key differentiating Features:\n • Linked channels are treated as a stereo channel to save screen space. \n • Double tapping a fader knob sets it 0.\n • Double tapping the panning control on a stereo channel pans the signal hard L/R. Another double tap reverses the panning.\n\nAnd as always: The app is built with data privacy in mind - no adds, no tracking!\n\nThe PRO pack unlocks even more features like:\n • Decayed meters with peak memory\n • Compression meters\n • Gate LEDs\n • Channel mute buttons (X32)\n • Group mute buttons (X32)\n • Unlimited groups\n • Scenes\n • Bus EQ"

      "label": "StarPlayrX for iOS is a simple and easy-to-use streaming satellite radio app.\n\nIt requires a streaming satellite radio account or trial.\n\nStarPlayrX is accessible and one of its features is the magic tap that toggles a stream. Sighted users can also double at the player view to pause.\n\nThe player currently supports music, talk and sports radio stations that matches the user's subscription. It currently does not include Xtra radio stations.\n\nStarPlayrX organizes channels within categories. SPX groups these categories by type. All the talk channels are located together under the Talk heading. Also, the All category is located under Other header towards the bottom.\n\nEach category groups channels logically. For instance all the rock channels are located together with the Rock category and specific artist channels are in the Artists category. Categories and their channels are subject to change at any time.\n\nThe user interface for StarPlayrX is simple, clean, well organized and most of all easy to use. The goal of StarPlayrX is to enhance your SiriusXM satellite radio streaming experience.\n\nStarPlayrX runs in the foreground or background and uses very few resources to run. Artist and song info is available on the lock screen. If StarPlayrX is interrupted for a phone call, it will do its best to restart the stream after the phone call is over. SPX also mixes well with Apple Maps audio."

In a tight space? You \n    control the atmosphere with our custom EQ settings. \n\n+ Remote On/Off: you’d never walk all the way to your TV to turn it on and \n   you shouldn’t have to with your wireless speaker either. Use the app to \n   turn your speaker on/off from afar.  \n\n+ Much more: personalize your speaker’s name, EQ preferences, and \n   preset playlists (BOOM 3, MEGABOOM 3 and HYPERBOOM only).\n\n+ Subscribe to updates so you never miss a thing. A simple tap in the app \n   updates your speaker with the latest features in no time."

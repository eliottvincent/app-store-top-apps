Voloco automatically detects the key of the beat to make sure you’re in tune, unlike other singing apps.\n\nIMPORT YOUR BEATS FOR FREE\nWith Voloco, using your beats is free.\n\nPROJECTS\nCreate complex arrangements with the ability to save and work on them later. Record with the peace of mind that you can refine your tracks in the future.\n\nMULTI-TRACK\nUse up to four vocal layers in the recording studio to record overdubs, ad-libs, harmonies, and more.\n\nPROCESS EXISTING AUDIO OR VIDEO\nApplying Voloco effects to audio you recorded elsewhere is easy in our audio editor. You can also apply Voloco effects like reverb or auto voice tune to the vocals of pre-recorded videos––use Voloco as a voice recorder and changer. This recording app and voice changer lets you import video of a celebrity interview and make them sound like a child or an angry alien. Be creative!\n\nEXTRACT VOCALS\nSeparate vocals from existing songs with vocal remover and create something incredible.Want to hear Elvis with pitch correction? Or make Frank Sinatra sound like a creepy demon? Import a song, separate the vocals with vocal remover, select an effect, and you have an instantly memorable remix. You can even separate and edit vocals from music videos or try using Voloco as a karaoke app by separating vocals with our vocal remover.\n\nEXPORT\nIf you want to finish your mix with another app, that's easy. You can rap or sing over a track, record yourself, and export just your vocals as AAC or WAV for final mixing in your favorite DAW.\n\nTOP TRACKS\nCheck out some of the professional-quality tracks users have made with Voloco in the Top Tracks section of the singing and recording app.\n\nLYRICS PAD\nJot down your lyrics so you have everything you need to make a top track right in the app or belt karaoke with your friends.\n\n50+ EFFECTS\nVoloco features over 50 effects grouped into 12 preset packs. Explore basics like reverb and auto voice tune or transform your voice in the voice recorder and changer.\n\nStarter: Two flavors of auto vocal tune, a rich harmony preset, a monster vocoder, and a clean preset for noise reduction only.\nLOL: Funny effects including vibrato, drunk tune, and vocal fry.\nSpooky: Aliens, demons, ghosts, and more.\nTalkbox: Classic and future electro-funk sounds.\nModern Rap I: Add stereo width, thickness, and heft to your vocals.\nModern Rap II: Extended harmonies and effects that are great for ad-libs.\nP-Tain: Extreme pitch correction plus seventh chords. Perfect for RnB and rap.\nBon Hiver: Lush harmony and auto voice tune in the style of Bon Iver's song \"Woods.\"\n8 Bit Chip: Bleeps and boops like your favorite games from the 80's\nDuft Pank: Funky vocoder sounds similar to a certain French electronic duo.\nSitar Hero: Inspired by Indian classical music.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://resonantcavity.com/privacy\nTerms and conditions: https://resonantcavity.com/appterms"

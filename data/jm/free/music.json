Voloco automatically detects the key of the beat to make sure you’re in tune, unlike other singing apps.\n\nIMPORT YOUR BEATS FOR FREE\nWith Voloco, using your beats is free.\n\nPROJECTS\nCreate complex arrangements with the ability to save and work on them later. Record with the peace of mind that you can refine your tracks in the future.\n\nMULTI-TRACK\nUse up to four vocal layers in the recording studio to record overdubs, ad-libs, harmonies, and more.\n\nPROCESS EXISTING AUDIO OR VIDEO\nApplying Voloco effects to audio you recorded elsewhere is easy in our audio editor. You can also apply Voloco effects like reverb or auto voice tune to the vocals of pre-recorded videos––use Voloco as a voice recorder and changer. This recording app and voice changer lets you import video of a celebrity interview and make them sound like a child or an angry alien. Be creative!\n\nEXTRACT VOCALS\nSeparate vocals from existing songs with vocal remover and create something incredible.Want to hear Elvis with pitch correction? Or make Frank Sinatra sound like a creepy demon? Import a song, separate the vocals with vocal remover, select an effect, and you have an instantly memorable remix. You can even separate and edit vocals from music videos or try using Voloco as a karaoke app by separating vocals with our vocal remover.\n\nEXPORT\nIf you want to finish your mix with another app, that's easy. You can rap or sing over a track, record yourself, and export just your vocals as AAC or WAV for final mixing in your favorite DAW.\n\nTOP TRACKS\nCheck out some of the professional-quality tracks users have made with Voloco in the Top Tracks section of the singing and recording app.\n\nLYRICS PAD\nJot down your lyrics so you have everything you need to make a top track right in the app or belt karaoke with your friends.\n\n50+ EFFECTS\nVoloco features over 50 effects grouped into 12 preset packs. Explore basics like reverb and auto voice tune or transform your voice in the voice recorder and changer.\n\nStarter: Two flavors of auto vocal tune, a rich harmony preset, a monster vocoder, and a clean preset for noise reduction only.\nLOL: Funny effects including vibrato, drunk tune, and vocal fry.\nSpooky: Aliens, demons, ghosts, and more.\nTalkbox: Classic and future electro-funk sounds.\nModern Rap I: Add stereo width, thickness, and heft to your vocals.\nModern Rap II: Extended harmonies and effects that are great for ad-libs.\nP-Tain: Extreme pitch correction plus seventh chords. Perfect for RnB and rap.\nBon Hiver: Lush harmony and auto voice tune in the style of Bon Iver's song \"Woods.\"\n8 Bit Chip: Bleeps and boops like your favorite games from the 80's\nDuft Pank: Funky vocoder sounds similar to a certain French electronic duo.\nSitar Hero: Inspired by Indian classical music.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://resonantcavity.com/privacy\nTerms and conditions: https://resonantcavity.com/appterms"

      "label": "Humanity is out of tune.\n“If one should desire to know whether a kingdom is well governed, if its morals are good or bad, the quality of its music will furnish the answer.” ~ Confucius.\n\nThe mass media is tuned to the concert pitch of A=440hz. The majority of mainstream music is in this pitch. Today's research shows that the 440 pitch might be a bit off and disharmonious with our bodies and minds. If you’re a Musician or an Audiophile or just love listening to your music this will be a tipping point for you. There is a movement in the Music World which is trying to bring the 432hz pitch into our lives. The A=432hz tuning is also known as “The Mathematical Tuning”, “The Natural Tuning”, ”The Pythagorean Tuning”. According to studies 432 resembles a code underlying our very universe in all aspects – light, time, gravity, magnetism, DNA, sacred geometry and the list goes on. 432 number, and its divisions, extends throughout all ancient history. Why is this important? Because sound (vibration) influences the mind and body immediately. Even the slightest constant dissonance can bring one to confusion, inner chaos and staying blind to what is going on around. Think about it, when something irritates you, the only thing you can deal with is making that thing stop. But you will never address bigger problems. It is well known today that the molecular structure of water is affected by vibration, thoughts, words, ideas and of-course Music. Our human body is made of approximately 70% water. So the link is pretty immediate here.\nI’m inviting you all to listen to your beloved music through this player which you might enjoy the brighter feeling it brings, but also will conceal healing qualities for the body and mind.\nLove Light & Meditation,\n\nP.S – I strongly recommend doing your own research on this most important matter. Please don’t rely solely upon my opinion and research.\n\n“Concerning matter, we have been all wrong. What we have called matter is energy, whose vibration has been so lowered as to be perceptible to the senses. There is no matter.”\n― Albert Einstein\n\nThe app is free and for those who want to hear their music in a more refined and healthy tone opposed to the 440 Hz.\n\n**The App Won't Play Apple Music Files.\n** The app will pitch shift music that's tuned to A = 440 Hz, it will not work on music tuned to other A note references.\n\nEnjoy\n\n*****If you do not have songs on your device the app will not have anything to play.*****\n\n** If something is not working please send an email to contact@appums.com and we'll try to find a solution.\nThanks\n\nPhoto Credits:\n* 432hz Cymaglyph by CymaScope."

      "label": "This music album is a waking call for humanity to reconcile itself. We are being fed the wrong ideas, the wrong nutrition, the limited science, no self-exploration, no self-experiencing. Self-interest is the highest value being promoted today. All this to sustain a legacy system that we are forced to inherit. The question remains… Do we want to continue this way of living and thinking?\n“What we are trying in all these discussions and talks here,\nIs to see if we cannot radically bring about a transformation of the mind. Not accept things as they are – but to understand it, to go into it, examine it, give your heart and your mind with everything that you have to find out. A way of living differently” ~ Jiddu Krishnamurti.\n“The reason we have poverty is that we have no imagination. There's no earthly reason; there's no physical, technical reason for there being any poverty at all anywhere. But you see, there are a great many people accumulating what they think is vast wealth, but it's only money. They don't know how to use it, they don't know how to enjoy it, because they have no imagination.” ~Alan Watts\nI practice meditation, Tai Chi (Temple Style which involves Qi Gong as well) and yoga. These songs have been written through deep sincere meditation and they express the thoughts & emotions that can’t be brought forward in words. The message is clear - open yourself to infinite possibilities and grow your environmental awareness.\nI recommend you find some sort of practice that involves mediation and wellbeing. It will clear your view of thoughts.\nLove Light & Meditation\nOphir\n“The difference between genius and stupidity is; genius has its limits… Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I’m not sure about the universe.”\n-Albert Einstein"

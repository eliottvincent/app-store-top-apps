This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

Readings with the filter on are more inert than those with the filter off though. THE FILTER MUST BE ON WHEN CYCLING, JOGGING OR WALKING.\n\n3. The G-meter. Get APPROXIMATE acceleration calculated based on your speed variation. Why use the GPS G-meter: no need to keep your iPhone in a fixed position or connect it to your vehicle’s computer system, which means speed readings can be taken discreetly, for example, during a test drive. Taking a number of readings compensates lesser accuracy. Acceleration is calculated only when the filter is off. Acceleration cannot be measured near tall buildings, in the mountains or woods.\n\n4.

Export track statistics table to a CSV file\n\n19. Load and show your route (journey plan) on the map together with a track. To do this, create a route, using a special online service (such as GPX Editor - https://www.gpxeditor.co.uk/map, The online GPX file editor - https://gpx.studio/, Track drawing websites - https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Track_drawing_websites) on your desktop, and export it as a GPX (KML, CSV) file. The file name must begin with \"Route\". Using iTunes, transfer the file into the app (OR use the \"Files\" app). Following this, you will be able to select your route at the bottom of your track list. Now you can easily travel following your route line, even without loading a map.\n\n20. Export and import files via iTunes and email\n\n21. Waypoints (description, color selection, keywords, photos, audio records)\n\n22. A single waypoint database with a filter option\n\n23. Music controls\n\n24. No annoying ads\n\n25. Vintage design \n\n\nAudio alert settings:\n• \"60! 70!! 80!!!\": One audio signal once you go over 60, a continuous signal for over 70, and another continuous (and more unpleasant) signal for over 80.\n• \"60! 70\": Detailed cues, such as \"60! 70!!\".\n• \"50!! 55. 60!!\": Continuous signal within the speed range between 50 and 55, and continuous signal for over 60.\n• \"60!!! 60.\": One signal above 60.\n• You can enter a comment at the beginning of the line, for example, \"Highway 70!!!\".\n• Type in any word without numbers (for example, \"OFF\") and use if to turn off the speed control.\n• You can upload your own WAV file with the name of the signal (for example, \"!.wav\" or \"!!!.wav\") to play your own sound. Connect your iPhone to a computer, then go to iTunes > iPhone > \"File Sharing\" > Apps. Or use the \"Files\" app.\n\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\n1. When driving past tall buildings (or in the mountains or woods) with the filter off, the device may display false speed spikes (due to an unstable satellite signal). In this case, switching the filter on may be a better option.\n\n2. Car speedometers often display a higher than actual speed, the difference sometimes reaching 10%. This is due to your wheels’ diameter. This is why at high speeds GPS speedometers can deliver better accuracy than your regular car speedometer. And the higher the speed, the more accurate your GPS speedometer is.\n\n3. Please note that temporary false readings are possible with ANY GPS speedometer when you start using it.\n\n4.

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service.

That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities. Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser.

You can then tap to view street view, share or get directions (via Apple Maps or iMaps+).\n\nAlternatively, drag the yellow peg man from the top left hand corner of the map and release over a road or path to access street view.\n\nStreet view supports zooming in and out, and showing a mini-map overlay. There is also a full screen mode for a more immersive experience.\n\nIf you need a more complete Google Maps experience, look for \"iMaps+ for Google Maps\" on the App Store. iMaps+ provides all the great functionality from iStreets with the addition of directions, traffic, contacts integration and more.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nSubscriptions: iStreets operates as a subscription service. Recurring purchase is required for full functionality. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed, and auto-renewal may be turned off, from iStreets settings or the Apple Settings app. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited if you change your subscription term.\n\nDirections, street view and live traffic details are only available in certain geographical regions.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nTerms of Service: http://apptility.co.uk/imaps_tos.html\n\nApptility Limited is not related to, or affiliated with, Google, Inc.

You can also find the elevation of your current location by using online database, built-in GPS, or barometer on your device.\n\r\n\r\n\nElevation data benefits flood prevention, prediction of water levels in rivers, lakes, and seas, etc. Thus, knowing the elevation of places is very crucial if you are looking for a flood-free house, or planning for a hiking trip, and more.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\n## Could-based Altitude Data ##\r\nThe easiest way to find altitude of any location on earth. By simply point on the screen, you can get the elevation data from a coordinate location point. “Range Mode” is available for altitude comparison (by graph and line) of each point between two selected locations. \n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## GPS Altitude Data ##\r\nUse built-in GPS on your device to determine the altitude of your current location. The altitude data of the area you walked-through will be recorded and displayed as a multicolored line on the map. The colors presented on the line indicate different heights. Precision indicators (horizontal resolution and vertical resolution) are displayed on the screen.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Barometric Altitude Data ##\r\nUse built-in barometer on your device to determine the elevation of your current location. You can either measure the elevation from raw barometric data, or relative pressure from sea-level. Like GPS data, the result is displayed as a multicolored line.\n\n\r\n\r\nTo get the most accurate data, it is recommended to adjust the sea level pressure and temperature prior to the measurement, and set the offset or calibration value if necessary. \n\r\n\r\n\n## Standalone Barometer ##\r\nYou can use this app as a standalone barometer.\n\r\n\r\n\n## Air Pressure / Altitude Calculator ##\r\nAtmospheric pressure and/or altitude at your current location are calculated from known altitude, pressure of the location, temperature and/or sea level pressure.\r\n\r\n\n## Support of Coordinate Formats ##\r\nThis app not only displays regular latitude and longitude data, but also supports many coordinate systems such as, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) and more.\r\n\r\n## Export of Data ##\r\nFrom this app, you can export many useful information including timestamp, altitude, pressure, and coordinates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSubscription\n-------------\nElevation - Sea Level Map  is completely free to use with all features. You can subscribe to this application to remove ads and reduce data retrieving delay by 50%.\n\nDevice subscriptions are available in these plan and will renew automatically each month, six months or year, unless cancelled.\n\n(Per month) - $4.49\n(Per six-months) - $25.99\n(Per year) - $48.99\n\nPricing shown is for the United States store. Pricing in other stores will vary.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n\nSubscriptions may be managed by going to your iTunes Account Settings after purchase or by clicking the “Purchase / Manage Subscription.

      "label": "With our app, measuring the area of spaces is even easier. \n\nOne measuring option is just to start the app and walk around a space to measure the area on foot. This is the easiest method to use if you simply need square footage. \nThe other measuring option involves a little more planning. Sit on your comfy sofa, start our app, and in the custom map view, manually select the points/area to measure. This can come in handy if you want to measure your plot of land, or a physical area for future investment. On the other hand, if you are a farmer and you want to know the area of your planting fields, it's a great option for you as well. After taking the measurements, you can share them with your coworkers or friends.\nThe app is extremely useful for a large number of specialists in various fields.\n\nRecommendations\nExternal Bluetooth GPS receiver is recommended if your built-in receiver is not accurate enough. We specifically recommend GARMIN GLO and GARMIN GLO 2 which gives the accuracy up to 0.3 m.  \n\nOur app can also come in handy when measuring distances, so if you are a runner, or you are planning a hiking trip, there’s nothing simpler than measuring the distances of your adventure with our app!\n\nOur measurement algorithms are very accurate. They use both GPS positioning and a network connection to make your measurements even more accurate. \n\nSome of the measurements include:\n- Field area measurement in meters², kilometers², feet², nmi², yards² and acres.\n- Distance measurement in meters, kilometers, nautical miles, feet & miles, yards\n- Elevation\n- Latitude and longitude in formats:\n- decimal degrees\n- degrees, decimal minutes\n- degrees, minutes, seconds\n- UTM\n\nApplication is useful for:\n- Land surveyors\n- City planners\n- Farmers\n- Landscape designers\n- Construction surveys\n- Facilities mapping\n- Construction sites and building sites area\n- Farm fencing\n\nImportant!: The accuracy of the application depends on the GPS sensor accuracy in a device - on most devices the accuracy is within +/- 5m. To improve accuracy, we encourage you to use more a precise GPS receiver, such as Garmin which provides accuracy to a few cm.\n\n\r\nPrivacy policy: https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/privacy/mygpsareacalculator\t\r\nTerms and conditions: https://mysticmobileapps.com/legal/terms/mygpsareacalculator"

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

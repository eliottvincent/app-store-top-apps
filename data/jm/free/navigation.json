Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

It supports HTML 5 + CSS 3, and is based in Webkit. \n\nCroPlus gives you the power to take back control of your Web experience. That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities. Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser.

      "label": "Moovit is one app for all your urban mobility and transit rides. \n\nTransportation is an integral part of urban living. Whether you ride the train, subway, bus, light rail, ferry or metro, use dockless scooters, bikes, ride-sharing like Uber or Lyft, getting the best urban mobility information is critical. Enter Moovit! Moovit provides riders with a one-stop-shop journey experience to help them get from point A to B in the easiest and most efficient way. Get train and bus times, maps, and real-time arrival information with ease so that you can plan your trip with confidence. Pay and validate your rides. Find critical alerts and service disruptions for your favorite lines. Get step-by-step directions of optimal route bus, train, metro, bike, scooter or a combination of them. \n\nMoovit guides more than 930 million users in over 3400 cities throughout the world. Commuters will find updated bus and train times, transit maps, and, where available, real-time line arrivals. Locate nearby bus stops and train stations, travel with on-the-go live navigation guidance, receive get-off alerts when approaching your destination to ensure a smooth ride. That's why Moovit has been named one of the best apps of the year in 2017 by the App Store.\n\nMoovit is your personal assistant for all your transit rides! \n\n► Real-time arrivals. View real-time arrival information, which is taken directly from GPS devices positioned on buses and trains. Avoid wasting time guessing train times or bus times.\n\n► Digital payment. Purchase bus & train tickets and validate your digital pass with a tap (select cities). \n\n► Real time alerts. Know about issues ahead of time by receiving service alerts such as emergency or unexpected disruptions, delays, traffic jams, new construction, and more so that you can plan ahead if your bus time or train time changed.\n\n► Live Directions. Get step-by-step bus directions and other transit directions with live guidance from A-to-B: Know how long you need to walk to your station, view your line's arrival time, receive get-off alerts as you approach your destination, and more. \n\n► Visualize Your Stop. Use augmented reality to locate your bus or train stop with \"Way Finder\".\n\n► User reports. Moovit’s users report issues found with stations, line service, and schedules so that we can inform all nearby riders about what’s going on in their area.\n\n► Favorite lines, stations, and places. Get easy access to lines, stations, and places you ride and visit all the time. Plus, get real-time updates if/when there are changes to your favorite lines in case your bus time or train time is impacted!\n\n► Bike routes. Get bike routes in addition to the bus, subway, train, or metro trip plans. If you ride bikes (yours or shared) we can plan a route that includes the train or bus. Moovit will help you plan a trip that meets your transit-needs. Bike docking stations are updated in real-time. Bike trip plans are only available in supported metro areas.\n\n► Maps view. Interested in seeing the whole picture? View all stations, routes, and lines on the subway or bus map. Additionally, maps are available in PDF for when you’re offline, or underground on the subway. \n\nMoovit is the #1 urban mobility app in the world. We’re proud to collaborate with public transit agencies across the United States, including:\nMTA\nNJ Transit\nMBTA\nSEPTA\nLA Metro\nSFMTA Muni\nBART\nCaltrain\nCTA\nMetra\nWMATA\nMTA Maryland\nTriMet\nSound Transit\nSARTA\nPARTA\n\nYou only need one app on your phone to navigate nearby buses and transit in the U.S. and across 112 other countries and in 45 languages.

      "label": "With GPS Tracker application you can transform your iOS mobile device to GPS tracker (GPS tracking device) and use all GPS-server.net features. In order to use this application, you must have personal account or hosted software.\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS Tracker running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. If you want better battery life, set tracking interval to at least 60-120 seconds.\n\nGPS Tracker features:\n- Track your device online in real time;\n- Record and review tracks, generate reports;\n- Configure various kinds of events and notifications;\n- Assign or schedule various tasks and delivery times;\n- Communicate with the person at the other end using built-in chat function;\n- Make photos and upload to user account with current location;\n- Possibility to change tracking interval;\n- Phone battery level is sent together with every location;\n- If Internet is lost, application will save locations and upload them later;\n- Possibility to control application via web browser using commands;\n- Password protection;\n- Application runs in background.\n\nGPS-server.net features:\n- Real time tracking mode represents live data of tracked objects. Information is updated every ten seconds without need to refresh page or relogin to account. Monitored data contains vehicle status, latitude, longitude, altitude, address, speed, connection time, ignition status, fuel consumption, sensor data, nearest geozone and much more.\n\n- Widgets display recent object information which is updated every ten seconds without need to refresh web page. Send commands to control device, view recent events and mileage graph.\n\n- Events is one of the most important feature which our software offers. Events are used to trigger actions by important or disruptive activities. Customer will get instant SMS/E-mail/Push notifications triggered by different event types.\n\n- History shows all stored data which server has collected from connected devices for chosen period of time. Software stores information received from GPS tracking devices, such as speed, time, location, stops, reports, events, etc. History is displayed in different ways: visually on the map, in a graph or HTML/XLS format.\n\n- POI (Points of Interest) allow you to put markers at the locations that might be interesting or useful. You can also name the place, add short description, attach an image or even video to it.\n\n- Routes feature is a helpful tool to mark an important section of the road by drawing virtual path on the map. Additionally, get notifications if vehicle is within or out of route. This feature is useful to analyze vehicle dependency to the road.\n\n- With geofences you are able to make a virtual perimeter on geographic areas that have specific interest for you. The main reason to have geofences is to control whether the unit stays within it or not, so that when the geofencing unit enters or exits the area a notification is generated.\n\n- Get detailed reports about trips, mileage, driving behavior, fuel usage and thefts, activity in particular zone or route. Reports are used for data analysis of particular vehicle or entire group. Reports can be exported or sent instantly to E-mail addresses in HTML/PDF/XLS format.\n\n- Tasks make it easy to create and manage entries related to upcoming work which should be accomplished. Set start and end address, priority, task status.\n\n- The Maintenance schedule reminds you when you should have your vehicle serviced, such as an oil change or technical inspection. It can also serve as a reminder to take out insurance.\n\n- Use the Expenses function to track the amount spent on an object maintenance. Evaluate the economic benefit of vehicle usage with the Expenditure report on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis."

Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

Performance data from the drive system can therefore be combined with the intelligent processing system of the smartphone. This enables a considerably more accurate calculation and display of the remaining range and other values. The shared information can be shown on both displays. When the two devices are paired, the E-Bike display will move into an advanced presentation mode, so that it can show additional functions. The smartphone can then either be mounted on the handlebars as well, to supplement the E-Bike display with an extended functionality, or be kept in your pocket. One of the most important additional functions is navigation, which is provided via the smartphone app. Routes are calculated depending on the range still available and the resulting support mode, then step-by-step direction instructions with distance information will be shown on the E-Bike display.\n\nMain Features:\n\n - Online via the smartphone data connection, or offline, primarily via OpenStreetMaps\n - Routing and navigation with optional altitude profile\n - GPX Track Management: save, import, and share routes\n - Point-Of-Interest (POI) search and directions"

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

Clark, London. \n\nOpenSeaMap data is now accessible from within the app giving the possibility of showing the map data delivered by OpenSeaMap which includes seamarks, navigational rules and buoys in many areas of the world.\n\nFurthermore, you may measure the distance to the ships from your position, as you may measure distance between any two ships. This will show you if they are really on collision course or if it's just an illusion.\n\nSee the ships displayed on the map with large and crystal clear icons.\n\nBuilt-in compass and \"direction\" vector which helps find the direction of the ships and vessels. \n\nFurthermore, images of the ships may be watched or uploaded directly from the app.\n\nThis version supports iOS split screen multitasking found on selected device.\n\nAlso we added the possibility to place user defined waypoints on the map (press and hold your finger on map). The waypoints can be used as measurement points from the user or between ships. Furthermore, by pressing the waypoint the position is copied to the clipboard, making it easy to paste positions into other applications. Pressing the callout of the waypoint will prepare a text message with the position ready to send to other users.Once the text message is received the user can press it and get the position up in various maps apps. This functionality has been requested by search and rescue workers who would like a tool to help pin point positions to colleagues out at sea.\n\nMake sure to check out our FREE version of the app (Trackaship Superlite) before buying if in doubt about the coverage of you local area. The free version will show the same ships, but not any details.\n\nThis app depends on the data received via the Internet and is dependent on the Internet for displaying data. \n\nData is collected on a voluntary basis and may change without notice. If you live in an area with poor or no coverage, you have possibility to improve the situation. Send an email to bbmtrackers@gmail.com and we will contact you. \n\nPlease note that the accuracy and reliability of data in this app are not covered by any guarantee and that, under no circumstances should be used for navigation. This app is no substitute for proper maritime instruments."

It supports HTML 5 + CSS 3, and is based in Webkit. \n\nCroPlus gives you the power to take back control of your Web experience. That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities. Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser. As such, it inherits all the Midori functionalities. It supports many of the most popular parts of the web, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify and Rdio."

      "label": "- No expensive 3G/4G data connection, wifi or internet connection required for voice turn-by-turn navigation. Save on your data usage. Turn your iPhone or iPad into a mobile GPS navigation device.\n- No map download required after initial map download. All maps contained in the app after you download the map bundle as a one off in app purchase.\n- No subscriptions or ongoing costs. Free to use after your initial purchase.\n\nA simple to use, detailed navigation app with spoken instructions in various languages designed specifically for the iPhone and iPad. With this app you no longer have to worry about finding your way to any destination. No need for paper maps. No matter where you are or where the journey takes you, the app can be used anywhere offline. \n\nTravelling? Great for visitors who need a GPS navigation device during their stay without having to spend lots of money on one. Save your data allocation and money as you enjoy street by street navigation without the need for any mobile data connection.\n\nThe app has both off-line and on-line searching. On-line searching requires an internet connection for the actual search and uses very little data. Once the destination has been selected all navigation is off-line and data free.\n\nNOTE - For navigation the app does require that your iPad has a SIM slot (3G/4G slot), as only these iPads have the full GPS capabilities and antennas. You do not need a SIM to be installed for the data free GPS navigation. A WiFi-only iPad does not contain the in-built GPS that a WiFi+Cellular (SIM slot) iPad does and we do not recommend this app for Wifi only iPads. If your iPad is Wifi only, then you will be able to view the entire Spain maps, however full navigation will not function. The app is suitable for all iPhones.\n\n• All map data stored on your iPhone or iPad - no download costs for mapping or navigation after initial map download\n• Full-fledged turn-by-turn voice navigation including street names\n• Local online search for a specific address or place, service and shop. 'Pizza' 'Library' or 'Hostptal'\n• Set your own speed warnings for in and out of town\n• Street sign displays\n• 3D-view, with user options for 2D view during navigation\n• Selectable Route Types - Car efficient, fastest, shortest, Pedestrian (options map turns to north facing or direction), Bike fastest, shortest and quietest\n• Options to avoid toll roads, ferries and highways\n• Automatic night and day mode\n• Up to three alternative routes to choose from\n• Optional setting of a waypoint for a place you want to visit along your route\n• Time remaining in journey, your actual speed and distance remaining\n• Supports landscape and portrait views\n\nRemember for safety sake - do not adjust the settings on this app while driving. The iPad version is perfect for the passenger ‘navigator’. Position your device safely, out of the way of airbags and not obstructing the drivers vision. You are responsible for ensuring the road is safe to travel on. We do not accept responsibility for errors generated by unreported road works or the weather. You assume total responsibility and risk for using this satellite navigation app. Please note that as with all navigation apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can decrease battery faster than normal.\n\nPlease be kind with us for your reviews and ratings and please email admin@outbacktouring.com.au for support or to bug report.

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

Apple iAd advertising is included. To display more than four images and without advertising you need TrafficCamNZ (the paid for version) this can be downloaded from the AppStore.\n\nTrafficCamNZ displays internet accessable pictures of Traffic Cameras. You could use it for any image, even weather maps.\n\nImages you choose as \"Featured\" are downloaded and setup side by side so that you can swipe across the screen to view multiple images quickly.\nTrafficCamNZ works over the cellular network though it works best with WiFi because, usually, it's faster!\n\nThe application comes pre-configured with a small selection of Traffic Cameras from around the world. You can turn those off and turn on the other cameras or add your own specific cameras.\n\nApplication notes:\n* Pictures are displayed in the order they are received so the image arrangement may be different every time you run the application or refresh\n* You will be downloading pictures over your a WiFi or 3G connection - they may be large - you should monitor your network traffic usage\n* Images are not cached, if you recieve an image that isn't right (i.e. daylight when you know it is night time, it may be that the camera is not functioning)\n* Sometimes the traffic camera pictures are not up-to-date on the internet. You may see night puictures when it is supposed to be daylight or perhaps pictures don't change. TrafficCamNZ has no control over that.\n\nFeatures:\n* Flick through the loaded images with your finger\n* Full screen image display for one image with pinch/zoom\n* Load your own web images by specifying a World Wide Web URL, and test before saving\n* Free version available, loads up to 4 images or 6 on iPad\n* Full version available, loads up to 19 images or 44 on iPad\n* Choose your own list of images to display up to the application limit\n* Comes loaded with a selection of Traffic Cameras from around the world. Edit the preferences to turn on the display or turn off the display of the pre-loaded cameras. Remember you cannot display more than four at any one time (or six on iPad) with the free version.\n* Scroll through all of the new images (more than three) in the indexed table view.\n* Tap the image in the main window to display it full screen, tap again for it to go away"

This App gives you the ability to find out all the details of the ship, including size, speed, course, destination, estimated time of arrival and much more. All done with an easy to use and great looking App, which supports both iPhone and iPad.\n\nWhat people are saying about our App: \"Best user interface of any ship app I have tried\" B. Colson, Maine. \"Love the graphical design and the large icons that makes it easy to determine the ship type\" R. Clark, London. \n\nOpenSeaMap data is now accessible from within the app giving the possibility of showing the map data delivered by OpenSeaMap which includes seamarks, navigational rules and buoys in many areas of the world.\n\nFurthermore, you may measure the distance to the ships from your position, as you may measure distance between any two ships. This will show you if they are really on collision course or if it's just an illusion.\n\nSee the ships displayed on the map with large and crystal clear icons.\n\nBuilt-in compass and \"direction\" vector which helps find the direction of the ships and vessels. \n\nFurthermore, images of the ships may be watched or uploaded directly from the app.\n\nThis version supports iOS split screen multitasking found on selected device.\n\nAlso we added the possibility to place user defined waypoints on the map (press and hold your finger on map). The waypoints can be used as measurement points from the user or between ships. Furthermore, by pressing the waypoint the position is copied to the clipboard, making it easy to paste positions into other applications. Pressing the callout of the waypoint will prepare a text message with the position ready to send to other users.Once the text message is received the user can press it and get the position up in various maps apps. This functionality has been requested by search and rescue workers who would like a tool to help pin point positions to colleagues out at sea.\n\nMake sure to check out our FREE version of the app (Trackaship Superlite) before buying if in doubt about the coverage of you local area. The free version will show the same ships, but not any details.\n\nThis app depends on the data received via the Internet and is dependent on the Internet for displaying data. \n\nData is collected on a voluntary basis and may change without notice. If you live in an area with poor or no coverage, you have possibility to improve the situation. Send an email to bbmtrackers@gmail.com and we will contact you. \n\nPlease note that the accuracy and reliability of data in this app are not covered by any guarantee and that, under no circumstances should be used for navigation. This app is no substitute for proper maritime instruments."

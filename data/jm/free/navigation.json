When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

It supports HTML 5 + CSS 3, and is based in Webkit. \n\nCroPlus gives you the power to take back control of your Web experience. That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities. Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser. As such, it inherits all the Midori functionalities. It supports many of the most popular parts of the web, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify and Rdio."

This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "Welcome to iSpeedCam - the most advanced Traffic Enforcement Camera warning system for the iPhone world. It handles various types of traffic cameras, speed limits in metric and imperial unit systems, and a map feature using Apple Maps enhanced with track recording, provided you have internet connection (!) and it issues various statistics about your routes. As most radar detectors draw your attention too late about photo enforcement systems, iSpeedCam might be your ultimate companion to avoid costly speed tickets.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Alerts for fixed traffic cameras and regular police stakeout spots, red light cameras\n- Editable speed camera database\n- One-touch Add / Remove camera\n- POI backup and restore feature\n- Import your personal POI files from the supporting web application (Currently it supports the Garmin, MapMonkey, MIO and IGO formats)\n- Graphical GPS tracking*\n- Track statistics\n- Metric / Imperial unit system\n- Multitasking support*\n- Battery power saving mode\n- Thorough help\n- More ...\n\nCAMERA DATABASE\n\niSpeedCam has an impressive speed trap database covering the European Countries, UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and all Asian countries in the world-wide version of the application. Nevertheless, we are aware that there are no official camera databases, and the available traffipax databases either show superfluous camera locations or lack them all together, regardless of their claim. iSpeedCam allows you to tailor the camera database with one touch by adding new cameras or filtering out the unwanted ones. Later on, you can backup and restore these cameras directly from your device.\n\nAmong various useful features you have the ability to import your favorite POI files, that contain the cameras for your locations. Download or create your own Garmin, MapMonkey, MIO or IGO speed camera (POI) files and sync it to your device using the supporting web application.\n\nFOLLOW YOUR ROAD\n\nWhile you are on the road iSpeedCam displays the outline of your current track overlaid on Apple Maps and calculates a several statistics about it, e.g. your track distance, its total time, maximum speed achieved, etc. These tracks are recorded and saved in the iSpeedcam's database, so you will be able to review them later. The GPS tracking feature works with and without internet connection as well.\n\nTAILOR IT TO YOUR NEEDS\n\niSpeedCam works both with the metric and imperial unit systems, so you can customize not only the speed camera database, but also the warning distances, the camera types to be warned about, etc.\n\nYou also have FREE UPDATE  to the newest version, where among other new features you can use your Facebook account to Like or Share the application.\n\nAccess your FREE iSpeedCam account (http://www.ispeedcam.com/upload) via Facebook, where you can:\n- Link devices to your Facebook account\n- Sync custom POI files across multiple devices\n- Display your custom POI files on Google Maps\n\n* Note: Continued use of the GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nBecome a fan of iSpeedCam on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/ISpeedCam"

      "label": "CamerAlert is a self-contained Speed and Red Light Camera warning system using data from the renowned PocketGPSWorld.com Speed Camera Database.  Whilst you drive, it provides audible and visual warnings as you approach speed camera locations as well as giving your average speed during SPECs cameras. CamerAlert uses directional information to reduce false alerts, you are only warned of cameras that are relevant to your direction of travel.\n\nFeatured in The Sunday Times Top 500 Apps Worldwide\n\nSUPPORT: We ALWAYS reply to support requests.  If you've logged a support ticket and you have not received a reply within 24hrs MAX then please check your junkmail or spam filters.\n\nTIP FOR BETTER NOTIFICATIONS: In the main iPhone settings go to Notifications. From the list select CamerAlert & then choose the 'Alert' notification type. This will keep a blue pop up on screen until you have passed the camera. The default is the 'Banner' type which vanishes after 2 seconds.\n\nMIRRORED DISPLAY:  If your display is mirrored, then you have the \"Mirror Display\" option enabled in settings.  This is explained in the user-guide - please take a moment to read it before posting a negative review\n\nCamerAlert has two distinct modes: Map and List.  In Map mode you are shown a map with the cameras located on it. In List mode you are shown a list of all the cameras in your vicinity. You can see the camera type, distance & direction. CamerAlert supports multitasking so you can run it in combination with your preference of Navigation App.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:  CamerAlert requires iOS 9.0 minimum and supports iPhone 3G, 4 & 4S and all iPad 3G models. It will not function on non-3G iPad or iPod Touch unless you use an Apple approved GPS receiver accessory. Map mode requires a data connection. iPod Touch users or those wishing to avoid mobile internet use (or whilst roaming) can run the app in list mode which uses no data.\n\nIMPORTANT:  CamerAlert, when first installed, has a demo Speed Camera Database.  To ensure you have the latest camera data we include a free trial subscription, after which you will need to subscribe for updates.  You do not need to register for the free trial.\n\nIn-App subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes account after you confirm the purchase, they do not auto-renew at the end of the purchased period.  In-App subscriptions require registration to allow you to restore and use your subscription on all of your devices.\n\nIn-App subscriptions are £3.99 for one month, £8.99 for 3 months or £19.99 for 12 months. The database is updated on a weekly basis.\n\nIf you are not an existing subscriber you can subscribe via Apple's In-App Purchase service to ensure continued access to updates.  In-App subscriptions can be only be used on iOS devices linked to the Apple ID used to make the original In-App purchase.\n\nPocketGPSWorld.com Ltd subscribers can use their annual membership for camera updates by linking within the app.\n\nAnother feature, unique to this app, is that the latest data can be downloaded over the air at any time (mobile internet or WiFi required) to ensure you have the most up-to-date speed camera information available at all times.\n\nIf you see a camera that is not in the database then you can report it using CamerAlert.  This feature can also be used to change information about a camera already in the database i.e. changing speed or direction information. \n\nDisclaimer:  The use of a speed camera warning device may not be legal in all countries and territories.  Continued use of GPS can dramatically decrease battery life. External power is advised.\n\nPrivacy and Terms\nFor privacy and terms please visit http://www.cameralert.com/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield. Our app is very customizable, especially if you’ve unlocked our themes. You can choose the look and display according to your needs: your mood, eyesight, night or day. Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe. Focus on the road ahead and do not interact with any device when you are driving, especially when you are driving at high speed.\n\nLove Speedometer One!

The GPS tracks are stored on your iPhone and optionally in iCloud. There is no need to register or login to any internet service. Your tracks are your tracks.\n\nYou can start and stop individual GPS recordings or use the power-saving diary mode. Using this mode myTracks automatically creates a single track for each day with the most important locations.\n\nThe integrated Apple Watch app displays information about the current GPS recording. This includes the starting time, distance traveled, current, minimum and maximum elevation. Since myTracks 5 you can record tracks directly using Apple Watch.\n\nHere is an overview of the main features of myTracks:\n- GPS Recording: You record GPS tracks using iPhone or Apple Watch. There is no need for an active internet connection.\n- Maps: The tracks are shown on pixel or vector maps based on OpenStreetMap.\n- Offline Maps: myTracks provides offline vector maps for every country of the world. Once an offline map has been loaded to your iPhone you can zoom in to any detail of the map without an internet connection. The pixel maps also supports the download of offline maps.\n- Track Organization: You can organize your tracks using folders, e.g. a folder for a year a folder for a holiday.\n- Export and Sharing: Tracks can be exported as GPX, KML or KMZ files. \n- Diary Mode: myTracks has a special recording mode called Diary Mode. Once this mode has been started myTracks creates a single track for each day. It uses a power efficient iOS feature called \"major location changes\". The Diary Mode can be switched on all the time without drilling down your battery.\n- Search: Within myTracks you can search for addresses or special points (POIs).\n- iCloud: All your tracks and the folder structure is synchronized between all your Apple device, both iOS and macOS.\n- Apple Watch: myTracks contains an Apple Watch App with quick access to all major features and information of your recording. It can also be used for direct track recording.\n- Track Import: GPS tracks can be imported to the track library from other apps using the GPX file format.\n- myTracks is ad-free\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nLANGUAGES:\n- English\n- German\n- French\n- Japanese"

      "label": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map.\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap on a ship to see it's name, type and destination. Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

You can turn those off and turn on the other cameras or add your own specific cameras.\n\nApplication notes:\n* Pictures are displayed in the order they are received so the image arrangement may be different every time you run the application or refresh\n* You will be downloading pictures over your a WiFi or 3G connection - they may be large - you should monitor your network traffic usage\n* Images are not cached, if you recieve an image that isn't right (i.e. daylight when you know it is night time, it may be that the camera is not functioning)\n* Sometimes the traffic camera pictures are not up-to-date on the internet. You may see night puictures when it is supposed to be daylight or perhaps pictures don't change. TrafficCamNZ has no control over that.\n\nFeatures:\n* Flick through the loaded images with your finger\n* Full screen image display for one image with pinch/zoom\n* Load your own web images by specifying a World Wide Web URL, and test before saving\n* Free version available, loads up to 4 images or 6 on iPad\n* Full version available, loads up to 19 images or 44 on iPad\n* Choose your own list of images to display up to the application limit\n* Comes loaded with a selection of Traffic Cameras from around the world. Edit the preferences to turn on the display or turn off the display of the pre-loaded cameras.

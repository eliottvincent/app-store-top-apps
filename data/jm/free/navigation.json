It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "iStreets provides simple and easy access to Google's Street View imagery on your iOS device.\n\nWith search powered by Google Places, simply enter a query such as \"Restaurants in London\" and a list of relevant locations will appear on screen. You can then tap to view street view, share or get directions (via Apple Maps or iMaps+).\n\nAlternatively, drag the yellow peg man from the top left hand corner of the map and release over a road or path to access street view.\n\nStreet view supports zooming in and out, and showing a mini-map overlay. There is also a full screen mode for a more immersive experience.\n\nIf you need a more complete Google Maps experience, look for \"iMaps+ for Google Maps\" on the App Store. iMaps+ provides all the great functionality from iStreets with the addition of directions, traffic, contacts integration and more.\n\n\nNotes:\n\nSubscriptions: iStreets operates as a subscription service. Recurring purchase is required for full functionality. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed, and auto-renewal may be turned off, from iStreets settings or the Apple Settings app. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited if you change your subscription term.\n\nDirections, street view and live traffic details are only available in certain geographical regions.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nTerms of Service: http://apptility.co.uk/imaps_tos.html\n\nApptility Limited is not related to, or affiliated with, Google, Inc.

That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities. Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser.

For public transport, you also have the option of setting an arrival/departure time.\n- Set up notifications to fire when you arrive at a specific location.\n- Record journeys such as a hike, bike ride or road trip, even while the app is in the background. Recorded routes are saved and can be recalled at any time.

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map.\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap on a ship to see it's name, type and destination. Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

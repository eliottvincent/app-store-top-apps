Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit.

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service.

When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account.

      "label": "The GPS Phone Tracking App makes it easy to keep track of life’s essentials; use it to:\n\n• Find Your Friends – and get directions to their location.\n• Find Your Phone – check the app’s Web site to find a lost device.\n• Stay Connected – discover your friends’ whereabouts at any time simply by checking the GPS Phone Tracking map.\n\nThe GPS Phone Tracking does it all.\nThis handy, easy-to-use app leverages the latest technology to help you stay connected in real time to the people (and the devices) that matter most. GPS Phone Tracking functions, features and benefits include:\n\nGreat Friend Locator.\nGPS Phone Tracking uses GPS coordinates and state-of-the-art GPS location data to report the real-time whereabouts of your friends. Simply install the GPS tracker app on your phone and your friends’ phones. Once registered, each friend appears as a unique icon on the GPS Tracking Pro’s navigational map so you’ll know exactly where each friend is, at all times. Want to know instantly which friends arrived at a party, theater, museum or another planned meet up point? Want to figure out if anyone is stuck in traffic, made a wrong turn or even worse – if your habitually late friend has even left his/her house yet? No need to send annoying “Where are your?” or “What’s your ETA?” texts, GPS Phone Tracking puts this information at your fingertips. And to make life super easy, GPS Tracking Pro can send alerts the moment your friends arrive at the appointed location!\n\nFriend Locator\nWith GPS Phone Tracking, you can monitor your friend’s travel from one location to another via the app’s GPS maps. This is a very helpful feature when you’re traveling separately from a friend who has a tendency to get lost often. And let’s face it: GPS Phone Tracking also makes a great family tracker. This is especially helpful if a family member is scheduled to pick you up. You can track their progress toward your destination, enjoying yourself until the last possible moment you have to be at the agreed upon pick up spot!\n\nReliable Cell Phone Tracker\nGPS Phone Tracking can pinpoint the location of registered mobile devices, smart phones and even old school feature phones via the app’s website, 24/7. Just log in and your phone will appear as an icon. Click on the icon to view the location of the missing mobile phone. This GPS phone tracking device helps with iPhone too. It accesses GPS iPhone data to pinpoint the location of missing Droids.\n\nPhone Tracking for Friends With Feature Phones\nFriends who don’t have the latest smart phone (or a smart phone at all), can still enjoy GPS Phone Tracking’s features and benefits – with a little help from their friends! Here’s how it works: The app will send a text invite to the feature phone. Once your friend accepts the invitation and replies with a “yes,” to the text, their individual icon will appear on the app’s GPS maps. If their phone is lost, the app will provide GPS navigation assistance to help you guide them its destination. It’s a phone tracker extraordinaire.\n\nInnovative and Versatile Phone Locator\nDo you constantly misplace your cell phone and are tired of asking other people (friends or family) to help you find it or if they’ve seen it? GPS Phone Tracking can help. Its state-of-the-art GPS system can keep tabs on registered phones, using satellites to triangulate the exact location of every phone registered to your account. If a phone is ever out of satellite view, GPS Phone Tracking uses triangulation via the nearest cell phone tower and the cell phone carrier’s data to determine the missing phone’s location. This versatile phone locator also offers printer-friendly directions to the misplaced phone’s location. GPS Phone Tracking is compatible with iPhone, whether you have AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or another phone carrier."

The all-new WalkSafe+ app provides safety at your fingertips, giving you the tools to make informed decisions about your personal safety. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n- Journey planner: Plan your journeys and save your favourite locations for easy access.\n\n- Trusted friend circle: Build a trusted circle of friends who can view your location and share their own journeys. No one outside of your trusted circle will be able to see your location, not strangers or big brother.\n\n- Street crime reports: Visualise serious street crime reports as icons with the WalkSafe Map, all information is based on verified police crime data. \n\n- Community safety: Help others by posting safety icons to the WalkSafe map. All community icons are verified by admins to uphold user safety.\n\n- Hotspot Alerts: Get alerts when you walk near areas that have seen reports of serious crimes such as knife attacks, sexual assault, violent attacks and muggings.\n\n- SOS button: Alert ALL of your trusted friends even if they are not viewing your location.\n\nPERSONAL SAFETY TOOLS\n\nNo one can predict where the next crime will be. However, we believe being informed and staying alert is the key to staying safer.\n\nWe use up-to-date, accurate, and verified police data, empowering you with street safety information. The app will help you choose the safest routes while walking, spot patterns in criminal behaviour, and stay safe.\n\n- HomeSafe: Protect yourself and protect others with HomeSafe. Set a specific place and a specific time, and share your journey plan with loved ones. If you don't successfully complete your journey, your loved ones are notified. (This feature is non-location sharing).\n\n- WalkSafe Journeys: Going somewhere? WalkSafe journeys differ from HomeSafe by allowing you to share your location with your trusted friends. Your location will update in real-time allowing your loved ones to keep you safe on your journey.\n\n- Activity Map: Our map shows police and WalkSafe community reports of dangers such as knife crime, sexual assault & mugging​​. WalkSafe automatically alerts you when you walk near these dangers. Use this information to plan safer routes and post live updates in your local area.

      "label": "Turn your iPhone and iPad into a Speedometer with Speedometer One! Speedometer One is also suitable for cars, boats, motorcycles, or other types of vehicles. We have various features to make Speedometer the best speed tracker app for IOS devices. We use GPS to track your speed and alert you when you are over the speed limit. There are other features that will be useful for you such as Night Mode, HUD screen, and many more.  \n\nHave you ever driven a car and worried that you go over the speed limit? Driving too fast can get you into trouble especially if there are some traffic cops nearby with their speed radar gun. That’s why we add Speed Limit Alert as one of the most important features of our app. You can enable and disable it. We support US and EU style speed limit signs and support different display units. This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield.

Our customization is what sets us apart from other similar apps. Try it for yourself today!\n\nIMPORTANT USAGE NOTE: \n\n\t•\tTo be able to use Speedometer One, please allow Location Services.  \n\t•\tSet what kind of vehicle you use and the max speed before using. \n\t•\tSpeedometer One is not compatible with Wifi only iPad or iPod Touch. \n\t•\tOur speed tracker is based on GPS info. GPS sensor is not always accurate due to the device hardware sensor limitation. When in doubt, always rely on your car’s speedometer.\n\t•\tGPS is most accurate when you are in wide-open spaces. Trees, tall buildings, and other things might affect your GPS accuracy. \n\t•\tProlong use of GPS will affect your battery life. \n\t•\tPlease stay safe.

      "label": "With GPS Tracker application you can transform your iOS mobile device to GPS tracker (GPS tracking device) and use all GPS-server.net features. In order to use this application, you must have personal account or hosted software.\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS Tracker running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. If you want better battery life, set tracking interval to at least 60-120 seconds.\n\nGPS Tracker features:\n- Track your device online in real time;\n- Record and review tracks, generate reports;\n- Configure various kinds of events and notifications;\n- Assign or schedule various tasks and delivery times;\n- Communicate with the person at the other end using built-in chat function;\n- Make photos and upload to user account with current location;\n- Possibility to change tracking interval;\n- Phone battery level is sent together with every location;\n- If Internet is lost, application will save locations and upload them later;\n- Possibility to control application via web browser using commands;\n- Password protection;\n- Application runs in background.\n\nGPS-server.net features:\n- Real time tracking mode represents live data of tracked objects. Information is updated every ten seconds without need to refresh page or relogin to account. Monitored data contains vehicle status, latitude, longitude, altitude, address, speed, connection time, ignition status, fuel consumption, sensor data, nearest geozone and much more.\n\n- Widgets display recent object information which is updated every ten seconds without need to refresh web page. Send commands to control device, view recent events and mileage graph.\n\n- Events is one of the most important feature which our software offers. Events are used to trigger actions by important or disruptive activities. Customer will get instant SMS/E-mail/Push notifications triggered by different event types.\n\n- History shows all stored data which server has collected from connected devices for chosen period of time. Software stores information received from GPS tracking devices, such as speed, time, location, stops, reports, events, etc. History is displayed in different ways: visually on the map, in a graph or HTML/XLS format.\n\n- POI (Points of Interest) allow you to put markers at the locations that might be interesting or useful. You can also name the place, add short description, attach an image or even video to it.\n\n- Routes feature is a helpful tool to mark an important section of the road by drawing virtual path on the map. Additionally, get notifications if vehicle is within or out of route. This feature is useful to analyze vehicle dependency to the road.\n\n- With geofences you are able to make a virtual perimeter on geographic areas that have specific interest for you. The main reason to have geofences is to control whether the unit stays within it or not, so that when the geofencing unit enters or exits the area a notification is generated.\n\n- Get detailed reports about trips, mileage, driving behavior, fuel usage and thefts, activity in particular zone or route. Reports are used for data analysis of particular vehicle or entire group. Reports can be exported or sent instantly to E-mail addresses in HTML/PDF/XLS format.\n\n- Tasks make it easy to create and manage entries related to upcoming work which should be accomplished. Set start and end address, priority, task status.\n\n- The Maintenance schedule reminds you when you should have your vehicle serviced, such as an oil change or technical inspection. It can also serve as a reminder to take out insurance.\n\n- Use the Expenses function to track the amount spent on an object maintenance. Evaluate the economic benefit of vehicle usage with the Expenditure report on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map.\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap on a ship to see it's name, type and destination. Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

You can turn those off and turn on the other cameras or add your own specific cameras.\n\nApplication notes:\n* Pictures are displayed in the order they are received so the image arrangement may be different every time you run the application or refresh\n* You will be downloading pictures over your a WiFi or 3G connection - they may be large - you should monitor your network traffic usage\n* Images are not cached, if you recieve an image that isn't right (i.e. daylight when you know it is night time, it may be that the camera is not functioning)\n* Sometimes the traffic camera pictures are not up-to-date on the internet. You may see night puictures when it is supposed to be daylight or perhaps pictures don't change. TrafficCamNZ has no control over that.\n\nFeatures:\n* Flick through the loaded images with your finger\n* Full screen image display for one image with pinch/zoom\n* Load your own web images by specifying a World Wide Web URL, and test before saving\n* Free version available, loads up to 4 images or 6 on iPad\n* Full version available, loads up to 19 images or 44 on iPad\n* Choose your own list of images to display up to the application limit\n* Comes loaded with a selection of Traffic Cameras from around the world.

      "label": "What is ReadAloud?\nReadAloud is a simple but sophisticated app which can take any text of your choice: websites, emails, ebooks, PDFs, Word documents…. And read it aloud to you.\nYou can choose from nearly 100 virtual actors, speaking a range of languages and accents. There are male and female voices, old and young, cheerful and serious, so you can match the audio to the material.\nIf the text you need to read is a hard copy, not a digital file, that’s no problem too: just photograph the page, and ReadAloud will scan and read the image. You can even speed up or slow down the reading, to suit your own pace.\nWhat can ReadAloud read?\nReadAloud can handle almost any text, in a wide range of formats. It can read aloud in 21 languages, from Arabic to Welsh. ReadAloud can also speak in different accents, such as Australian English or Mexican Spanish.\nThe home screen offers two options: Library or Browser. The Browser can read any website you point it to, in one of the many supported languages. To get you started, the app offers a range of news and magazine sites, including the BBC, NY Times, and Wikipedia.\nThese recommended sites will keep you up to date with what’s happening in the world. But of course you can add your own Favorites, creating a unique personalized menu which reflects your interests.\nThe Browser page also includes a search bar to find the content of your choice, and will remember your search history so you can find that fascinating story when you want to listen again.\nThe Library is where you find your books and documents. You can easily upload text in a number of common formats, including .txt, Rich Text Format, Word documents and PDFs.\nRead Aloud will also read images of text. If you don’t have a scanner, you can simply take a picture of the page with your phone’s camera, and ReadAloud will read it aloud for you!\nTurn ebooks into audiobooks\nAudiobooks are increasingly popular, as a way of enjoying a good book anytime, anywhere. But what if the book you want to listen to isn’t available on Audible? No problem if you have ReadAloud. Just upload any ebook fom your Kindle or iPad to the TTS app, and it instantly becomes an audiobook!\nSave money too- instead of paying $20 for an audiobook, or $15 for an Audible subscription, borrow ebooks from Hoopla or ZLibrary, or get free stories from Wattpad, iReader, or Goodreads, and convert them to audio.\nWho might use ReadAloud?\n•\tA commuter connecting to CarPlay to listen to the news on the way to work\n•\tA teacher helping her students learn to read\n•\tAn avid reader listening to their favorite book while doing housework\n•\tA creator of podcasts uploading their script to convert it to narration\n•\tA student revising text books at the gym, learning as they work out\nHow does it work?\nReadAloud uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. TTS is a rapidly developing area of artificial intelligence which uses software to analyze text and convert it to human-sounding speech.\nMost people will be familiar with TTS voices from Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. Alexa can be found on Amazon’s Echo smart speakers, while Siri is available on a range of Apple products, from iPads to Apple Watches.\nAnother popular application for this technology was Narrator’s Voice, which allowed users to brighten up their messages by having them read aloud by virtual voices. Users could also apply a range of fun effects.\nThe flipside of text-to-speech technology is audio-to-text (ATT), which takes audio files and converts them to documents. The leading ATT converter is Transcribe, although it’s still a developing technology.\nReadAloud represents the next generation of TTS apps, allowing the user to listen to entire books and webpages instead of just short messages.\nTerms of Use: https://hwmpy.peiyinduoduo.com/yhxy_wzzyy_en.html \nPrivacy policy: https://hwmpy.peiyinduoduo.com/yszc_wzzyy_en.html"

Be the first to know about weather, news, and crime updates.\n\nThanks for making 5-0 Radio the most downloaded police scanner app on the market. This app is one of top 100 most downloaded iOS apps since 2009 with tens of millions of users.\n\nFeatures\n======\n- New “Feeds with Active Alerts” feature that shows you feeds with interesting on-going activity and breaking news happening right now along with a description of the alert, breaking info, location, and feed.\n- Listen to feeds in the background. You can run other apps while listening to the police. Pause the feeds via the media controls on your device.\n- Automatically attempts to reconnect the feed if you lose the connection.\n- Listen to feeds on your desktop/laptop computer. Email yourself a link to the feed, and open that link on your browser or with your favorite mp3 player.\n- Ability to add custom feeds\n- Chat with other users\n- The web browser also automatically detects feeds and integrates it with the radio. Now you can add feeds from the web by simply tapping on the feed's link via our browser.\n- Share feeds with your friends by email. They do not need to buy this app to listen with you. They can listen in with any device that has a web browser.\n- Worldwide coverage. Listen to feeds from the United States, Canada, Australia and more. Our app is always expanding and looking for new police radios to tap into.\n- List scanners by county. Don't just list all feeds in a state, get only the ones that are from your city/county.\n- Integrated map that finds your location and the location of the feed. Now you can find where the action is happening and follow along.\n- Built-in police/EMS/fire/military codes and phonetic alphabet for easy interpretation. Good for any beginners who do not have the proper training and have trouble remembering what the codes mean.\n- Save your favorites to the front screen of the app for quick one-tap access.\n- This app will dynamically grab a new list of sources so that you will always be the first to get any new police feeds out there.\n- See the popularity of each feed. Each feed lists the number of listeners who are following the action along with you.\n- Choose new skins or make your own. Skins can be any photo you choose from your photos library.\n- New police feeds and others are added on an hourly basis, so keep checking if we added yours recently.\n\nUpgrade to 5-0 Radio Pro to remove ads, add even more feeds, and new features.\n\nLegality\n======\nIt is legal in most countries to listen to police feeds. However, it is illegal in some places to use this app to aid in the commission of a crime or to pose as a police officer when you are not. It may also be illegal to use it while driving. Please consult your local laws before using this app outside of your home.\n\nIs it fake?\n=======\nIt's very real. Each feed comes from a person in that region with an expensive police scanner sharing the signal with you via the internet.\n\nReal-time\n=======\nThe delay between the real radio feed and this app is only a few seconds depending on buffering and internet speeds.\n\nRecommendations\n==============\nCheck out our website SmartestApple.com for other great free apps from us"

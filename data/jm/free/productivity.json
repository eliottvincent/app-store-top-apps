      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

      "label": "Widgetsmith lets you personalize your home screen and lock screen like never before.  \n\nIt starts with a wide collection of highly customizable widgets, which range in function from photos, to date, to weather, to astronomy.  Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance.  \n\nThis set of widgets can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define.  For example, a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your work day, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day.  This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\nActivity widgets require a paired Apple Watch\n\nThe app itself also includes a wide collection of tools, such as a weather app, a timezone converter, a calendar.  These tools can automatically launch based on the active widget tapped.\n\nNotes:\n • Widgetsmith optionally integrates with Apple Health.  This data is used to display your step and activity if you select one of those widget types.  Permission for Widgetsmith to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.  \n• Widgetsmith includes an optional premium subscription.  This is offered on a monthly or annual basis.  If you choose to purchase a subscription your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\n• Access to Tide and Weather hosted data is only available to Widgetsmith Premium subscribers.\n\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith_privacy.html\nTerms of Use: https://david-smith.org/widgetsmith-terms-of-use.html"

Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

Unlike other cloud storage providers, your data is encrypted and decrypted by your client devices only and never by us.\n\nUpload files from your smartphone or tablet, then search, store, download, stream, view, share, rename or delete them any time, from any device, anywhere. Share folders with your contacts and see their updates in real time.\n\nMEGA’s strong and secure end-to-end encryption means we cannot access or reset your password. You MUST remember your password and make sure to back up your account Recovery Key. Losing your password and the account Recovery Key will result in lost access to your files.\n\nUse the included MEGA Secure Chat for end-to-end-encrypted communications, including video and audio calls, with total privacy. Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency. The code of our iOS mobile app is located at: https://github.com/meganz/ios\n\nSubscriptions renew automatically for successive periods of the same duration at the same price as the initial period chosen. You can cancel the automatic renewal of your MEGA Pro subscription no later than 24 hours before your next subscription payment is due, via your iTunes account settings page. To manage your subscriptions, tap on the App Store icon on your device, sign in with your Apple ID at the bottom of the page (if you haven’t already done so) and then tap View ID. You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions. From there, you can select your MEGA Pro subscription and view your scheduled renewal date, choose a different subscription package or toggle the on-off switch to off to disable the auto-renewal of your subscription.\n\nTerms of Service: https://mega.io/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://mega.io/privacy"

      "label": "Forfeit is a hardcore commitment contract app.\n\nYou say what you're going to do, when you're going to do it, and how much money you'll lose if you don't do it. You must send photo/timelapse evidence by the time limit, or we take your money.\n\nA good example is the gym: I know I probably won't be able to wake up and be at the gym at 6am tomorrow, but if I have to submit photo evidence inside it by tomorrow or lose $10, I'll definitely be there!\n\nBased off the Habit Contract methodology explained in Atomic Habits, Forfeit is pretty much bulletproof at forcing you to complete the habits that are tough to motivate yourself to do. \n\nSome examples are:\n• I will hit 30km on my Peloton before 8AM, or I'll Forfeit $10\n• I will submit a photo of myself awake and downstairs by 9AM, or I'll Forfeit $10\n• I will submit a time-lapse of myself meditating uninterrupted for 30 minutes by 10AM, or I'll Forfeit $5\n• I will submit a photo of my completed history essay by 9PM, or I'll Forfeit $5\n• I will record a 10km run by 3PM or I'll Forfeit $5\n\nLaunched in Summer 2022, users have set 1000+ forfeits and staked over $10k+.\n\nMore features:\n\nAVERAGES: Stay above a certain percentage, or your money is lost.\nSELF-VERIFY: No need to submit evidence if you don't want to - just verify that you completed the task.\nRECURRING FORFEITS: Set forfeits to regenerate for up to 90 days, on any specific set of days that you want.\nMANUAL VERIFICATION: Our team manically verifies your forfeits - no need for an accountability buddy."

      "label": "Have your books read aloud to you!\n\nNaturalReader - Text To Speech is a mobile app that can read aloud your text, documents, and books, allowing you to listen instead of reading.\n\nListen to books, webpages, pdfs, cloud documents, images, notes, e-Learning content, and more with NaturalReader - Text To Speech.\n\nOur app was created to help our users save time, be more productive, and assist with reading. Finding time in a busy schedule to sit down and read can be nearly impossible, but with NaturalReader you don’t have to!\n\nJust like a podcast or audiobook, our app lets you be productive anywhere with your mobile device. Complete readings laying in bed, during your daily commute, or walking around campus. By listening on the go, you create more time to do what you love.\n\nNaturalReader is also an essential reading tool for those with dyslexia and other reading difficulties. By presenting the text both audibly and visually, readers can focus less on the act of reading, and more on the content they are reading. We also offer a dyslexia-friendly font for closed captions and within our text box.\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\nListening to our app couldn't be easier! Simply choose the document type you wish to upload, select you’re desired file, and you are ready to start listening. For the best experience, remember to choose your favorite speaker’s voice and optimal listening speed.\n\nHere are just a few of the reasons why our 1,000,000 monthly users love using NaturalReader - Text To Speech:\n\n-- Camera Scanner: Listen to physical books and notes by using your mobile camera. Convert any piece of physical text into audio, which reads aloud to you. Just take a picture of the pages you wish to upload and you’re ready to start listening.\n\n-- Natural Voices: Enjoy over 100+ Voices across 15+ Languages to choose from, including our plus voices, the newest and highest technology of AI voices.\nPlus voices enable fluid, natural-sounding text to speech that matches the patterns and intonation of human voices. Plus voices are available through our Plus Subscription plan.\n\n-- AI Text Filtering: Choose to filter out distracting and unwanted text such as URLs and text within brackets. Our advanced AI technology will detect these types of text and ignore them, limiting any distractions.\n\n-- Customizable Experience: We have loaded our app with features built to create the most natural listening experience for our users. Choose your preferred speaker voice and optimal reading speed for the best experience.\nOther features ways to customize include a dark mode, word highlight, closed captions and an advanced pronunciation editor for new or unusual words, or to improve the readability of acronyms.\n\n-- Cross-Device Compatibility: A free NaturalReader account gives you access to our Mobile App, Online Reader and Chrome Extension. Run out of time? Seamlessly continue listening from your desktop computer to your mobile device.\n\nSupported Formats:\nPDF, MS Word (.doc & .docx), MS Powerpoint, Mac documents, RTF, TXT, DRM-free EPUB eBooks, image files (png, jpg...)"

We've tried all the apps that let you do it over WiFi, but they're not fast enough, so we also allow you to use a wired USB connection.\n\nQUALITY VIDEO\nYour iPhone/iPad camera's are good, really good. In fact, there’s no comparison between the highly recommended streaming webcam, the Logitech C922 HD Pro and the iPhone 6 Camera. Stream Landscape or Portrait video.\n\nAUDIO\nIf you don't have a separate mic for your streaming setup, you can now use the microphone on your iOS device to stream audio & video.\n\nFRONT CAMERA\nStream a selfie with the front camera support. Switch anytime during the stream with the familiar camera switch button.\n\nTAP TO FOCUS, PINCH TO ZOOM\nControls just like you're used to from the Camera app.\n\nMANUAL CONTROLS\nTake control of the focus, exposure, white balance as you would on a manual DSLR camera.\n\nLOW LATENCY\nStream video over a wired USB connection. This avoids the issue of delay over wifi, as many other solutions suffer from. This is just as fast as a USB webcam!\n\nUSB & WIFI\nChoose the connection type. If you want low latency, use USB, if you'd like portability then use WiFi. WiFi is done using the NewTek™ NDI® protocol, so you can use Camera for OBS Studio with any NewTek™ NDI® compatible receiver.\n\nREMOTE CONTROL\nControl the app from your web browser on your computer. No need to have access to the device anymore to line up that shot perfectly.\n\nMULTIPLE DEVICES\nIf you're lucky enough to own multiple iOS devices, use them together and produce a multi-camera stream.\n\nMAC AND PC\nSupports OBS Studio running on macOS and Windows.\n\nYou will need to install the OBS Studio iOS Camera Plugin from our website, or use an NDI compatible receiver to use this app.\n\nFor the best possible experience make sure your device is listed on our website https://obs.camera/docs/faqs/#what-ios-hardware-do-i-need\n\n\nMORE\n\nSubscriptions will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.

In the late 1990’s, David’s material first appeared on the Blue Letter Bible, and was found to be a valuable resource.\n\nDavid’s Bible resources – both in text and through audio and video – are used by many thousands of people every day.

We are the only phone directory that has patented our advanced, transparent search technology assuring you updated and accurate information. \n\nMajor version release 2.0 brings an entirely redesigned interface incorporating innovative suggestions from our users.  If somebody called you or contacted you via social media and you're trying to find out who owns the number, use our app to quickly do a \"reverse lookup\" and determine who called you. \n\nNew features in Version 2.0:\n-Global Caller ID now allows search of over 1 billion phone numbers worldwide! Our free version covers ~60% of numbers - the best free service available. \n\n-Maps Geolocation shows approximate area by area code.\n\n-All new Social Media directory to publish your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and email addresses in our phone directory!\n\n-Crowdsourced voting and comments on SPAM numbers, prank callers, telemarketers, etc.\n\n-Dialing format and timezone gives you all the information you need on foreign / international contacts.\n\n\nMost (if not all) cellular phone carriers do not offer the full caller ID service that exists for landline phones. When someone calls a mobile phone, the cell phone caller ID leaves out the name, only showing the phone number and/or city of the caller. Real caller ID shows the number & name of the caller. Since 2013, Greenflight has offered this invaluable free & real caller ID utility for the iOS architecture.\n\nThis tool may only be used to research phone numbers that called you or contacted you via social media. All use must comply with applicable international, federal, and local laws. The Caller-ID service is not a consumer reporting agency as by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n\nFor Caller ID Pro Edition subscriptions, a free trial three day trial is available for first time users.  After the free trial finishes, premium membership for up to 30 searches/month is available for $9.49 a month. \n\nPayment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase, or end of trial period, if applicable. Subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\n• Terms of Service: https://www.okcaller.com/tos.php\n• Privacy Policy: https://www.okcaller.com/privacy.php\nOur data is derived from transparent and open processes specified Greenflight owned USPTO patents and/or reissues."

      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App & #1 Prayer App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed.

It doesn't have any complicated features, and it doesn't send you push notifications. This app is for those who enjoy the pure, simple joy of reading the bible, unencumbered.\n\nThe translation used is referred to as \"Amplified.\" This is currently my favorite version, as it lends itself towards truly understanding what the authors of the bible meant.\n\nThis app, like all the other free bible apps out there, is ad supported. The difference is, I promise never to interrupt the experience with full screen ads. So many other apps out there do, and it's really annoying (that's actually what led me to create this app). By downloading this app, you are helping to support an independent app developer, and a christian, to make a living.\n\nThank you for your support!"

      "label": "Upon passing an eye test and a written test, a beginner driver receives a G1 license where they can practice driving for 12 months. G1 license holders cannot have alcohol in their blood while they drive, cannot drive between 12 a.m. and 5 a.m., cannot drive on busy highways and expressways, and must be accompanied by a fully licensed and experienced driver.\r\n\r\nYour G1 test will be comprised of 40 multiple-choice questions, which are divided into two separate sections: rules of the road and road signs. You must answer a minimum of 16 questions in each section correctly to pass the written knowledge test. The written knowledge exam to get your G1 license in Ontario is based on the 2022 Driver’s Handbook. Exams are administered at your local DriveTest Centre, and you’ll need to complete an eye exam while you’re there before you may get your G1 license. Ontario uses a graduated driver’s license (GDL) program. Once you are 16, you may test for your G1, and then you must hold the license for a year, or eight months if you’re in a driver training program before you can take a driving test and get a G2 license; all in all, the licensing process takes about two years.\r\n\r\nIf you only study the official MTO manual, your chances of passing the written G1 test are only about 49 percent. The driver's handbook isn’t written to promote rapid learning. No matter how smart you are, it has a way to make you feel dumb: there are way too many things to remember all at once. \r\n\r\nYes, first of all, please keep faith in yourself.\r\n\r\nPast data tells us that 80% of people can pass on their first attempt, but this means that 20% of people will fail on their first attempt, but that's not terrible, and that's what this app can change.\r\n\r\nDo what we say and keep practising and at the end make sure you challenge yourself with the 'mock test' which will tell you if you can pass the official test and if you pass all the mock tests that means you will pass 100%!\r\n\r\nFirst, go through Flash Crad to quickly gain key knowledge.Then, go through the exercises to consolidate that knowledge.Finally, don't forget to review in time to correct all those questions that were answered incorrectly.\r\n\r\nUser Agreement:https://sites.google.com/view/aboutusterms/#h.i9glwqmrboht\r\nPrivacy Policy:https://sites.google.com/view/aboutusterms/#h.9za86w7hq91o\r\n\r\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Accounts will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the rate of the selected plan. Subscriptions and auto-renewal may be managed by going to Account Settings after purchase."

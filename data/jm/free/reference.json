Enter each word from your spelling list one by one until you’ve spelled all the words.\n\n• Fill in the blank\n\nEach of your spelling words has a letter missing. You must fill in the blank for each of your spelling words.\n\n• Word Scramble\n\nWe scrambled all the words in your spelling list. Rearrange the letters back into the correct order. \n\n• Word Search\n\nSpell It places words from your spelling list into your very own word search. Find every word in the word bank to complete the puzzle.\n\nSpell It allows you to add as many words to as many lists as you want. After you complete each challenge, you’ll see your results.

In the late 1990’s, David’s material first appeared on the Blue Letter Bible, and was found to be a valuable resource.\n\nDavid’s Bible resources – both in text and through audio and video – are used by many thousands of people every day. Many pastors, Bible teachers, and everyday Christians find these materials helpful.\n\nNow you can take the Enduring Word Commentary with you on your mobile device."

      "label": "SKY TONIGHT is a brand-new astronomical app for exploring the sky. It helps stargazers answer the three most common questions:\n\n⁕ What is that bright dot in the sky?\n⁕ What astronomical events can I see tonight?\n⁕ How can I find the object I'm interested in?\n\nMade by the developers of Star Walk apps, Sky Tonight is a customizable stargazing tool, that is designed for users with different needs and wants. You can adjust the constellation's appearance, set a reminder for any space body configuration, explore the unique relative to observer trajectory, set up a magnitude limit to filter out space objects, and much more.\n\nSKY TONIGHT FEATURES:\n\n► Point your device at the sky to see the real-time positions of space objects on the interactive sky map.\n► Activate the Time Machine and determine the position of celestial bodies at different time periods.\n► Use the augmented reality mode and see the sky map overlaid on the image from your device's camera.\n► Get extended information about any sky object by tapping on its name.\n► Stay updated on the latest news from the world of astronomy with the What's new section.\n► Turn on the night mode to make your sky observation in the nighttime more comfortable.\n► Filter the objects that appear on the sky map according to their visual brightness.\n► Regulate the brightness of objects on the sky map.\n► Spot dozens of asterisms along with the official constellations. \n► Adjust the visible constellations and customize their representation on the screen.\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES:\n\n◆ INTERACTIVE TRAJECTORIES RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER\nInstead of the classic trajectory that shows the object’s trajectory in the celestial sphere relative to the Earth’s center, the app presents the object’s trajectory in the sky relative to an observer. A long touch on the trajectories relative to the observer will move the sky object to the selected point. While holding the touch, move your finger along the trajectory to change the time.\n\n◆ FLEXIBLE SEARCH\nMake use of the flexible search — quickly find space objects, easily navigate across different objects and events’ types. Look for \"stars\", \"mars moons\", \"mars conjunctions\", \"solar eclipse\", and the app will show you all related objects, events, and articles!\nThere are also Trending and Recent categories in the search section. The first one presents the currently most popular objects, events, or news; the second category contains objects you recently selected. \n\n◆ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE EVENT REMINDERS\nSet event reminders on any time and date not to miss a solar eclipse, a Full Moon, or a star-planet configuration you're interested in.\n\n◆ ASTRONOMY CALENDAR WITH A STARGAZING INDEX AND WEATHER FORECAST\nCheck out the calendar of celestial events that includes lunar phases, meteor showers, eclipses, oppositions, conjunctions, and other exciting events. Learn what astronomy events will occur this month or see what happened in the sky a year ago!\nVerify the Stargazing Index calculated from a Moon phase, light pollution, cloudiness, and time when an object is visible. The higher this index is, the better the observation conditions are.\n\nYou don’t need several apps for your stargazing planning anymore; Sky Tonight contains all the info you need.\n\nPremium Access:\n\n* The app includes paid Premium Access. Get Premium Access to use Sky Tonight with no limits! Without the subscription, you can’t see most of the interface items in various sections such as Visible Tonight, Calendar, and Search. Therefore, you’re limited in planning and improving your observations. Premium Access will allow you to unlock all the interface items in any view and make the most of all the app’s features. Advertisements will also be removed not to interrupt your stargazing experience.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://vitotechnology.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://vitotechnology.com/terms-of-use"

The application is especially useful for learning the C# .NET programming language. You have to buy compilations inside the application. Internet connection is required.\n\n- The great programming tool on the AppStore.\n- Your programming language for iOS is amazing!\n\n* FEATURES *\n\n- Compile and run your program.\n- Text input before program run and text output.\n- Enhanced source code editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, color themes and additional keyboard.\n- Import and export programs by iTunes or by email.\n- Online language reference and several program samples.\n\n* LIMITATIONS *\n\n- Internet connection is required to compile and run a program.\n- Graphics, network, file system and real-time input are not supported.\n- Maximum running time of a program is 15 seconds.\n\nThanks for using the application!\n\n====================================\n\nC# (pronounced see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma and ISO. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure. \n\nC# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its development team leader is Anders Hejlsberg. The most recent version is C# 4.0, which was released on April 12, 2010. \n\nThe name \"C sharp\" was inspired by musical notation where a sharp indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch. This is similar to the language name of C++, where \"++\" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1. \n\nDue to technical limitations of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.) and the fact that the sharp symbol (# music sharp sign) is not present on the standard keyboard, the number sign was chosen to represent the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language. This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification. However, when it is practical to do so (for example, in advertising or in box art), Microsoft uses the intended musical symbol. \n\nThe \"sharp\" suffix has been used by a number of other .NET languages that are variants of existing languages, including J# (a .NET language also designed by Microsoft that is derived from Java 1.1), A# (from Ada), and the functional programming language F#. The original implementation of Eiffel for .NET was called Eiffel#, a name since retired since the full Eiffel language is now supported. The suffix has also been used for libraries, such as Gtk# (a .NET wrapper for GTK+ and other GNOME libraries), Cocoa# (a wrapper for Cocoa) and Qt# (a .NET language binding for the Qt toolkit)."

      "label": "SQL programming language for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch based on SQLite engine. Programming language is a perfect tool for studying, complex mathematical calculation, entertainment and many other useful tasks. The application is especially useful for learning the SQL programming language. You have to buy compilations inside the application. Internet connection is required.\n\n- The great programming tool on the AppStore.\n- Your programming language for iOS is amazing!\n\n* FEATURES *\n\n- Compile and run your program.\n- Text input before program run and text output.\n- Enhanced source code editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, color themes and additional keyboard.\n- Online language reference and several program samples.\n\n* LIMITATIONS *\n\n- Internet connection is required to compile and run a program.\n- Graphics, network, file system and real-time input are not supported.\n- Maximum running time of a program is 15 seconds.\n\nThanks for using the application! \n\n====================================\n\nSQL is a programming language designed for managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). \n\nOriginally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, its scope includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control. \n\nSQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F. Codd's relational model, as described in his influential 1970 paper, \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\". Despite not adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a declarative language, it also includes procedural elements. SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standards (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been enhanced several times with added features. However, issues of SQL code portability between major RDBMS products still exist due to lack of full compliance with, or different interpretations of, the standard. Among the reasons mentioned are the large size and incomplete specification of the standard, as well as vendor lock-in. \n\nSQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in the early 1970s. This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasi-relational database management system, System R, which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s. The acronym SEQUEL was later changed to SQL because \"SEQUEL\" was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley aircraft company. \n\nThe first Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) was RDMS, developed at MIT in the early 1970s, soon followed by Ingres, developed in 1974 at U.C. Berkeley. Ingres implemented a query language known as QUEL, which was later supplanted in the marketplace by SQL.\n\nAfter testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing commercial products based on their System R prototype including System/38, SQL/DS, and DB2, which were commercially available in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively."

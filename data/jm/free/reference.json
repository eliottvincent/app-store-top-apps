The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music.

Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

      "label": "Pleco is the ultimate Chinese learning companion: an integrated dictionary / document reader / flashcard system with fullscreen handwriting input and live OCR, from a company that's been making the world's best mobile Chinese learning apps since 2001.\n\nMajor features: ($ = paid add-on)\n\n• Amazing dictionaries. We offer two free built-in dictionaries: the popular open-source CC-CEDICT, with over 110,000 frequently-updated entries, and our own PLC dictionary, with 125,000 entries, parts of speech, and over 25,000 example sentences (with Pinyin). More than two dozen other dictionaries are available as free and paid ($) add-ons, including licensed titles from well-known publishers like Oxford, Longman, FLTRP, Tuttle, SLPH, and Commercial Press.\n\n• Powerful merged search: look up words by Chinese characters, Pinyin (spaces / tones optional), or English, with support for wildcards and full-text search. And no need to tediously flip between all of those dictionaries to find a word - just type in your search term and instantly get a combined, frequency-sorted result list.\n\n• Links and cross-references: easily look up character components, break down words into individual characters, look up lists of words containing a particular character, and search across all dictionaries for example sentences containing a word.\n\n• Gorgeous typography: see it for yourself in our screenshots - we think we're one of the best-looking Chinese dictionaries around. Alternate Kai/Song/Xing-style Chinese fonts are also available ($).\n\n• PRC/HK/Taiwan-friendly: every part of Pleco supports both traditional and simplified, headword readings can be shown in Pinyin and Zhuyin, and some dictionaries even support Cantonese. (note: stroke order diagrams do support traditional characters, but use PRC order)\n\n• Audio: Hear Mandarin and Cantonese for words and example sentences using iOS' free built-in text-to-speech system. We also offer add-ons ($) with native-speaker Mandarin recordings and higher-quality Mandarin TTS.\n\n• Document Reader: bring in text from the clipboard and tap on words in it to instantly look them up. Upgrade ($) adds support for tap-lookups in text, HTML, DOC, DOCX, PDF, and EPUB files. We also offer graded readings ($).\n\n• OCR: look up words simply by pointing your device's camera at them, or by tapping on them in a still image. ($)\n\n• Fullscreen handwriting: use your device's whole screen instead of just a little box. Extremely accurate and highly tolerant of stroke order mistakes. (enhanced $)\n\n• Flashcards: create a card from any dictionary entry with a single button tap, import premade word lists, use advanced memorization techniques like SRS, and study in a variety of modes including fill-in-the-blanks handwriting and tone drills. ($)\n\n• Stroke Order Diagrams: animations showing you how to draw each character; 500 characters for free, 28,000 in paid ($) version.\n\n• User dictionaries: create new dictionary entries right on your device as you encounter new words. ($)\n\n• No ads.\n\nWe also offer famously excellent customer support and an active user community at http://www.plecoforums.com. And we're constantly working to make our products better; our sales and customer base have been growing for two decades across 4 different platforms. You can be confident that we'll still be fixing bugs and adding features for years to come.\n\nPaid add-ons can be transferred to other devices that link to your iTunes account just like any other paid iTunes content; simply install our free app, open up the \"Add-ons\" screen, and tap on the \"Restore Purchases\" button to activate your purchase on each device.\n\nPlease contact us at support@pleco.com, via the form at http://www.pleco.com/contact.html, or using the in-app \"Contact Support\" command with any questions - we'll be delighted to hear from you."

      "label": "Upon passing an eye test and a written test, a beginner driver receives a G1 license where they can practice driving for 12 months. G1 license holders cannot have alcohol in their blood while they drive, cannot drive between 12 a.m. and 5 a.m., cannot drive on busy highways and expressways, and must be accompanied by a fully licensed and experienced driver.\r\n\r\nYour G1 test will be comprised of 40 multiple-choice questions, which are divided into two separate sections: rules of the road and road signs. You must answer a minimum of 16 questions in each section correctly to pass the written knowledge test. The written knowledge exam to get your G1 license in Ontario is based on the 2022 Driver’s Handbook. Exams are administered at your local DriveTest Centre, and you’ll need to complete an eye exam while you’re there before you may get your G1 license. Ontario uses a graduated driver’s license (GDL) program. Once you are 16, you may test for your G1, and then you must hold the license for a year, or eight months if you’re in a driver training program before you can take a driving test and get a G2 license; all in all, the licensing process takes about two years.\r\n\r\nIf you only study the official MTO manual, your chances of passing the written G1 test are only about 49 percent. The driver's handbook isn’t written to promote rapid learning. No matter how smart you are, it has a way to make you feel dumb: there are way too many things to remember all at once. \r\n\r\nYes, first of all, please keep faith in yourself.\r\n\r\nPast data tells us that 80% of people can pass on their first attempt, but this means that 20% of people will fail on their first attempt, but that's not terrible, and that's what this app can change.\r\n\r\nDo what we say and keep practising and at the end make sure you challenge yourself with the 'mock test' which will tell you if you can pass the official test and if you pass all the mock tests that means you will pass 100%!\r\n\r\nFirst, go through Flash Crad to quickly gain key knowledge.Then, go through the exercises to consolidate that knowledge.Finally, don't forget to review in time to correct all those questions that were answered incorrectly.\r\n\r\nUser Agreement:https://sites.google.com/view/aboutusterms/#h.i9glwqmrboht\r\nPrivacy Policy:https://sites.google.com/view/aboutusterms/#h.9za86w7hq91o\r\n\r\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "Listen to the Book of Enoch Human voice audio mp3 as well\nThe Book of Enoch, written during the second century B.C.E., is one of the most important non-canonical apocryphal works, and probably had a huge influence on early Christian, particularly Gnostic, beliefs. Filled with hallucinatory visions of heaven and hell, angels and devils, Enoch introduced concepts such as fallen angels, the appearance of a Messiah, Resurrection, a Final Judgement, and a Heavenly Kingdom on Earth. Interspersed with this material are quasi-scientific digressions on calendrical systems, geography, cosmology, astronomy, and meteorology. \n\n\nBiblical stories are often fantastical, unbelievable and sometimes confusing when it comes to interpreting their meaning. Of the apocryphal biblical texts, there are few more enigmatic and fascinating than the Book of Enoch, and in certain sects of Christianity these books are still part of the dominant biblical canon. But could clues from these texts provide evidence of a completely different story of our ancient ancestors, namely one involving visits from an advanced extraterrestrial race?"

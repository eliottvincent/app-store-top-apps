In the late 1990’s, David’s material first appeared on the Blue Letter Bible, and was found to be a valuable resource.\n\nDavid’s Bible resources – both in text and through audio and video – are used by many thousands of people every day. Many pastors, Bible teachers, and everyday Christians find these materials helpful.\n\nNow you can take the Enduring Word Commentary with you on your mobile device."

The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

Choose to dive deeper with our brand new podcast featuring believers all over the world sharing their insights from the word of the day.\n\n• Word of the Day:  Each day we share a meaningful word to lay the groundwork for the day's devotion.\n\n• Definition: We've heard some of these words countless times and sometimes, as a result they began to lose their meaning. We go back to the root definition to remind ourselves that words do have meaning.\n\n• Scripture: We believe \".. the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.\" (Hebrews 4:12-13). God's Word is living, active and shapes us. Reflect on Scripture that follows the theme of the day.\n\n• Practice: Devotionals are nothing without application. Our hope is that together we can become people of these words through practice and intentional living.\n\n• Prayer: Lastly, we share a prayer to guide us as we seek to become more like Jesus Christ.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n• Widgets\n• Custom Reminders\n• Save your Favorites"

      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App & #1 Prayer App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

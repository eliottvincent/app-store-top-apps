The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

      "label": "SKY TONIGHT is a brand-new astronomical app for exploring the sky. It helps stargazers answer the three most common questions:\n\n⁕ What is that bright dot in the sky?\n⁕ What astronomical events can I see tonight?\n⁕ How can I find the object I'm interested in?\n\nMade by the developers of Star Walk apps, Sky Tonight is a customizable stargazing tool, that is designed for users with different needs and wants. You can adjust the constellation's appearance, set a reminder for any space body configuration, explore the unique relative to observer trajectory, set up a magnitude limit to filter out space objects, and much more.\n\nSKY TONIGHT FEATURES:\n\n► Point your device at the sky to see the real-time positions of space objects on the interactive sky map.\n► Activate the Time Machine and determine the position of celestial bodies at different time periods.\n► Use the augmented reality mode and see the sky map overlaid on the image from your device's camera.\n► Get extended information about any sky object by tapping on its name.\n► Stay updated on the latest news from the world of astronomy with the What's new section.\n► Turn on the night mode to make your sky observation in the nighttime more comfortable.\n► Filter the objects that appear on the sky map according to their visual brightness.\n► Regulate the brightness of objects on the sky map.\n► Spot dozens of asterisms along with the official constellations. \n► Adjust the visible constellations and customize their representation on the screen.\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES:\n\n◆ INTERACTIVE TRAJECTORIES RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER\nInstead of the classic trajectory that shows the object’s trajectory in the celestial sphere relative to the Earth’s center, the app presents the object’s trajectory in the sky relative to an observer. A long touch on the trajectories relative to the observer will move the sky object to the selected point. While holding the touch, move your finger along the trajectory to change the time.\n\n◆ FLEXIBLE SEARCH\nMake use of the flexible search — quickly find space objects, easily navigate across different objects and events’ types. Look for \"stars\", \"mars moons\", \"mars conjunctions\", \"solar eclipse\", and the app will show you all related objects, events, and articles!\nThere are also Trending and Recent categories in the search section. The first one presents the currently most popular objects, events, or news; the second category contains objects you recently selected. \n\n◆ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE EVENT REMINDERS\nSet event reminders on any time and date not to miss a solar eclipse, a Full Moon, or a star-planet configuration you're interested in.\n\n◆ ASTRONOMY CALENDAR WITH A STARGAZING INDEX AND WEATHER FORECAST\nCheck out the calendar of celestial events that includes lunar phases, meteor showers, eclipses, oppositions, conjunctions, and other exciting events. Learn what astronomy events will occur this month or see what happened in the sky a year ago!\nVerify the Stargazing Index calculated from a Moon phase, light pollution, cloudiness, and time when an object is visible. The higher this index is, the better the observation conditions are.\n\nYou don’t need several apps for your stargazing planning anymore; Sky Tonight contains all the info you need.\n\nPremium Access:\n\n* The app includes paid Premium Access. Get Premium Access to use Sky Tonight with no limits! Without the subscription, you can’t see most of the interface items in various sections such as Visible Tonight, Calendar, and Search. Therefore, you’re limited in planning and improving your observations. Premium Access will allow you to unlock all the interface items in any view and make the most of all the app’s features. Advertisements will also be removed not to interrupt your stargazing experience.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://vitotechnology.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://vitotechnology.com/terms-of-use"

      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 1,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

A generation of students used Pascal as an introductory language in undergraduate courses. Variants of Pascal have also frequently been used for everything from research projects to PC games and embedded systems. Newer Pascal compilers exist which are widely used. \n\nPascal was the primary high-level language used for development in the Apple Lisa, and in the early years of the Mac. Parts of the original Macintosh operating system were hand-translated into Motorola 68000 assembly language from the Pascal sources. The popular typesetting system TeX by Donald E. Knuth was written in WEB, the original literate programming system, based on DEC PDP-10 Pascal, while an application like Total Commander was written in Delphi (Object Pascal). \n\nObject Pascal is still used for developing Windows applications. A cross-platform version called Free Pascal, with the Lazarus IDE, is popular with Linux users since it promises write once, compile anywhere, development."

      "label": "Upon passing an eye test and a written test, a beginner driver receives a G1 license where they can practice driving for 12 months. G1 license holders cannot have alcohol in their blood while they drive, cannot drive between 12 a.m. and 5 a.m., cannot drive on busy highways and expressways, and must be accompanied by a fully licensed and experienced driver.\r\n\r\nYour G1 test will be comprised of 40 multiple-choice questions, which are divided into two separate sections: rules of the road and road signs. You must answer a minimum of 16 questions in each section correctly to pass the written knowledge test. The written knowledge exam to get your G1 license in Ontario is based on the 2022 Driver’s Handbook. Exams are administered at your local DriveTest Centre, and you’ll need to complete an eye exam while you’re there before you may get your G1 license. Ontario uses a graduated driver’s license (GDL) program. Once you are 16, you may test for your G1, and then you must hold the license for a year, or eight months if you’re in a driver training program before you can take a driving test and get a G2 license; all in all, the licensing process takes about two years.\r\n\r\nIf you only study the official MTO manual, your chances of passing the written G1 test are only about 49 percent. The driver's handbook isn’t written to promote rapid learning. No matter how smart you are, it has a way to make you feel dumb: there are way too many things to remember all at once. \r\n\r\nYes, first of all, please keep faith in yourself.\r\n\r\nPast data tells us that 80% of people can pass on their first attempt, but this means that 20% of people will fail on their first attempt, but that's not terrible, and that's what this app can change.\r\n\r\nDo what we say and keep practising and at the end make sure you challenge yourself with the 'mock test' which will tell you if you can pass the official test and if you pass all the mock tests that means you will pass 100%!\r\n\r\nFirst, go through Flash Crad to quickly gain key knowledge.Then, go through the exercises to consolidate that knowledge.Finally, don't forget to review in time to correct all those questions that were answered incorrectly.\r\n\r\nUser Agreement:https://sites.google.com/view/aboutusterms/#h.i9glwqmrboht\r\nPrivacy Policy:https://sites.google.com/view/aboutusterms/#h.9za86w7hq91o\r\n\r\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

Pantone Connect streamlines the color inspiration to design process, making it easy for you to measure and match physical materials to Pantone Color, share your inspirational color palettes to social media, and navigate any updated Pantone Color System to find the perfect hue while on the go.  \n\nWhen paired with the Color Match Card from Pantone, the app calibrates your iOS device's camera for color measurement, and captured colors are quickly matched to their nearest Pantone Color more accurately than extracting color from a photo.  Be sure to check that your iOS device is compatible with Color Match Card before you order one.  While most device models are compatible, we are still in the process of adding some iOS devices to our list.\n\nThe app is part of the new Pantone Connect digital color platform for mobile, web, and Adobe Creative Cloud (Extension), meaning colors discovered while on the go can be easily applied to design files when you're back in your studio.  \n\nThe following features will remain free for everyone on mobile and web:\n - All Pantone Colors, always up to date\n - sRGB and Hex values for all colors\n - Measurement with the Pantone Color Match Card\n - Color extraction from images\n - Palette+image sharing to social media\n - Color library search, navigation, sorting, and filtering\n - Pantone system cross referencing (X-Ref)\n - Trending color palettes from Pantone\n\nPremium features for mobile and tablet are also currently free to use, and will include:\n - CMYK and L*a*b* values for all colors\n - Convert to Pantone from sRGB, Hex, L*a*b*, and CMYK values\n - Saving more than 1 palettes and team palette collaboration\n - Nuance color to nearby hues\n - Color harmonies\n\nAccounts:\nCurrently, Pantone Connect is completely free to use, including all Premium features, while we actively develop and improve this platform. Free accounts can be created in-app.  Premium accounts can be activated on Pantone's website.\n\nOther Pantone App Compatibility:\nPantone Connect accounts do not work with the Pantone Studio for iOS app or vice versa, and users who pay for Pantone Studio access will not receive access to Pantone Connect.\n\nLink to our End User License Agreement: https://www.pantone.com/connect/#/end-user-license-agreement\n\nLink to our Privacy Policy: https://www.pantone.com/about/terms-of-use\n\nNeed help?

      "label": "Pleco is the ultimate Chinese learning companion: an integrated dictionary / document reader / flashcard system with fullscreen handwriting input and live OCR, from a company that's been making the world's best mobile Chinese learning apps since 2001.\n\nMajor features: ($ = paid add-on)\n\n• Amazing dictionaries. We offer two free built-in dictionaries: the popular open-source CC-CEDICT, with over 110,000 frequently-updated entries, and our own PLC dictionary, with 125,000 entries, parts of speech, and over 25,000 example sentences (with Pinyin). More than two dozen other dictionaries are available as free and paid ($) add-ons, including licensed titles from well-known publishers like Oxford, Longman, FLTRP, Tuttle, SLPH, and Commercial Press.\n\n• Powerful merged search: look up words by Chinese characters, Pinyin (spaces / tones optional), or English, with support for wildcards and full-text search. And no need to tediously flip between all of those dictionaries to find a word - just type in your search term and instantly get a combined, frequency-sorted result list.\n\n• Links and cross-references: easily look up character components, break down words into individual characters, look up lists of words containing a particular character, and search across all dictionaries for example sentences containing a word.\n\n• Gorgeous typography: see it for yourself in our screenshots - we think we're one of the best-looking Chinese dictionaries around. Alternate Kai/Song/Xing-style Chinese fonts are also available ($).\n\n• PRC/HK/Taiwan-friendly: every part of Pleco supports both traditional and simplified, headword readings can be shown in Pinyin and Zhuyin, and some dictionaries even support Cantonese. (note: stroke order diagrams do support traditional characters, but use PRC order)\n\n• Audio: Hear Mandarin and Cantonese for words and example sentences using iOS' free built-in text-to-speech system. We also offer add-ons ($) with native-speaker Mandarin recordings and higher-quality Mandarin TTS.\n\n• Document Reader: bring in text from the clipboard and tap on words in it to instantly look them up. Upgrade ($) adds support for tap-lookups in text, HTML, DOC, DOCX, PDF, and EPUB files. We also offer graded readings ($).\n\n• OCR: look up words simply by pointing your device's camera at them, or by tapping on them in a still image. ($)\n\n• Fullscreen handwriting: use your device's whole screen instead of just a little box. Extremely accurate and highly tolerant of stroke order mistakes. (enhanced $)\n\n• Flashcards: create a card from any dictionary entry with a single button tap, import premade word lists, use advanced memorization techniques like SRS, and study in a variety of modes including fill-in-the-blanks handwriting and tone drills. ($)\n\n• Stroke Order Diagrams: animations showing you how to draw each character; 500 characters for free, 28,000 in paid ($) version.\n\n• User dictionaries: create new dictionary entries right on your device as you encounter new words. ($)\n\n• No ads.\n\nWe also offer famously excellent customer support and an active user community at http://www.plecoforums.com. And we're constantly working to make our products better; our sales and customer base have been growing for two decades across 4 different platforms. You can be confident that we'll still be fixing bugs and adding features for years to come.\n\nPaid add-ons can be transferred to other devices that link to your iTunes account just like any other paid iTunes content; simply install our free app, open up the \"Add-ons\" screen, and tap on the \"Restore Purchases\" button to activate your purchase on each device.\n\nPlease contact us at support@pleco.com, via the form at http://www.pleco.com/contact.html, or using the in-app \"Contact Support\" command with any questions - we'll be delighted to hear from you."

Programming language is a perfect tool for studying, complex mathematical calculation, entertainment and many other useful tasks. The application is especially useful for learning the Pascal programming language. You have to buy compilations inside the application. Internet connection is required.\n\n- The great programming tool on the AppStore.\n- Your programming language for iOS is amazing!\n\n* FEATURES *\n\n- Compile and run your program.\n- Text input before program run and text output.\n- Enhanced source code editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, color themes and additional keyboard.\n- Import and export programs by iTunes or by email.\n- Online language reference and several program samples.\n\n* LIMITATIONS *\n\n- Internet connection is required to compile and run a program.\n- Graphics, network, file system and real-time input are not supported.\n- Maximum running time of a program is 15 seconds.\n\nThanks for using the application!\n\n====================================\n\nPascal is an influential imperative and procedural programming language, designed in 1968/9 and published in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth as a small and efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring. \n\nA derivative known as Object Pascal designed for object-oriented programming was developed in 1985. \n\nPascal was developed by Niklaus Wirth and based on the ALGOL programming language, named in honor of the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal. \n\nPrior to his work on Pascal, Wirth had developed Euler and ALGOL W and later went on to develop the Pascal-like languages Modula-2 and Oberon. \n\nInitially, Pascal was largely, but not exclusively, intended to teach students structured programming. A generation of students used Pascal as an introductory language in undergraduate courses. Variants of Pascal have also frequently been used for everything from research projects to PC games and embedded systems. Newer Pascal compilers exist which are widely used. \n\nPascal was the primary high-level language used for development in the Apple Lisa, and in the early years of the Mac. Parts of the original Macintosh operating system were hand-translated into Motorola 68000 assembly language from the Pascal sources. The popular typesetting system TeX by Donald E. Knuth was written in WEB, the original literate programming system, based on DEC PDP-10 Pascal, while an application like Total Commander was written in Delphi (Object Pascal). \n\nObject Pascal is still used for developing Windows applications. A cross-platform version called Free Pascal, with the Lazarus IDE, is popular with Linux users since it promises write once, compile anywhere, development."

      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 1,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

You get the comfortable reading experience a print Bible can offer along with instant access to more meaningful content than you’ll find in any one study Bible or devotional Bible.\n\nAnd now, Filament also includes the opportunity to build your daily Bible reading habit with the new reading plans feature, designed to give you a simple list of the pages you need to read to keep on track with your Bible reading goals, whether it is to read through the entire Bible or just to get a sense for what the Bible says about a key topic.\n\nOur prayer is that Filament will be a faithful companion as you engage with God through the Bible!"

Programming language is a perfect tool for studying, complex mathematical calculation, entertainment and many other useful tasks. The application is especially useful for learning the C programming language. You have to buy compilations inside the application. Internet connection is required.\n\n- The great programming tool on the AppStore.\n- Your programming language for iOS is amazing!\n\n* FEATURES *\n\n- Compile and run your program.\n- Text input before program run and text output.\n- Enhanced source code editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, color themes and additional keyboard.\n- Online language reference and several program samples.\n\n* LIMITATIONS *\n\n- Internet connection is required to compile and run a program.\n- Graphics, network, file system and real-time input are not supported.\n- Maximum running time of a program is 15 seconds.\n\nLook for the \"C++ Programming Language\" on the AppStore too. Thanks for using the application! \n\n====================================\n\nC (pronounced like the letter C) is a general-purpose computer programming language developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the Unix operating system.\n\nAlthough C was designed for implementing system software, it is also widely used for developing portable application software.\n\nC is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time and there are very few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not exist. C has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably C++, which began as an extension to C.\n\nC is an imperative (procedural) systems implementation language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. C was therefore useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language.\n\nDespite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.\n\nThe initial development of C occurred at Bell Labs between 1969 and 1973; according to Ritchie, the most creative period occurred in 1972. It was named \"C\" because its features were derived from an earlier language called \"B\", which according to Ken Thompson was a stripped-down version of the BCPL programming language.\n\nThe origin of C is closely tied to the development of the Unix operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a PDP-7 by Ritchie and Thompson, incorporating several ideas from colleagues. Eventually they decided to port the operating system to a PDP-11.\n\nThe original PDP-11 version of the Unix system was developed in assembly language. By 1973, with the addition of struct types, the C language had become powerful enough that most of the Unix kernel was rewritten in C. This was one of the first operating system kernels implemented in a language other than assembly.\n\nIn 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language. This book, known to C programmers as \"K&R\", served for many years as an informal specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as K&R C. The second edition of the book covers the later ANSI C standard."

      "label": "Listen to the Book of Enoch Human voice audio mp3 as well\nThe Book of Enoch, written during the second century B.C.E., is one of the most important non-canonical apocryphal works, and probably had a huge influence on early Christian, particularly Gnostic, beliefs. Filled with hallucinatory visions of heaven and hell, angels and devils, Enoch introduced concepts such as fallen angels, the appearance of a Messiah, Resurrection, a Final Judgement, and a Heavenly Kingdom on Earth. Interspersed with this material are quasi-scientific digressions on calendrical systems, geography, cosmology, astronomy, and meteorology. \n\n\nBiblical stories are often fantastical, unbelievable and sometimes confusing when it comes to interpreting their meaning. Of the apocryphal biblical texts, there are few more enigmatic and fascinating than the Book of Enoch, and in certain sects of Christianity these books are still part of the dominant biblical canon. But could clues from these texts provide evidence of a completely different story of our ancient ancestors, namely one involving visits from an advanced extraterrestrial race?"

Absolutely not take you to the labyrinth of chapters to achieve Sonic Dahs but you can take it easy with independent modular style with these helpful contents for Sonic Dash. It’s certainly that you can finish Sonic Dash with smart and effectively. This is a strongly recommended app. Because This is FREE a guide for Sonic Dash 2 for how to play and get unlimited Rings and goblins Now we have collected the best tips and tricks easy no cheats for Sonic Dash 2.\n\nLike its predecessor, Sonic Dash 2 is an eternal chase against Dr Eggman (Hey, if you think that fat old dude can’t book it, try and catch him at the very end of the original Sonic the Hedgehog sometime). Sonic is the first to run after Baldy, but you can gradually unlock his friends: Knuckles, Tails, Amy, and Sticks, a jungle badger introduced in Rise of Lyric.\n\nYou run automatically, and can switch lanes by swiping your device’s screen. Swiping up or down causes you to roll, an attack that disposes of enemies in your way. Each character also has special abilities that helps them deal with the challenges they face on the racetrack. There are tons of hazards to deal with here, including pits, electric traps, and, uh, trees. Man, to hell with trees.\n\nOccasionally, Sonic Dash 2 lets you explore off the beaten path and engage challenging tracks that are particularly narrow and enemy-filled. These diversions can yield a lot of rewards, and they’re also a good time to employ “Sprites,” living power-ups that enhance your character permanently or temporarily as long as they’re equipped.\n\nAn amusing thing about Sonic Dash 2 is that it’s fast, fun, and features a steady frame-rate — all stuff that Rise of Lyric failed miserably at. There aren’t a lot of new ideas on display, which is probably something we all expect from endless running games at this point in time.\n\nOn the other hand, Rise of Lyric tried to bring a whole bunch of new ideas to the Sonic universe, and we all know how that worked out. Sonic Dash 2 prioritizes ideas and mechanics that worked in the original Sonic Dash, and that’s probably the best thing it could do.\n\nSonic Dash 2: Sonic Boom is a fun endless running game that’s tightly-bound. It proves, once again, that Sonic is at his best when he’s just allowed to run free with the wind in his quills.\n\nBesides, you will have experienced with Sonic Dash in vivid and color lists of instruction along with the path of Sonic Dash success. Since it does not require any prerequisites, you can keep up your progress in Sonic Dash whatever you like. The app supports all mobile platforms. Let’s check it out. Get access dashing games free to latest tips, tricks, and cheats & more! if you are very interesting to Sonic Dash 2, then this is the perfect game guide app for you.\n\n**** DISCLAIMER: ****\nLegal Notices:\nThis app is an unofficial Sonic Dash guide only, it is not authorized or created by the creator of the game.\nThis application complies with US Copyright law guidelines of \"fair use\".

      "label": "SKY TONIGHT is a brand-new astronomical app for exploring the sky. It helps stargazers answer the three most common questions:\n\n⁕ What is that bright dot in the sky?\n⁕ What astronomical events can I see tonight?\n⁕ How can I find the object I'm interested in?\n\nMade by the developers of Star Walk apps, Sky Tonight is a customizable stargazing tool, that is designed for users with different needs and wants. You can adjust the constellation's appearance, set a reminder for any space body configuration, explore the unique relative to observer trajectory, set up a magnitude limit to filter out space objects, and much more.\n\nSKY TONIGHT FEATURES:\n\n► Point your device at the sky to see the real-time positions of space objects on the interactive sky map.\n► Activate the Time Machine and determine the position of celestial bodies at different time periods.\n► Use the augmented reality mode and see the sky map overlaid on the image from your device's camera.\n► Get extended information about any sky object by tapping on its name.\n► Stay updated on the latest news from the world of astronomy with the What's new section.\n► Turn on the night mode to make your sky observation in the nighttime more comfortable.\n► Filter the objects that appear on the sky map according to their visual brightness.\n► Regulate the brightness of objects on the sky map.\n► Spot dozens of asterisms along with the official constellations. \n► Adjust the visible constellations and customize their representation on the screen.\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES:\n\n◆ INTERACTIVE TRAJECTORIES RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER\nInstead of the classic trajectory that shows the object’s trajectory in the celestial sphere relative to the Earth’s center, the app presents the object’s trajectory in the sky relative to an observer. A long touch on the trajectories relative to the observer will move the sky object to the selected point. While holding the touch, move your finger along the trajectory to change the time.\n\n◆ FLEXIBLE SEARCH\nMake use of the flexible search — quickly find space objects, easily navigate across different objects and events’ types. Look for \"stars\", \"mars moons\", \"mars conjunctions\", \"solar eclipse\", and the app will show you all related objects, events, and articles!\nThere are also Trending and Recent categories in the search section. The first one presents the currently most popular objects, events, or news; the second category contains objects you recently selected. \n\n◆ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE EVENT REMINDERS\nSet event reminders on any time and date not to miss a solar eclipse, a Full Moon, or a star-planet configuration you're interested in.\n\n◆ ASTRONOMY CALENDAR WITH A STARGAZING INDEX AND WEATHER FORECAST\nCheck out the calendar of celestial events that includes lunar phases, meteor showers, eclipses, oppositions, conjunctions, and other exciting events. Learn what astronomy events will occur this month or see what happened in the sky a year ago!\nVerify the Stargazing Index calculated from a Moon phase, light pollution, cloudiness, and time when an object is visible. The higher this index is, the better the observation conditions are.\n\nYou don’t need several apps for your stargazing planning anymore; Sky Tonight contains all the info you need.\n\nPremium Access:\n\n* The app includes paid Premium Access. Get Premium Access to use Sky Tonight with no limits! Without the subscription, you can’t see most of the interface items in various sections such as Visible Tonight, Calendar, and Search. Therefore, you’re limited in planning and improving your observations. Premium Access will allow you to unlock all the interface items in any view and make the most of all the app’s features. Advertisements will also be removed not to interrupt your stargazing experience.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://vitotechnology.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://vitotechnology.com/terms-of-use"

      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

In the late 1990’s, David’s material first appeared on the Blue Letter Bible, and was found to be a valuable resource.\n\nDavid’s Bible resources – both in text and through audio and video – are used by many thousands of people every day. Many pastors, Bible teachers, and everyday Christians find these materials helpful.\n\nNow you can take the Enduring Word Commentary with you on your mobile device."

In addition to the dominant features such as reading the Qur'an and listening to the Qur'an, there are many different details in the application. You can use translations in different languages, tafsir, book mode and dozens of other features.\n\nThe application, which contains all the features to increase your Quran reading experience, contains all the details you may want.\n\nQuran 360: Quran English, Quran Audio, Tafsir, Recitation\n\nReading \nListening \nFamous Reciters\nDifferent Reading Modes\nSearch Feature\nAyah Sharing\nTafsir\nTranslations in Different Languages\nDaily Ayahs\nBookmark\nTransliteration\nCustomizable Font Size\nIncrease Listening Speed\n\nRead Quran English\n\nThose who want to read our holy book on their phones may encounter many difficulties. The inability to adjust the font sizes, eye-catching designs and other details negatively affect the reading experience.\n\n360, on the other hand, is getting ready to take its place in the stores to eliminate all these difficulties. It promises a more fluid experience thanks to its features such as different reading modes, font size adjustment, and background changing.\n\nThe feature of bookmarking where you left off during the reading process is among the most requested features. In this way, even if you exit the application, you can see where you left off when you return.\n\nQuran Audio Mode\n\nThe most popular aspect of the Quran Audio listening feature is that it includes different reciters. As you know, recitation is practiced as an art in itself. Especially in Arabic-speaking countries, there are schools and courses on recetitation. You can listen to every ayah you want from the voices of famous reciters in 360. If you want, you can also listen to the whole book from beginning to end.\n\nThanks to the option to increase the speed of reading the Qur'an, you have the chance to quickly recite the entire book. You can also use this feature when you want to skip the ayahs you have memorized.\n\nFamous Reciters\n\nBesides reading our holy book, it is also a good deed to listen to it. Quran 360 brings this worship to your smartphones.\n\nIt provides all the conveniences you want for reading from start to finish, that is, hateem it by listening. In this way, you can listen and read the Qur'an at home, at work, on the road or wherever you want.\n\nThe application includes famous reciters from all over the world. You can listen to ayahs with recordings of well-known reciters such as Akram Al-Alaqmi, Abdul Rashid Sufi, Abdul Muhsin al Qasim, Abdullah Mahrood.\n\nThe recording of Akram Al-Alaqmi is prepared without a gap. Thus, you can listen to the whole قران كريم without interruption.\n\nQuran Tafsir\n\nUnderstanding the Qur'an is as important as reading it. For this reason, many Islamic scholars have published tafsir books. Tafsir means translation with explanation.\n\nIf you read the Qur'an together with the Tafsir books, you can see the real meanings and other details behind the ayahs. Moreover, you can see why that verse was revealed or after which event it was conveyed to the Hz. Muhammad (s.a.v.).\n\nThe application's search mode also makes it easy to find the verse details you want. Thus, without searching the internet, you can search by all verses and the words in the verses by just using the application.\n\nQuran Translations\n\nContaining more than 30 قران كريم translations, the app allows you to see transliteration, translation and tafsir in the language you want.\n\nThe application includes translations of many languages ​​such as English, Turkish, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Malay, Indonesian, Hindi, Urdu, Persian, Bulgarian, Swedish, Italian.\n\nPrivacy & Terms : https://www.muslimassistant.com/privacy-terms.html"

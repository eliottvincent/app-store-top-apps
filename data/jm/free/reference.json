Copy the text you can't understand and TransKey will show you what it means in your native language!\n\n―\nHOW DOES IT WORK\n\nWrite what you'd like to say, but before sending your message, tap and hold the Globe key to switch to TransKey. After selecting a target language, tap \"Translate text\" and watch your message get translated right in the app! \n\nIf you'd like to translate a message you received, tap and hold it until an option to \"Copy\" appears. In TransKey tap \"Translate copy\", and the translation will appear in the same place!\n\n―\n\nNever encounter another language barrier again when communicating with people in other countries! TransKey provides a flawless translation experience right in the messaging app of your choice unlike other translators which interrupt the flow by forcing you to switch to another app.\n\nUnlike other translator keyboards, TransKey does not have a keyboard for typing. This allows you to use the keyboard you're most comfortable with, such as the iOS or Swype keyboards.\n\n―\n\nBefore TransKey:\n1. Type your message\n2. Copy the message\n3. Exit the app you're currently using\n4. Open a translation app\n5. Paste your message\n6. Translate the message\n7. Copy the translated message\n8. Exit the translation app\n9. Open the chat app\n10. Paste the translated message\n\nAfter TransKey:\n1. Type what you need to translate\n2. Switch to TransKey\n3. Tap translate\n\n―\nFEATURES\n\n• Translate the last sentence of any text field directly within any app\n• Translate received messages directly within any app\n• Fast and accurate translation to and from over 100 languages\n• Automatic detection of source language\n• Copy the translation to be used anywhere\n• Optimized for all iPhone screen sizes in both portrait and landscape\n• Preserves capitalization and emojis\n\n―\n\nI built TransKey by myself, so if you enjoy the app please tell your friends about it, write a review on the App Store, or send me your thoughts through the app. I'd greatly appreciate it! \n\n―\nNOTICES\n\nFor accurate real-time translations, TransKey relies on industry leading machine-translation engines such as Google Translate and Yandex Translator. \n\nFull access is needed to communicate with the translator, the keyboard cannot function otherwise. We do not get access to everything you write, only the last sentence of the text field in focus when you are using TransKey. We do not store or keep a record of anything you translate, please read our Privacy Policy for further information.\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://transkey.alekapps.xyz/terms.pdf\nPrivacy Policy: https://transkey.alekapps.xyz/privacy.pdf\n\nTransKey is entirely free to use up to 180 characters per day with Yandex Translate. For a small monthly fee you can upgrade to TransKey Premium, with unlimited high-quality translations using Google Translate. Subscriptions will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes Account and renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the period. You will not be able to cancel a subscription during the active period. You can manage your subscriptions in your Account Settings after purchase.\n\n―\nCONTACT ME\n\nAny questions, comments, or concerns? I'd love to hear them!

The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

      "label": "The authoritative Caller ID reverse lookup app. Our app has provided reliable, free caller name ID since 2013 and amassed nearly 20,000 positive reviews. We are the only phone directory that has patented our advanced, transparent search technology assuring you updated and accurate information. \n\nMajor version release 2.0 brings an entirely redesigned interface incorporating innovative suggestions from our users.  If somebody called you or contacted you via social media and you're trying to find out who owns the number, use our app to quickly do a \"reverse lookup\" and determine who called you. \n\nNew features in Version 2.0:\n-Global Caller ID now allows search of over 1 billion phone numbers worldwide! Our free version covers ~60% of numbers - the best free service available. \n\n-Maps Geolocation shows approximate area by area code.\n\n-All new Social Media directory to publish your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and email addresses in our phone directory!\n\n-Crowdsourced voting and comments on SPAM numbers, prank callers, telemarketers, etc.\n\n-Dialing format and timezone gives you all the information you need on foreign / international contacts.\n\n\nMost (if not all) cellular phone carriers do not offer the full caller ID service that exists for landline phones. When someone calls a mobile phone, the cell phone caller ID leaves out the name, only showing the phone number and/or city of the caller. Real caller ID shows the number & name of the caller. Since 2013, Greenflight has offered this invaluable free & real caller ID utility for the iOS architecture.\n\nThis tool may only be used to research phone numbers that called you or contacted you via social media. All use must comply with applicable international, federal, and local laws. The Caller-ID service is not a consumer reporting agency as by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n\nFor Caller ID Pro Edition subscriptions, a free trial three day trial is available for first time users.  After the free trial finishes, premium membership for up to 30 searches/month is available for $9.49 a month. \n\nPayment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase, or end of trial period, if applicable. Subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\n• Terms of Service: https://www.okcaller.com/tos.php\n• Privacy Policy: https://www.okcaller.com/privacy.php\nOur data is derived from transparent and open processes specified Greenflight owned USPTO patents and/or reissues."

      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

Theses texts are processed with powerful \"big data\" algorithms and machine learning to provide you the best results. \r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by context? The search results (translation) of a specific word or expression are weaved within real-life sentences, so you will be sure to understand and learn exactly how the word can be used, and make no embarrassing mistakes.  \r\n\r\nJust type or say the word or expression you wish to translate and the results will appear instantly:  relevant translations, presented with examples of how words are used in sentences.\r\n\r\nThe app offers flashcards and quizzes based on your search history and favorites to help you memorize them and to improve your language skills. Unlike standard learning tools, it focuses on words and expressions that you really need and want to learn.\r\n\r\nThe bits and bytes: \r\n* Instantly translate selected text when reading content on your browser, iBook or any other app, with no need to exit the app you are using. Click on the familiar \"Share\" option and select the Reverso option. \r\n* Translation in 14 languages: Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Polish, Dutch, Arabic, Russian, Romanian, Japanese, Turkish, Hebrew and Chinese and we are working on more. \r\n* Advanced features include pronunciation, history, phrasebook of your favorites and more.\r\n* Create vocabulary lists based on your personal selection of examples and translations. Lists remain available even when you’re offline. \r\n* Enjoy natural pronunciation of complete example sentences.\r\n* One click to get translations, frequency details, and  conjugation when applicable.\r\n* Search history, also available offline.\r\n* Suggestions: words and expressions will be suggested to you as you type.\r\n* Share your findings via email or social media.\r\n\r\nAuto-renewable subscription terms:\r\nChoose a subscription that fits your needs:\r\n- Monthly subscription (with a 7-day free trial) for €3.99 EUR;\r\n- Annual subscription for €29.99 EUR;\r\nThese prices corresponds to the same price tier that \"Apple's App Store Matrix\" determines in other currencies.\r\nPlease note:\r\n-Your free trial subscription will automatically renew to a paid subscription unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial period. \r\n-Any unused portion of a free trial period (if offered) will be forfeited when a premium subscription is purchased during the free trial period.\r\nThe free trial or the subscription can be canceled anytime by turning off auto-renewal in the iTunes account settings. This must be done 24 hours before the end of a free trial or subscription period to avoid being charged. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free version.\r\nPrivacy policy:\r\nhttp://www.reverso.net/privacy_app.aspx?lang=EN\r\nTerms of use:\r\nhttp://www.reverso.net/disclaimer.aspx?lang=EN\r\n\r\n* Join us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reverso.net and follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.reverso.net/ReversoEN to discover new content, languages and features.\r\n* Visit our website: http://context.reverso.net/"

In the late 1990’s, David’s material first appeared on the Blue Letter Bible, and was found to be a valuable resource.\n\nDavid’s Bible resources – both in text and through audio and video – are used by many thousands of people every day. Many pastors, Bible teachers, and everyday Christians find these materials helpful.\n\nNow you can take the Enduring Word Commentary with you on your mobile device."

      "label": "The new Python 3 programming language for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. Programming language is a perfect tool for studying, complex mathematical calculation, entertainment and many other useful tasks. The application is especially useful for learning the Python 3 programming language. You have to buy compilations inside the application. Internet connection is required.\n\n- The great programming tool on the AppStore.\n- Your programming language for iOS is amazing!\n\n* FEATURES *\n\n- Compile and run your program.\n- Text input before program run and text output.\n- Enhanced source code editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, color themes and additional keyboard.\n- Online language reference and several program samples.\n\n* LIMITATIONS *\n\n- Internet connection is required to compile and run a program.\n- Graphics, network, file system and real-time input are not supported. \n- Maximum running time of a program is 15 seconds.\n\nLook for the \"Python 2 Programming Language\" too. Thanks for using the application! \n\n======================================\n\nPython is a general-purpose, high-level programming language whose design philosophy emphasizes code readability. Python's syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C, and the language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of Scheme, Ruby, Perl and Tclm and has a large and comprehensive standard library.\n\nLike other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.\n\nCPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.\n\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the A-B-C language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).\n\nPython 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features including a full garbage collector and support for Unicode. With this release the development process was changed and became more transparent and community-backed.\n\nPython 3.0 (also called Python 3000 or py3k), a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on 3 December 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7."

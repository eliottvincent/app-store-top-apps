In the late 1990’s, David’s material first appeared on the Blue Letter Bible, and was found to be a valuable resource.\n\nDavid’s Bible resources – both in text and through audio and video – are used by many thousands of people every day. Many pastors, Bible teachers, and everyday Christians find these materials helpful.\n\nNow you can take the Enduring Word Commentary with you on your mobile device."

      "label": "Unleash the power of your smartphone to take you on a guided tour of the night sky, even if you’ve never used a telescope before.\n\nSTARSENSE SKY RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY\n\nThis one-of-a-kind app uses patent-pending technology in combination with a Celestron StarSense Explorer telescope (sold separately) to analyze star patterns overhead to calculate the telescope’s position in real time with pinpoint accuracy.\nStarSense Explorer’s sky recognition technology has revolutionized the manual telescope by eliminating the confusion common among beginners and enhancing the user experience for even seasoned telescope users. Many would-be astronomers become frustrated or lose interest in their manual telescope because they don’t know where to point it to see planets, star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies—the good stuff! StarSense Explorer tells you exactly which celestial objects are currently visible in the night sky and where to move your telescope to place those objects in the telescope’s eyepiece. \n\nTHE NIGHT SKY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nThe user-friendly planetarium interface allows you to scan the skies for objects you wish to view. You can also search for objects in the extensive database. \nNot sure what to observe? StarSense Explorer automatically generates a list of all the best stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and more currently visible from your location. Simply select one from the list and off you go! \nWhile you observe, you can access detailed information, images, and audio descriptions for the most popular objects. It’s a great way for the entire family to learn scientific facts, history, mythology, and more, deepening your understanding of the night sky.\n\nEASY AS 1-2-3: DOCK, LAUNCH, OBSERVE\n\nTo get started, assemble your StarSense Explorer telescope and download the app. Your telescope includes a unique unlock code to access the full features of the app. Connect your phone to the telescope by placing it into the StarSense dock and launch the app.\nAfter a simple 2-step procedure to align the smartphone’s camera with the telescope, the app displays a view of the night sky and shows a bullseye on the screen to represent the telescope’s current pointing position. From here, you can select an object to view by tapping it in the planetarium view or selecting it from the Tonight’s Best observing list. Objects will vary from night to night; you may see planets like Jupiter or Saturn, nebulae like Orion, the Andromeda Galaxy, or other object types.\nOnce you select an object, the app displays pointing arrows onscreen. These indicate where to move the telescope to find it. Follow the arrows until the bullseye appears centered on target. When the bullseye turns green, the object is visible in the telescope’s lower powered eyepiece. \n\nHOW STARSENSE EXPLORER WORKS\n\nStarSense Explorer uses image data captured by the smartphone’s camera to determine its pointing position. The app captures an image of the night sky and then matches the star patterns within the image to its internal database in a process like fingerprint matching or facial recognition. \nThe process of extracting star pattern data in images to determine a telescope’s current pointing position is called “plate solving.” It is the same method used by professional observatories and orbiting satellites. \nThe StarSense Explorer app is the first app ever developed that uses plate solving to determine the smartphone’s current pointing position. Other astronomy apps rely on the smartphone’s gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compass to estimate its pointing position. These methods are not accurate enough to place objects within the telescope’s field of view. \nStarSense Explorer technology is patent-pending. \n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nCompatible with iPhone 6 and higher.\n\nLOCALIZATION\n\nSupport for English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Japanese and Russian."

Filled with hallucinatory visions of heaven and hell, angels and devils, Enoch introduced concepts such as fallen angels, the appearance of a Messiah, Resurrection, a Final Judgement, and a Heavenly Kingdom on Earth. Interspersed with this material are quasi-scientific digressions on calendrical systems, geography, cosmology, astronomy, and meteorology. \n\n\nBiblical stories are often fantastical, unbelievable and sometimes confusing when it comes to interpreting their meaning. Of the apocryphal biblical texts, there are few more enigmatic and fascinating than the Book of Enoch, and in certain sects of Christianity these books are still part of the dominant biblical canon. But could clues from these texts provide evidence of a completely different story of our ancient ancestors, namely one involving visits from an advanced extraterrestrial race?"

      "label": "Discover the world of spiritual numbers.\n\nSpiritual numbers are short sequences of numbers that are repeated often or that stand out for you in a very clear way.\n\nDiscovering the meaning of numbers and the secret symbolism and synchronicity they possess can aid your self-discovery and spiritual awakening.\n\nEvery number expresses a connection to universal principles. Numbers are everywhere and people develop strong connections with them for a variety of reasons.\n\nBelieve it or not, seeing angel numbers is one of the most commonly experienced signs from the angelic realm.\n\nAngel Numbers are a way for your Angels to communicate with you. They are a means to send specific coded messages to you by your Angels in the form of number sequences. Numbers are a universal language, therefore; the Angels try to communicate with you using them letting us know of their presence.  \n\nLearn the combinations of numbers or the karmic number and its meaning.\n\nThis may sound surprising, but the truth of the matter is that Angelic guidance and assistance does not always appear as expected. The Angels and numbers are interlinked and interconnected. The Angel guides us through our thoughts and emotions.\n\nOne of the most common and exciting ways that our angels send their guidance and wisdom is through the use of angel numbers. Angel numbers are sequences of numbers that carry divine guidance by referring to specific numerological meanings. \n\nIn Numerology, the divine science of numbers, it is understood that each number carries with it a specific vibrational meaning that goes beyond a simple quantity."

We are the only phone directory that has patented our advanced, transparent search technology assuring you updated and accurate information. \n\nMajor version release 2.0 brings an entirely redesigned interface incorporating innovative suggestions from our users.  If somebody called you or contacted you via social media and you're trying to find out who owns the number, use our app to quickly do a \"reverse lookup\" and determine who called you. \n\nNew features in Version 2.0:\n-Global Caller ID now allows search of over 1 billion phone numbers worldwide! Our free version covers ~60% of numbers - the best free service available. \n\n-Maps Geolocation shows approximate area by area code.\n\n-All new Social Media directory to publish your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and email addresses in our phone directory!\n\n-Crowdsourced voting and comments on SPAM numbers, prank callers, telemarketers, etc.\n\n-Dialing format and timezone gives you all the information you need on foreign / international contacts.\n\n\nMost (if not all) cellular phone carriers do not offer the full caller ID service that exists for landline phones. When someone calls a mobile phone, the cell phone caller ID leaves out the name, only showing the phone number and/or city of the caller. Real caller ID shows the number & name of the caller. Since 2013, Greenflight has offered this invaluable free & real caller ID utility for the iOS architecture.\n\nThis tool may only be used to research phone numbers that called you or contacted you via social media. All use must comply with applicable international, federal, and local laws. The Caller-ID service is not a consumer reporting agency as by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n\nFor Caller ID Pro Edition subscriptions, a free trial three day trial is available for first time users.  After the free trial finishes, premium membership for up to 30 searches/month is available for $9.49 a month. \n\nPayment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase, or end of trial period, if applicable. Subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

      "label": "\"Incredible App - My sister shared this app with me a few weeks ago and it is truly incredible. The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

      "label": "Unleash the power of your smartphone to take you on a guided tour of the night sky, even if you’ve never used a telescope before.\n\nSTARSENSE SKY RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY\n\nThis one-of-a-kind app uses patent-pending technology in combination with a Celestron StarSense Explorer telescope (sold separately) to analyze star patterns overhead to calculate the telescope’s position in real time with pinpoint accuracy.\nStarSense Explorer’s sky recognition technology has revolutionized the manual telescope by eliminating the confusion common among beginners and enhancing the user experience for even seasoned telescope users. Many would-be astronomers become frustrated or lose interest in their manual telescope because they don’t know where to point it to see planets, star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies—the good stuff! StarSense Explorer tells you exactly which celestial objects are currently visible in the night sky and where to move your telescope to place those objects in the telescope’s eyepiece. \n\nTHE NIGHT SKY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nThe user-friendly planetarium interface allows you to scan the skies for objects you wish to view. You can also search for objects in the extensive database. \nNot sure what to observe? StarSense Explorer automatically generates a list of all the best stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and more currently visible from your location. Simply select one from the list and off you go! \nWhile you observe, you can access detailed information, images, and audio descriptions for the most popular objects. It’s a great way for the entire family to learn scientific facts, history, mythology, and more, deepening your understanding of the night sky.\n\nEASY AS 1-2-3: DOCK, LAUNCH, OBSERVE\n\nTo get started, assemble your StarSense Explorer telescope and download the app. Your telescope includes a unique unlock code to access the full features of the app. Connect your phone to the telescope by placing it into the StarSense dock and launch the app.\nAfter a simple 2-step procedure to align the smartphone’s camera with the telescope, the app displays a view of the night sky and shows a bullseye on the screen to represent the telescope’s current pointing position. From here, you can select an object to view by tapping it in the planetarium view or selecting it from the Tonight’s Best observing list. Objects will vary from night to night; you may see planets like Jupiter or Saturn, nebulae like Orion, the Andromeda Galaxy, or other object types.\nOnce you select an object, the app displays pointing arrows onscreen. These indicate where to move the telescope to find it. Follow the arrows until the bullseye appears centered on target. When the bullseye turns green, the object is visible in the telescope’s lower powered eyepiece. \n\nHOW STARSENSE EXPLORER WORKS\n\nStarSense Explorer uses image data captured by the smartphone’s camera to determine its pointing position. The app captures an image of the night sky and then matches the star patterns within the image to its internal database in a process like fingerprint matching or facial recognition. \nThe process of extracting star pattern data in images to determine a telescope’s current pointing position is called “plate solving.” It is the same method used by professional observatories and orbiting satellites. \nThe StarSense Explorer app is the first app ever developed that uses plate solving to determine the smartphone’s current pointing position. Other astronomy apps rely on the smartphone’s gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compass to estimate its pointing position. These methods are not accurate enough to place objects within the telescope’s field of view. \nStarSense Explorer technology is patent-pending. \n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nCompatible with iPhone 6 and higher.\n\nLOCALIZATION\n\nSupport for English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Japanese and Russian."

      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

Absolutely not take you to the labyrinth of chapters to achieve Sonic Dahs but you can take it easy with independent modular style with these helpful contents for Sonic Dash. It’s certainly that you can finish Sonic Dash with smart and effectively. This is a strongly recommended app. Because This is FREE a guide for Sonic Dash 2 for how to play and get unlimited Rings and goblins Now we have collected the best tips and tricks easy no cheats for Sonic Dash 2.\n\nLike its predecessor, Sonic Dash 2 is an eternal chase against Dr Eggman (Hey, if you think that fat old dude can’t book it, try and catch him at the very end of the original Sonic the Hedgehog sometime). Sonic is the first to run after Baldy, but you can gradually unlock his friends: Knuckles, Tails, Amy, and Sticks, a jungle badger introduced in Rise of Lyric.\n\nYou run automatically, and can switch lanes by swiping your device’s screen. Swiping up or down causes you to roll, an attack that disposes of enemies in your way. Each character also has special abilities that helps them deal with the challenges they face on the racetrack. There are tons of hazards to deal with here, including pits, electric traps, and, uh, trees. Man, to hell with trees.\n\nOccasionally, Sonic Dash 2 lets you explore off the beaten path and engage challenging tracks that are particularly narrow and enemy-filled. These diversions can yield a lot of rewards, and they’re also a good time to employ “Sprites,” living power-ups that enhance your character permanently or temporarily as long as they’re equipped.\n\nAn amusing thing about Sonic Dash 2 is that it’s fast, fun, and features a steady frame-rate — all stuff that Rise of Lyric failed miserably at. There aren’t a lot of new ideas on display, which is probably something we all expect from endless running games at this point in time.\n\nOn the other hand, Rise of Lyric tried to bring a whole bunch of new ideas to the Sonic universe, and we all know how that worked out. Sonic Dash 2 prioritizes ideas and mechanics that worked in the original Sonic Dash, and that’s probably the best thing it could do.\n\nSonic Dash 2: Sonic Boom is a fun endless running game that’s tightly-bound. It proves, once again, that Sonic is at his best when he’s just allowed to run free with the wind in his quills.\n\nBesides, you will have experienced with Sonic Dash in vivid and color lists of instruction along with the path of Sonic Dash success. Since it does not require any prerequisites, you can keep up your progress in Sonic Dash whatever you like. The app supports all mobile platforms. Let’s check it out.

      "label": "Pillars is a new app built by Muslims with a long-term vision to elevate our Ummah – starting with Prayer (salah). We have so much more planned! Join us on this journey.\n\nFeatures:\n\nNo Ads – adverts don’t belong on a Prayer app. Period. That’s why our app includes no ads straight out of the box.\n\nPrivacy-Focussed – Muslims are entitled to their privacy. That's why at Pillars we take your data very seriously. Not only do we promise not to collect it for malicious intent, we avoid collecting it in the first place!\n\nMuslim-Built – prayer apps should be built by Muslims. Why? Because we have your interests at heart and know the importance of Salah. We also best understand the issues Muslims face.\n\nEarly & Late Asr Time – choose your Madhab (School of Thought) and tailor your prayer times to the earlier or later Asr time.\n\nMultiple Calculation Methods – choose the perfect Prayer calculation method for you depending on your location and preferences. \n\nPrayer Notifications – get notified for each prayer time throughout the day. Option to disable notifications available.\n\nBeautiful Design – we want to beautify the act of Prayer, a key ibadah (act of worship) in Islam. Therefore, what better place to start than with an elegant prayer app.\n\nWidget Included – a beautifully designed widget for your home screen for quick access to prayer times\n\nPrayer Tracker – a great way to stay on top of your salah and the first step to developing your relationship with Allah. Perfect for new converts or those trying to improve their praying habits!\n\nMenstruation (pause) button - pause tracking and never miss out on a streak!\n\n\nComing Soon:\n\nLocal Mosque Prayer Times – get prayer times from your local mosque on the Pillars app, including notifications.\n\nFasting Tracker – easily mark days where you missed fasting and days that have been made up.\n\nMore Widgets – more beautifully designed widgets in all shapes & sizes.\n\nAt Pillars we're building features to help Muslims improve their individual condition in multiple aspects of their lives - from the spiritual to the non-spiritual.\n\nDownload the app and join us on this journey inshaAllah."

      "label": "This bible app strives for simplicity. All navigation is easy to find and accessible at the top of the screen and at the end of chapter, so you can quickly move around. It doesn't have any complicated features, and it doesn't send you push notifications. This app is for those who enjoy the pure, simple joy of reading the bible, unencumbered.\n\nThe translation used is New International. This is one of the versions that I, and many others, grew up with, and strikes a balance between the solemnity and power of the original older versions, and the understandability of a modern translation.\n\nThis app, like all the other free bible apps out there, is ad supported. The difference is, I promise never to interrupt the experience with full screen ads. So many other apps out there do, and it's really annoying (that's actually what led me to create this app). By downloading this app, you are helping to support an independent app developer, and a christian, to make a living.\n\nThank you for your support!"

In the late 1990’s, David’s material first appeared on the Blue Letter Bible, and was found to be a valuable resource.\n\nDavid’s Bible resources – both in text and through audio and video – are used by many thousands of people every day.

      "label": "\"Incredible App - My sister shared this app with me a few weeks ago and it is truly incredible. The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

Sometimes the best way to start is to keep it simple.\n\nPractice Devo is a completely free, ad-free, simple, easy, 365 daily devotional for both men and women, designed to capture our hearts and minds for a few moments of our busy day. Choose to dive deeper with our brand new podcast featuring believers all over the world sharing their insights from the word of the day.\n\n• Word of the Day:  Each day we share a meaningful word to lay the groundwork for the day's devotion.\n\n• Definition: We've heard some of these words countless times and sometimes, as a result they began to lose their meaning. We go back to the root definition to remind ourselves that words do have meaning.\n\n• Scripture: We believe \".. the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.\" (Hebrews 4:12-13). God's Word is living, active and shapes us. Reflect on Scripture that follows the theme of the day.\n\n• Practice: Devotionals are nothing without application. Our hope is that together we can become people of these words through practice and intentional living.\n\n• Prayer: Lastly, we share a prayer to guide us as we seek to become more like Jesus Christ.\n\nFeatures include:\n\n• Widgets\n• Custom Reminders\n• Save your Favorites"

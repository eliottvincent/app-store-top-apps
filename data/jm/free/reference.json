      "label": "SKY TONIGHT is a brand-new astronomical app for exploring the sky. It helps stargazers answer the three most common questions:\n\n⁕ What is that bright dot in the sky?\n⁕ What astronomical events can I see tonight?\n⁕ How can I find the object I'm interested in?\n\nMade by the developers of Star Walk apps, Sky Tonight is a customizable stargazing tool, that is designed for users with different needs and wants. You can adjust the constellation's appearance, set a reminder for any space body configuration, explore the unique relative to observer trajectory, set up a magnitude limit to filter out space objects, and much more.\n\nSKY TONIGHT FEATURES:\n\n► Point your device at the sky to see the real-time positions of space objects on the interactive sky map.\n► Activate the Time Machine and determine the position of celestial bodies at different time periods.\n► Use the augmented reality mode and see the sky map overlaid on the image from your device's camera.\n► Get extended information about any sky object by tapping on its name.\n► Stay updated on the latest news from the world of astronomy with the What's new section.\n► Turn on the night mode to make your sky observation in the nighttime more comfortable.\n► Filter the objects that appear on the sky map according to their visual brightness.\n► Regulate the brightness of objects on the sky map.\n► Spot dozens of asterisms along with the official constellations. \n► Adjust the visible constellations and customize their representation on the screen.\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES:\n\n◆ INTERACTIVE TRAJECTORIES RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER\nInstead of the classic trajectory that shows the object’s trajectory in the celestial sphere relative to the Earth’s center, the app presents the object’s trajectory in the sky relative to an observer. A long touch on the trajectories relative to the observer will move the sky object to the selected point. While holding the touch, move your finger along the trajectory to change the time.\n\n◆ FLEXIBLE SEARCH\nMake use of the flexible search — quickly find space objects, easily navigate across different objects and events’ types. Look for \"stars\", \"mars moons\", \"mars conjunctions\", \"solar eclipse\", and the app will show you all related objects, events, and articles!\nThere are also Trending and Recent categories in the search section. The first one presents the currently most popular objects, events, or news; the second category contains objects you recently selected. \n\n◆ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE EVENT REMINDERS\nSet event reminders on any time and date not to miss a solar eclipse, a Full Moon, or a star-planet configuration you're interested in.\n\n◆ ASTRONOMY CALENDAR WITH A STARGAZING INDEX AND WEATHER FORECAST\nCheck out the calendar of celestial events that includes lunar phases, meteor showers, eclipses, oppositions, conjunctions, and other exciting events. Learn what astronomy events will occur this month or see what happened in the sky a year ago!\nVerify the Stargazing Index calculated from a Moon phase, light pollution, cloudiness, and time when an object is visible. The higher this index is, the better the observation conditions are.\n\nYou don’t need several apps for your stargazing planning anymore; Sky Tonight contains all the info you need.\n\nPremium Access:\n\n* The app includes paid Premium Access. Get Premium Access to use Sky Tonight with no limits! Without the subscription, you can’t see most of the interface items in various sections such as Visible Tonight, Calendar, and Search. Therefore, you’re limited in planning and improving your observations. Premium Access will allow you to unlock all the interface items in any view and make the most of all the app’s features. Advertisements will also be removed not to interrupt your stargazing experience.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://vitotechnology.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://vitotechnology.com/terms-of-use"

      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

      "label": "Listen to the Book of Enoch Human voice audio mp3 as well\nThe Book of Enoch, written during the second century B.C.E., is one of the most important non-canonical apocryphal works, and probably had a huge influence on early Christian, particularly Gnostic, beliefs. Filled with hallucinatory visions of heaven and hell, angels and devils, Enoch introduced concepts such as fallen angels, the appearance of a Messiah, Resurrection, a Final Judgement, and a Heavenly Kingdom on Earth. Interspersed with this material are quasi-scientific digressions on calendrical systems, geography, cosmology, astronomy, and meteorology. \n\n\nBiblical stories are often fantastical, unbelievable and sometimes confusing when it comes to interpreting their meaning. Of the apocryphal biblical texts, there are few more enigmatic and fascinating than the Book of Enoch, and in certain sects of Christianity these books are still part of the dominant biblical canon. But could clues from these texts provide evidence of a completely different story of our ancient ancestors, namely one involving visits from an advanced extraterrestrial race?"

      "label": "The classic Pascal programming language for iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. Programming language is a perfect tool for studying, complex mathematical calculation, entertainment and many other useful tasks. The application is especially useful for learning the Pascal programming language. You have to buy compilations inside the application. Internet connection is required.\n\n- The great programming tool on the AppStore.\n- Your programming language for iOS is amazing!\n\n* FEATURES *\n\n- Compile and run your program.\n- Text input before program run and text output.\n- Enhanced source code editor with syntax highlighting, line numbers, color themes and additional keyboard.\n- Import and export programs by iTunes or by email.\n- Online language reference and several program samples.\n\n* LIMITATIONS *\n\n- Internet connection is required to compile and run a program.\n- Graphics, network, file system and real-time input are not supported.\n- Maximum running time of a program is 15 seconds.\n\nThanks for using the application!\n\n====================================\n\nPascal is an influential imperative and procedural programming language, designed in 1968/9 and published in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth as a small and efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring. \n\nA derivative known as Object Pascal designed for object-oriented programming was developed in 1985. \n\nPascal was developed by Niklaus Wirth and based on the ALGOL programming language, named in honor of the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal. \n\nPrior to his work on Pascal, Wirth had developed Euler and ALGOL W and later went on to develop the Pascal-like languages Modula-2 and Oberon. \n\nInitially, Pascal was largely, but not exclusively, intended to teach students structured programming. A generation of students used Pascal as an introductory language in undergraduate courses. Variants of Pascal have also frequently been used for everything from research projects to PC games and embedded systems. Newer Pascal compilers exist which are widely used. \n\nPascal was the primary high-level language used for development in the Apple Lisa, and in the early years of the Mac. Parts of the original Macintosh operating system were hand-translated into Motorola 68000 assembly language from the Pascal sources. The popular typesetting system TeX by Donald E. Knuth was written in WEB, the original literate programming system, based on DEC PDP-10 Pascal, while an application like Total Commander was written in Delphi (Object Pascal). \n\nObject Pascal is still used for developing Windows applications. A cross-platform version called Free Pascal, with the Lazarus IDE, is popular with Linux users since it promises write once, compile anywhere, development."

Don't worry! No matter where you are, with Minipedia you'll have a whole encyclopedia right at your fingertips.\n\nMinipedia works offline and provides access to complete article texts, formulas and, of course, tables!\n\n*Important:* You must have access to wireless local area network (WiFi) for downloading databases.\n\n## Most Viewed Articles\nDon't waste your precious space on your mobile device for non-relevant articles. Minipedia provides offline access for the most important ones.\nMinipedia, with a database of articles much smaller than the entire online Wikipedia, provides intelligent searching based on the popularity of the article.\n\n## Math Formulas and Tables included!\nVery few Wiki Readers have the capability of correctly displaying math formulas, nor do they include Wikipedia tables (the images and fact summary in a column on the right edge of a Wikipedia web page). This feature can also be a great time saver, as users can quickly extract the necessary information from the table, rather than reading the article.\n\nUnfortunately, images are not included in minipedia. They simply take up to much space on your device.\n\n## Search as you Type!\nSearching for articles is extremely fast. Right when you type the first letter, you will see the first matches!\n\nSearch Wikipedia articles the Intelligent Way:\nFor example, a search for \"Mark\" on Wikipedia returns \"Marketing\" as the first item in the drop-down results list. A search for \"Mark\" on Minipedia returns \"Mark Zuckerberg\" as the top result, a more relevant answer for most users. Minipedia's intelligent search returns both results that begin with and results that contain \"Mark,\" (e.g., Mark Zuckerberg, Mark Wahlberg, Denmark, Affiliate Marketing, Marketing, Mark Twain, Mark Hamill, Mark Ruffalo, and Trademark).

Morrison \n\n       George Herbert Morrison has been characterized as one of the century's great \"pastor-preachers,\" always seeking to meet life's need with a word from God.\n\n       Morrison's preaching reflected his deep concern for the individual person through simplicity of language, certainty of word choice, confident assertion of Scripture, and careful poetic phrasing.\n\n       This same high regard for his audience appeared in his loving presentation of the truth no matter how controversial the issue, in the absence of contempt for others in his sermons, in his attempts to lead his listeners from their own interests to a broader perception of Christian concern."

There is no option to turn off the English translation. \n\nRecitation and translation of all suras are downloaded as you finish each surah.   You can multitask (do other things) while listening to the recitation as the app support background audio.\n\nPlease let us know any issues you see with the App so that we can prepare a better version of the App.\n\nImportant Note:\n------------\nIn its natural language (Arabic), the Quran is the direct Word of Allah (God) to mankind through the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nArabic is a very rich language, and words have many shades of meaning. While the text of the original Arabic Quran is identical and unchanged since its revelation, you will find various translations and interpretations. Anytime a translation is done into another language, the translator has to interpret the meaning and render it in the new language, which of course has different rules of grammar. It is, by nature, an approximation of the meaning, since words and ideas cannot be expressed identically in different languages. Any translation of the Quran no longer retains that 'official' and perfect status, however it can be tremendously helpful to people wanting to learn more about Islam.\n\nWe would strongly encourage those who want to learn about Islam to also read a scholarly written commentary of Quran (tafseer). A tafseer references to reasons behind a verse, to sayings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) (hadith) and to acts of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) (sunnah).\n------------"

Theses texts are processed with powerful \"big data\" algorithms and machine learning to provide you the best results. \r\n\r\nWhat do we mean by context? The search results (translation) of a specific word or expression are weaved within real-life sentences, so you will be sure to understand and learn exactly how the word can be used, and make no embarrassing mistakes.  \r\n\r\nJust type or say the word or expression you wish to translate and the results will appear instantly:  relevant translations, presented with examples of how words are used in sentences.\r\n\r\nThe app offers flashcards and quizzes based on your search history and favorites to help you memorize them and to improve your language skills. Unlike standard learning tools, it focuses on words and expressions that you really need and want to learn.\r\n\r\nThe bits and bytes: \r\n* Instantly translate selected text when reading content on your browser, iBook or any other app, with no need to exit the app you are using. Click on the familiar \"Share\" option and select the Reverso option. \r\n* Translation in 14 languages: Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Polish, Dutch, Arabic, Russian, Romanian, Japanese, Turkish, Hebrew and Chinese and we are working on more. \r\n* Advanced features include pronunciation, history, phrasebook of your favorites and more.\r\n* Create vocabulary lists based on your personal selection of examples and translations. Lists remain available even when you’re offline. \r\n* Enjoy natural pronunciation of complete example sentences.\r\n* One click to get translations, frequency details, and  conjugation when applicable.\r\n* Search history, also available offline.\r\n* Suggestions: words and expressions will be suggested to you as you type.\r\n* Share your findings via email or social media.\r\n\r\nAuto-renewable subscription terms:\r\nChoose a subscription that fits your needs:\r\n- Monthly subscription (with a 7-day free trial) for €3.99 EUR;\r\n- Annual subscription for €29.99 EUR;\r\nThese prices corresponds to the same price tier that \"Apple's App Store Matrix\" determines in other currencies.\r\nPlease note:\r\n-Your free trial subscription will automatically renew to a paid subscription unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial period. \r\n-Any unused portion of a free trial period (if offered) will be forfeited when a premium subscription is purchased during the free trial period.\r\nThe free trial or the subscription can be canceled anytime by turning off auto-renewal in the iTunes account settings. This must be done 24 hours before the end of a free trial or subscription period to avoid being charged. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free version.\r\nPrivacy policy:\r\nhttp://www.reverso.net/privacy_app.aspx?lang=EN\r\nTerms of use:\r\nhttp://www.reverso.net/disclaimer.aspx?lang=EN\r\n\r\n* Join us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reverso.net and follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.reverso.net/ReversoEN to discover new content, languages and features.\r\n* Visit our website: http://context.reverso.net/"

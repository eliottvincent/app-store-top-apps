The music that plays when you read the verses, the scrolling like flipping a page, and everything about it just makes my time with God feel very intimate when I am reading daily verses and able to go through some of the devotionals. Really grateful to have had this app shared with me, especially during everything going on right now, it couldn’t have been better timing. We have also shared it with our Dad who loves the app as well. I have used apps in the past such as the Bible app that is very well known and found that some of the devotionals included someone’s biased opinion instead of focusing on what God is saying to us in the Bible. This app and the Jesus Calling App are the only apps for Devotionals and Daily verses that I consistently use because I love them so much and deeply appreciate that they stick to what the Bible says and not someone’s own interpretation of it. Whoever designed this app did an incredible job! Thank you so much!\"\n\nReceive God's word daily through beautiful Holy Bible stories, verses, and music. Receive personal, relevant verses for inspiration and sharing with loved ones.  Each day a new verse is sent to your device - it's like receiving a message from a dear friend who loves you and wants you to be happy.  Join the #Bible movement, share the Word, and fill social media with grace.\n\nYou may use this app for free, but if you would be delighted to support our mission of delivering thousands of moments of grace, love, and wisdom each day, there are patronage subscriptions available. \n\nTerms of service: http://www.mindblownapp.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: http://www.mindblownapp.com/privacy"

Morrison \n\n       George Herbert Morrison has been characterized as one of the century's great \"pastor-preachers,\" always seeking to meet life's need with a word from God.\n\n       Morrison's preaching reflected his deep concern for the individual person through simplicity of language, certainty of word choice, confident assertion of Scripture, and careful poetic phrasing.\n\n       This same high regard for his audience appeared in his loving presentation of the truth no matter how controversial the issue, in the absence of contempt for others in his sermons, in his attempts to lead his listeners from their own interests to a broader perception of Christian concern."

There is no option to turn off the English translation. \n\nRecitation and translation of all suras are downloaded as you finish each surah.   You can multitask (do other things) while listening to the recitation as the app support background audio.\n\nPlease let us know any issues you see with the App so that we can prepare a better version of the App.\n\nImportant Note:\n------------\nIn its natural language (Arabic), the Quran is the direct Word of Allah (God) to mankind through the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nArabic is a very rich language, and words have many shades of meaning. While the text of the original Arabic Quran is identical and unchanged since its revelation, you will find various translations and interpretations. Anytime a translation is done into another language, the translator has to interpret the meaning and render it in the new language, which of course has different rules of grammar. It is, by nature, an approximation of the meaning, since words and ideas cannot be expressed identically in different languages. Any translation of the Quran no longer retains that 'official' and perfect status, however it can be tremendously helpful to people wanting to learn more about Islam.\n\nWe would strongly encourage those who want to learn about Islam to also read a scholarly written commentary of Quran (tafseer). A tafseer references to reasons behind a verse, to sayings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) (hadith) and to acts of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) (sunnah).\n------------"

      "label": "** The #1 Catholic App **\n\nWHAT IS HALLOW\nHallow is a Catholic prayer app that offers audio-guided meditation sessions to help us grow in our faith & spiritual lives and find peace in God. Explore over 6,000 different sessions on contemplative prayer, meditation, Catholic Bible readings, music, and more.\n\nIn today’s world, we’re stressed, anxious, distracted, & can’t sleep. At the same time, we’re searching for deeper meaning, purpose, & relationships. We believe these two challenges can be addressed with the same solution: peace in Jesus. In the end, after all, a halo in heaven is the goal :)\n\nWHAT YOU GET\n* Daily prayers: Pray daily across methods including 3 of our most popular - Lectio Divina (on the Daily Readings), the Rosary, & the Divine Mercy Chaplet\n* Christian Meditation: This can seem similar to mindfulness meditation in learning to be comfortable in silence, but the difference is the goal is never to remain in ourselves, but always to lift our hearts & minds to God, to talk with Him, listen to Him, & recognize His presence with us\n* Sleep Bible Stories: Try Night Prayer from Liturgy of the Hours / Daily Office, and Catholic Bible stories read by folks like Jonathan Roumie from the Chosen or Fr. Mike Schmitz from the New American Bible\n* Rosary: Meditate with Mary through the mysteries of the Catholic Rosary and other devotionals\n* Ignatian Examen: Reflect on your day & discover an awareness of God, Jesus Christ, & the Holy Spirit\n* Lectio Divina: Enter into a conversation with God through Bible passages / Scripture\n* Taizé & Gregorian Chant: Meditative chant & music\n* Community: Match your prayers to the season with the #pray40 Lent Challenge, starting Ash Wednesday, or our #pray25 Advent Challenge for Christmas\n* Homilies & Guests: From Father Mike Schmitz, and on topics on being a Catholic Dad, St. Augustine & more!\n* Praylists: Sessions on joy, humility, discernment, or stress / anxiety / calm\n* Challenges: Re-discover the Our Father, Stations of the Cross, Psalms, and Saints - or start with the Intro 9 Day Novena\n* Litanies & Novenas: Try out the Litany of Humility, the 54 Day Novena, and more!\n* Minute Meditations: Jesus, I Trust in You, Angelus, Rosary Decade, St. Michael the Archangel prayer and more!\n\nAdditional features to help customize your prayer experience:\n* Journal after every prayer\n* Choice of man or woman guide\n* Options for 3 different lengths for every prayer (typically 5, 10, or 15 minutes)\n* Ability to set prayer reminders\n* Option to include calming background music like Gregorian Chant\n* Ability to download sessions for offline listening\n* Ability to join a Hallow Family to share prayer intentions and prayer reflections with one another\n\nAs Hallow is a Catholic App (#1 among Catholic Apps), the content is developed by experienced Catholic theology and spirituality guides and reviewed by senior leaders within the Church (e.g., PhD’s, professors, Bishops, authors) and based on content from the approved Catholic Bible. We were also featured on EWTN. While it can be a beautiful app for Catholic men and women, it is meant as a resource for people of all faiths & religions.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING AND TERMS\nUsers can access our daily prayers (including the rosary) and the 9-day Intro Prayer Challenge for free.\nTo access the full suite of Hallow, Hallow offers two auto-renewing subscription options:\n$8.99 per month\n$59.99 per year\n\nThese prices are for United States customers.\n\nYour Hallow subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can go to your Apple account settings to manage your subscription and turn off auto-renew. Your account will be charged when the purchase is confirmed. Hallow also integrates with the Apple Health app to sync mindfulness minutes.\nTerms and conditions: https://hallow.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://hallow.com/privacy-policy"

      "label": "SKY TONIGHT is a brand-new astronomical app for exploring the sky. It helps stargazers answer the three most common questions:\n\n⁕ What is that bright dot in the sky?\n⁕ What astronomical events can I see tonight?\n⁕ How can I find the object I'm interested in?\n\nMade by the developers of Star Walk apps, Sky Tonight is a customizable stargazing tool, that is designed for users with different needs and wants. You can adjust the constellation's appearance, set a reminder for any space body configuration, explore the unique relative to observer trajectory, set up a magnitude limit to filter out space objects, and much more.\n\nSKY TONIGHT FEATURES:\n\n► Point your device at the sky to see the real-time positions of space objects on the interactive sky map.\n► Activate the Time Machine and determine the position of celestial bodies at different time periods.\n► Use the augmented reality mode and see the sky map overlaid on the image from your device's camera.\n► Get extended information about any sky object by tapping on its name.\n► Stay updated on the latest news from the world of astronomy with the What's new section.\n► Turn on the night mode to make your sky observation in the nighttime more comfortable.\n► Filter the objects that appear on the sky map according to their visual brightness.\n► Regulate the brightness of objects on the sky map.\n► Spot dozens of asterisms along with the official constellations. \n► Adjust the visible constellations and customize their representation on the screen.\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES:\n\n◆ INTERACTIVE TRAJECTORIES RELATIVE TO AN OBSERVER\nInstead of the classic trajectory that shows the object’s trajectory in the celestial sphere relative to the Earth’s center, the app presents the object’s trajectory in the sky relative to an observer. A long touch on the trajectories relative to the observer will move the sky object to the selected point. While holding the touch, move your finger along the trajectory to change the time.\n\n◆ FLEXIBLE SEARCH\nMake use of the flexible search — quickly find space objects, easily navigate across different objects and events’ types. Look for \"stars\", \"mars moons\", \"mars conjunctions\", \"solar eclipse\", and the app will show you all related objects, events, and articles!\nThere are also Trending and Recent categories in the search section. The first one presents the currently most popular objects, events, or news; the second category contains objects you recently selected. \n\n◆ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE EVENT REMINDERS\nSet event reminders on any time and date not to miss a solar eclipse, a Full Moon, or a star-planet configuration you're interested in.\n\n◆ ASTRONOMY CALENDAR WITH A STARGAZING INDEX AND WEATHER FORECAST\nCheck out the calendar of celestial events that includes lunar phases, meteor showers, eclipses, oppositions, conjunctions, and other exciting events. Learn what astronomy events will occur this month or see what happened in the sky a year ago!\nVerify the Stargazing Index calculated from a Moon phase, light pollution, cloudiness, and time when an object is visible. The higher this index is, the better the observation conditions are.\n\nYou don’t need several apps for your stargazing planning anymore; Sky Tonight contains all the info you need.\n\nPremium Access:\n\n* The app includes paid Premium Access. Get Premium Access to use Sky Tonight with no limits! Without the subscription, you can’t see most of the interface items in various sections such as Visible Tonight, Calendar, and Search. Therefore, you’re limited in planning and improving your observations. Premium Access will allow you to unlock all the interface items in any view and make the most of all the app’s features. Advertisements will also be removed not to interrupt your stargazing experience.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://vitotechnology.com/privacy-policy\nTerms of use: https://vitotechnology.com/terms-of-use"

TransKey translates your messages in real-time within any app from the keyboard!\n\nTransKey is the leading chat translator trusted by over 300,000 users and featured on sites like CNET, Product Hunt, Addictive Tips, and more!\n\nOver 10,000 5-star App Store reviews! \n\"I didn't think something like this was possible, but I'm happy to say I've been proven wrong. This is a great app to have on your iPhone!\"\n\n―\nWHAT IS IT\n\nTransKey is a keyboard extension that translates your messages inside any app (such as WhatsApp, iMessage, Facebook, Email, and many more).\n\nTransKey also works the other way around. Copy the text you can't understand and TransKey will show you what it means in your native language!\n\n―\nHOW DOES IT WORK\n\nWrite what you'd like to say, but before sending your message, tap and hold the Globe key to switch to TransKey. After selecting a target language, tap \"Translate text\" and watch your message get translated right in the app! \n\nIf you'd like to translate a message you received, tap and hold it until an option to \"Copy\" appears. In TransKey tap \"Translate copy\", and the translation will appear in the same place!\n\n―\n\nNever encounter another language barrier again when communicating with people in other countries! TransKey provides a flawless translation experience right in the messaging app of your choice unlike other translators which interrupt the flow by forcing you to switch to another app.\n\nUnlike other translator keyboards, TransKey does not have a keyboard for typing. This allows you to use the keyboard you're most comfortable with, such as the iOS or Swype keyboards.\n\n―\n\nBefore TransKey:\n1. Type your message\n2. Copy the message\n3. Exit the app you're currently using\n4. Open a translation app\n5. Paste your message\n6. Translate the message\n7. Copy the translated message\n8. Exit the translation app\n9. Open the chat app\n10. Paste the translated message\n\nAfter TransKey:\n1. Type what you need to translate\n2. Switch to TransKey\n3. Tap translate\n\n―\nFEATURES\n\n• Translate the last sentence of any text field directly within any app\n• Translate received messages directly within any app\n• Fast and accurate translation to and from over 100 languages\n• Automatic detection of source language\n• Copy the translation to be used anywhere\n• Optimized for all iPhone screen sizes in both portrait and landscape\n• Preserves capitalization and emojis\n\n―\n\nI built TransKey by myself, so if you enjoy the app please tell your friends about it, write a review on the App Store, or send me your thoughts through the app. I'd greatly appreciate it! \n\n―\nNOTICES\n\nFor accurate real-time translations, TransKey relies on industry leading machine-translation engines such as Google Translate and Yandex Translator. \n\nFull access is needed to communicate with the translator, the keyboard cannot function otherwise. We do not get access to everything you write, only the last sentence of the text field in focus when you are using TransKey. We do not store or keep a record of anything you translate, please read our Privacy Policy for further information.\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://transkey.alekapps.xyz/terms.pdf\nPrivacy Policy: https://transkey.alekapps.xyz/privacy.pdf\n\nTransKey is entirely free to use up to 180 characters per day with Yandex Translate. For a small monthly fee you can upgrade to TransKey Premium, with unlimited high-quality translations using Google Translate. Subscriptions will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes Account and renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the period. You will not be able to cancel a subscription during the active period. You can manage your subscriptions in your Account Settings after purchase.\n\n―\nCONTACT ME\n\nAny questions, comments, or concerns? I'd love to hear them!

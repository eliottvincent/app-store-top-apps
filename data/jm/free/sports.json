Replays of otherwise hidden areas in the field can be carried out, even if they were not at the focus of attention during the event itself.\n\nUsers are able to stream the event live, or capture it with the camera head and view it after the event has finished. They can broadcast and share their own events via this mobile app, or the web.\n\nUsers can choose to see any portion of the event they want, using CSports's App. The App cannot broadcast anything that you did not capture with CSports's proprietary camera head in the first place."

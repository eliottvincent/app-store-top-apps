The arbitrage profit percentage is also displayed!\n5) If you enter whole numbers in the “Wager Amount?” field, the calculator will automatically update you with how much you have to bet on each event to lock in your guaranteed profits. \n\nA few notes.\nDecimal takes decimals EG “3.5” and “.25”\nMoney Line takes positive and negative numbers EG “300” and  “-150”\nFractional takes fractions containing the “/“ symbol EG “2/5” and “45/21”\n\nThe best arbitrage opportunities usually occur when odds makers first release the odds. Remember, this is free money because there is no risk. These opportunities usually don’t last long! Stay sharp and good luck!\n\nIf you have questions, suggestions or you found a bug please visit pulcer.net and fill out the contact form.\n\nI am working on a premium release that has new features including a future’s based arbitrage calculator.

      "label": "Hey guys. Throughout my career in baseball, whether it was with the Rangers, Padres, Red Sox, Dodgers and Mets, I have always enjoyed the interaction with fans.  As social media took over the landscape, I found it harder and harder to stay connected as people have so many streams of content coming at them.  I thought for a long time that there must be a better way to connect with fans.\n \n​So, I went out and figured out a way to meet this challenge.  Titan23 is the best way to stay connected with me.  I’ve created the Titan23 App so that we can stay connected in a different way than before.  I’ve made it easy for you to keep up with my social media (its all here in one place).  I’ve made it easy for you to grab some Titan23 merch and baseball memorabilia for you or your family & friends.  I’ve also setup my Titan23 App so that you get access to exclusive content that isn’t available on other social media sites, like my training program, sweepstakes and contests, giveaways and the chance to get in on some cool experiences.\n \n​I hope that you guys like the App and just know that I’m working hard to make the Titan23 App and the content better every day.  Once you register, you can share your comments and let me know what you think.   For those of you who really want to get more access to content (like my boxing or golfing or cooking adventures) and experiences, you can subscribe to the premium content channel which gives you even more of the content and experiences that I am sharing.\n \n​Please know that 5% of the net sales from the App go to help support the charities that are important to me so I hope that you get a chance to grab some of your favorite merch or subscribe to the premium channel or pick up a great piece of memorabilia for your home or office.\n \n​Let’s stay connected.  Peace.\n \n​Adrian\n \n \n© 2020 PopFlyXP Inc. or its affiliates. PopFlyXP and TITAN23 brands, logos and registered brands used on the app and website are trademarks of PopFlyXP.

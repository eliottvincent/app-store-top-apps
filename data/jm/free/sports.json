No one can guarantee the result or statistics of a match with 100% accuracy before it is played. In case you bet on sports competitions based on our predictions, you do it at your own risk and we cannot be held responsible for your potential losses. You should never bet with amounts that you cannot afford losing. You are responsible for following rules and laws of your country."

Once you have added all your players, why not update the color of your team shirts to match the colors they play in? You can have different colors for your outfield and goalkeeper shirts.\nAfter getting your team shirt colors sorted, head over to the tactics screen. \nHere you can start moving the players around to position them in the formation you want them to play. If you want absolute position perfection then tap on the player, scroll to the bottom and tap on the change coordinates row to start moving and positioning players via their x and y center coordinates in relation to the pitch. \nWith the players in the correct positions, we recommend saving the formation via the formation screen which can be accessed by tapping the icon next to the share icon in the top right.\nNow let’s set up our line up by tapping on one of the player shirts. This will present a screen to change the player. Tap the player who you want in that position and repeat this for all your starting line up!\nFor an extra nice touch add your team’s captain by tapping the c icon in the top left.\nWith everything now looking great, make sure you also include your subs by tapping on the sub icon next to the captain c icon in the top left.\n\nFinally, tap the share icon and let the world or even just your team, team mates, friends, nan and  lovely cat see your team with a beautiful image that can be shared via any social media or messaging apps.\n\nPlease then make sure to rate the app as it really does help out - unless you don’t like it :).\n\nIf you have any feedback, feature requests or anything else then please reach out via the settings screen in the app.\n\nThis is a link to our terms of use - https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

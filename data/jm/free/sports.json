      "label": "In football today, the goalkeeper is a crucial part of the team and has significant impact on the final score of the match. To get the most of a goalkeeper, his training has to be adapted to specific age and performance classes. By properly selected exercises, explanations and carefully selected training units, the goalkeeper can progress more efficiently. According to your specific targets and aim of your training, you should select the appropriate application. Training of children and youth is divided into individual categories, which makes work with young goalkeepers much easier. The section which deals with how to keep the goalkeeper fit includes exercises aimed at developing physical abilities by means of match-like training with the ball. The training of 16 to 19 year olds is the same as with adults. When developing a young goalkeeper's physical abilities, the intensity of the load has to be increased continuously. All exercises are appropriate for men, women, boys and girls.\n\nThe application contains 46 free exercises which are completely described and illustrated by computer pictures. Most of them are completed by a video. In the chapter “Crosses” (16 – 19 and adults - Technical and tactical preparation - Crosses), you can find a complete training session with all parameters. You can buy the other exercises in a pack of 10. New training sessions with different topics will regularly be proposed to the coaches.\n\n• Free exercises: **57**\n• Free videos: **55*\n• Free diagrams: **59**\n• Free explanations: **8**\n• Free training sessions: **2**\n\n• Paying exercises: **780**\n• Videos which complete the paying exercises: **740**\n• Paying diagrams: **820**\n• Paying explanations: **7**\n• Paying training sessions: **29**\n\nYou need an internet connection to watch the free videos. After have bought a first pack, you can download and store all the free videos on your smartphone or tablet.  \n\nThe exercises were created with PRO TRAINING SYSTEMS.\n\n••• Alexander VENCEL •••\n\n• 2 March 1967 in Bratislava, Slovakia\n• UEFA Pro license coach\n• 20 years professional  goalkeeper (587 games)\n• National team Czechoslovakia and Slovakia (23 caps)\n• Player: Slovan Bratislava, RH Cheb, Slovan Bratislava, Racing Club Strasbourg, Le Havre Atletic Club\n• Coach: Le Havre Atletic Club, Racing Club Strasbourg\n• FIFA consultant and instructor for goalkeeping"

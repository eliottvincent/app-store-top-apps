      "label": "Dropping odds simply means that the bookmaker is adjusting his prices to reflect the true probabilities of an outcome or to balance his commission. Given that the odds were posted days or even weeks before the kick-off, this is the right thing to do.\n\nIf one bookmaker drops their odds, there's a reason for it and other bookies are likely to follow suit. Perhaps a market was originally overpriced or a key player is now injured etc. Whatever the scenario, if you can jump in before all bookmakers change their odds, you can be sure to find some great value.\n\nIn placing bets at the last minute, punters shift the odds on the event. For example: If a large volume of punters stake against one team in a match, the required pay-out on the teams will force the bookies to shorten the odds. In seeing these odds change, more punters chip in to try and get in on the action.\n\nOnce a bookmaker has determined what they believe to be the true odds of any outcome occurring in a given event, they will then adjust those odds downwards before offering them to punters.\n\nThe best bookmakers compile their own odds using their own team of odds compilers that will study ratings, form lines, statistics, and a variety of other factors that they may use to price-up a horse race.\n\nA number of factors can affect odds but the primary drivers for these changes are: New Information - Team selection, injury news etc. Market confidence - More information drives more liquidity in the market. Money - Where the money is going determines which way the odds move.\n\nBy using our real-time football dropping odds tracker tool, you can monitor all live changes and price drops for every game which is active for betting. Follow our dropping odds insights and utilize the latest betting market trends! Start monitoring the odds movements easily.\n\nWe present live soccer betting odds from the best online bookmakers in the world. The odds show an increase and decrease in the betting coefficient.

The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

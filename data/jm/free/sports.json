This App utilises historic game data to challenge you to predict the scores of a game based on their post-match-stats.\n\nDo you top your fantasy league tables? Do you know everything there is to know about Football? Limited stats are provided, such as shots on goal & corners for a game that has already been completed. Using this information you must predict the final score and are awarded points based on how correct they are.\n\nPoint Rewards:\nCorrect Result +10\nCorrect Home Goals +15\nCorrect Away Goals +15\n\nThe maximum points per game is 40, although you can also receive 0 if you don’t guess anything correctly!\n\nA hint system is implemented to give you a chance to obtain extra information on the game in order to influence your decision if you’re just not sure. There are 3 types of hint available: Reveal number of goals, Reveal the half time position, and reveal the team’s names. These pieces of information give you help, but don’t necessarily give you the final result, so use them carefully.\n\nEvery day compete with players around the world in a 5 game shootout. Can you score maximum points and top the leaderboard?\n\nMultiplayer mode allows you to challenge your friends on the Apple TV to decide once and for all who knows the most about football and whether stats do tell the whole story. Up to 8 players can play, you’re given a 15 second time limit to predict the score to keep the game flowing fast."

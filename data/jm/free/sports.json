This App utilises historic game data to challenge you to predict the scores of a game based on their post-match-stats.\n\nDo you top your fantasy league tables? Do you know everything there is to know about Football? Limited stats are provided, such as shots on goal & corners for a game that has already been completed. Using this information you must predict the final score and are awarded points based on how correct they are.\n\nPoint Rewards:\nCorrect Result +10\nCorrect Home Goals +15\nCorrect Away Goals +15\n\nThe maximum points per game is 40, although you can also receive 0 if you don’t guess anything correctly!\n\nA hint system is implemented to give you a chance to obtain extra information on the game in order to influence your decision if you’re just not sure. There are 3 types of hint available: Reveal number of goals, Reveal the half time position, and reveal the team’s names. These pieces of information give you help, but don’t necessarily give you the final result, so use them carefully.\n\nEvery day compete with players around the world in a 5 game shootout. Can you score maximum points and top the leaderboard?\n\nMultiplayer mode allows you to challenge your friends on the Apple TV to decide once and for all who knows the most about football and whether stats do tell the whole story. Up to 8 players can play, you’re given a 15 second time limit to predict the score to keep the game flowing fast."

      "label": "\"This is the best football stats app on the market, one that sets a new bar for this genre of apps, and an essential one for all football fans to download.\" - 6 Best Apps for Football Statistics, Ross Armstrong, TurboFuture\n\nFinding the stats needed for football betting is time consuming and often not possible. As a result, this puts the bookmakers at a significant advantage.\n\nEFS was developed to provide detailed stats of how teams have performed in key betting markets. The app will help to reduce the advantage and give you an improved chance of betting successfully. \n\nThere are a small number of leagues available in full, for all users, to give a sample of the opportunities and benefits that come with a full subscription. \n\nThe key benefits of the EFS app with a subscription are:\n\n* Detailed football stats & predictions\n\nThe app provides statistics and predictions for each game in a clear layout, covering all the key betting markets. These include:\n\n- Full Time Result, \n- Both Teams to Score (BTTS), \n- Result and BTTS, \n- Team Goals, Corners and Cards,\n- Match Goals, Corners and Cards, and many more\n\nIn addition, there is a full analysis of the league table, recent results and predictions and expected goals (xG) for each game. \n\n* Predictions and Value Bets\n\nThe app includes statistical predictions of the outcomes in the key betting markets. The predictions are a good starting point to research a game. \n\nThe app identifies value bets, where the price offered by the bookmaker is in excess of the fair odds. This allows you to find value and profitable lines. \n\n* Expected Goals (xG) Stats\n\nExpected goals figures are available for each game covered by the app. This allows a view in the flow of the game, and analysis of which teams are performing well without getting the results their play deserves.  \n\n* Fully Customisable Stats\n\nFootball accumulators and bets are often made on a hunch or a gut instinct. These are often biased and will favour the bookmaker. \n\nWithin EFS, you can customise all stats for any period. This period can cover a set number of matches, or a particular time frame. For a further level of analysis and detail, you can filter the stats for home or away matches, or all matches.\n\nThis information means you can build accumulators and place based on substance. These bets will have an increased chance of success.\n\n* In-depth Team Stats\n\nEach team has their own personal page, showing upcoming fixtures and previous results. Also included is an analysis of how each team has performed in the main betting markets, against the league averages. \n\n* In-depth League Analysis\n\nAll league tables are fully customisable, for home or away matches only, or for all matches. In addition, you can customise the league table for dates, to give an exclusive look at recent form. \n\nFurthermore, there is a full analysis of the league's result stats, goal stats and expected goals stats to allows you to spot current trends within the league.\n\nRegardless of whether you are a casual or expert football fan, there is a wealth of knowledge on the app waiting to be explored. Download, subscribe and find your edge today!\n\nThe Terms of Use (EULA) for the app can be found on the following link - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula\n\nWe hope you enjoy the app and we would love to hear from you. If you are enjoying the app, we would be grateful if you would leave us a positive review. If you have any technical issues or suggestions for new features, then please email the team on info@edgefootballstats.com."

      "label": "Dropping odds simply means that the bookmaker is adjusting his prices to reflect the true probabilities of an outcome or to balance his commission. Given that the odds were posted days or even weeks before the kick-off, this is the right thing to do.\n\nIf one bookmaker drops their odds, there's a reason for it and other bookies are likely to follow suit. Perhaps a market was originally overpriced or a key player is now injured etc. Whatever the scenario, if you can jump in before all bookmakers change their odds, you can be sure to find some great value.\n\nIn placing bets at the last minute, punters shift the odds on the event. For example: If a large volume of punters stake against one team in a match, the required pay-out on the teams will force the bookies to shorten the odds. In seeing these odds change, more punters chip in to try and get in on the action.\n\nOnce a bookmaker has determined what they believe to be the true odds of any outcome occurring in a given event, they will then adjust those odds downwards before offering them to punters.\n\nThe best bookmakers compile their own odds using their own team of odds compilers that will study ratings, form lines, statistics, and a variety of other factors that they may use to price-up a horse race.\n\nA number of factors can affect odds but the primary drivers for these changes are: New Information - Team selection, injury news etc. Market confidence - More information drives more liquidity in the market. Money - Where the money is going determines which way the odds move.\n\nBy using our real-time football dropping odds tracker tool, you can monitor all live changes and price drops for every game which is active for betting. Follow our dropping odds insights and utilize the latest betting market trends! Start monitoring the odds movements easily.\n\nWe present live soccer betting odds from the best online bookmakers in the world. The odds show an increase and decrease in the betting coefficient. This will help you to better define your betting strategy.\n\nWe cover all the top soccer leagues in the world such as the English Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Serie A, Bundesliga, Eredivisie and many more.

      "label": "The Strikeman app allows users to practice their shooting skills without the need for real ammunition. Using our laser bullet, target and smart phone mount, the app records the target and records the users shot scores based on where the laser hit the target.\n \nThe app is composed of 3 sections:\n \nSection 1 – Training\nThe training section is the initial area of the app where the user can practice their shooting skills. Upon beginning a session, a warning screen is shown to ensure that proper firearm safety is taking place before beginning a session. Once the user agrees, the target appears on the screen. The user calibrates the screen to the target by using two fingers to cover the circumference of the target. Then, the distance from the target is selected and they can begin shooting. Each shot from the firearm triggers a laser, which emits a laser strike on the target, and the app records the score. Shooting metrics appear on the screen to show the user how they are doing during the session. This is accompanied by audio. Once the session is complete, all shots will be shown on the target and saved into an archive.\n \nSection 2 – History\nThe history section provides screenshots, shooting metrics, and graphs for the user to track their progress. This includes average score, average range, total shots and total sessions. The information is presented on a histogram and a pie chart. This information is saved in an archive. \n \nSection 3 – Settings\nThe settings section allows the user to turn on/off gun shot audio and voice feedback. Users can toggle the distance metric, selecting either feet or yards. They can also report an issue if the app isn’t working correctly. The App provides access to the initial tutorial to ensure that all safety precautions are being taken.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.strikeman.io/pages/ios-privacy-page\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

But let’s not forget all the football that is played every day in Brent – school football, Community Sports Clubs, recreational sessions, 5-a-side sessions, walking football and ‘jumpers for goalposts’ games.\n\nEveryone knows about the physical and mental benefits of taking part in sport, but it can be even more rewarding and exciting to get involved as a coach or to video the local community in action and show the positive benefits that sport has.\n\nWe want people aged 16 years who are passionate about football and who want to bring some of this passion to their local communities.\nYou can get involved in 2 ways;\n\n1) Train to become a football coach – attend a series of workshops to become qualified. \n\n2) Train to become a Video Sports Reporter – attend a bespoke training course that will give you the skills to be a Reporter. \n\nFor more information see footballfever.tv"

Replays of otherwise hidden areas in the field can be carried out, even if they were not at the focus of attention during the event itself.\n\nUsers are able to stream the event live, or capture it with the camera head and view it after the event has finished. They can broadcast and share their own events via this mobile app, or the web.\n\nUsers can choose to see any portion of the event they want, using CSports's App. The App cannot broadcast anything that you did not capture with CSports's proprietary camera head in the first place."

Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

      "label": "LakeMonster is an app designed to serve the fishing and recreational boating communities by providing a simple interface to find current lake conditions for thousands of lakes across the world.\n\nEach lake provides you with past and current water temperatures, weather conditions and forecasts (wind speed/direction, air temperature, pressure), and maps showing recently acquired satellite imagery, which can be used to identify ice conditions, water levels, and water color/clarity. Download the LakeMonster app today, your personal lake map, weather forecasting, water temperature, and fishing log tool. \n\nFIND THE BEST BOATING SPOTS\n• Know where the warmest and coolest water is on your favorite lakes with LakeMonster’s thermal imagery.\n• Up to date lake water temperatures for thousands of lakes across the United States.\n\nFIND BEST FISHING SPOTS\n• Thermal Maps - fish bite more and less depending on the cool and warm spots on your lake, use this tool to catch more fish.\n• Determine current and future lake conditions including air temperature, wind speed/direction, and pressure\n• Ice Fishing - View recent natural color satellite imagery to view water levels, ice on/off, water color, and water clarity conditions\n• Search our catalog of thousands of lakes to learn more about your favorite lakes and discover new ones near and far using our lake map.\n\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n• Social feed - Post information on your latest trip to the lake, or ask questions from the user community.\n\nAnglers, recreational boaters, kayakers/canoers, and beachgoers all have similar lake information needs. In winter, ice anglers come to LakeMonster to watch water temperatures drop and natural color satellite images show their favorite lakes freeze over to anticipate when they can begin ice fishing. In spring, open water fisherman use LakeMonster to find “ice-out” on their favorite lakes, determine when to get the boat out of storage, and watch water temperatures rise during the crucial walleye spawning season.  During the busy summer months, LakeMonster is used by all to check temperatures, wind speed and direction, pressure, and more. As summer turns into fall, everyone is checking LakeMonster to see which lake levels are dropping, and anglers are again constantly checking water temperatures—this time to see temperatures drop, sending perch and walleye into a feeding frenzy. And once again, ice anglers are anxiously waiting for those temperatures to drop down into the 30’s and keeping an eye on the natural color imagery to see when ice starts forming on their favorite lakes. \n\nLakeMonster Pro is available as an optional upgrade for $7.99/month or $83.99/year. You can subscribe and pay through your App Store account. Your subscription will automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

      "label": "Predictions for World’s Basketball in One Single App\n\nWe provide AI powered betting predictions for various basketball tournaments from the globe, including NBA from USA and EuroLeague from Europe. Our algorithms constantly analyze the performance situation of basketball teams and generate predictions for final game results and total score figures for each game. No human interaction is involved in the generation of predictions, and we solely rely on our algorithms. Algorithms work in a way so that predictions are generated consistently, which is not really feasible when predictions are made by humans. Our AI algorithms look at a large number of features when generating predictions and can learn how each feature may affect the result of a basketball game. Predictions are renewed periodically and past prediction results are openly shared in our application. With out app, you don’t need to spend so much time on game and team stats, basketball props, and game highlights. Basketball Betting Tipster automates the performance analysis work for you so that you can focus on thinking how to use the predictions to develop the best basketball betting strategy to beat the bookies. Whenever possible, we even share reference betting odds for each prediction so that you can even consider odds when using the predictions when developing your basketball betting strategy.\n\nGame Result Predictions\n\nOur AI algorithms generate the likelihood of each basketball team to win the game that will be played. These predictions are probabilistic and shared as a percentage figure for each team. Since there is always a winner in basketball games, the team having a winning probability that is greater than 50% is the expected winner based on our algorithms. Our algorithms expect that a given game is riskier for betting when these probabilities are close to each other (say 48% and 52%). As the winning probability increases and gets closer to 100% for a given team, it indicates a stronger confidence on the prediction for that team to win the game. Whenever it is possible, reference odds are made available as well from bookmakers for each game result prediction.\n\nTotal Score Predictions\n\nBeside game result predictions, we even share total score predictions for each game. It is very challenging to be very accurate on total score predictions so that beside the total score prediction, we even share a prediction interval for the total score itself. For example, if the total score prediction is – say – 180 for a given basketball game, our algorithms also provide an interval i.e. the total score of the game is expected to be between 168 and 192. In this way, you can try to pick the best bet for total score betting for basketball games. Whenever it is possible, reference betting odds are made available for total score predictions as well in our mobile app."

Perform-up Tennis, la tua palestra mentale a portata di mano in grado di potenziare le tue abilità mentali e sviluppare il tuo benessere personale. L’applicazione  è stata costruita considerando le recenti ricerche scientifiche della Psicologia dello Sport, della Psicologia Positiva e del Mental Training.\r\nGli esercizi presenti nell’applicazione ti insegneranno, in maniera graduale, a padroneggiare le tre tecniche fondamentali dell’allenamento mentale: la respirazione, il rilassamento e la visualizzazione mentale.\r\nIl programma di allenamento settimanale ti permetterà di integrare l’allenamento tecnico, tattico e fisico con quello mentale. Ogni settimana troverai esercizi diversi che ti aiuteranno a rafforzare la tua forza mentale.\n\nRespirazione e Rilassamento sono i protagonisti delle settimane di allenamento mentale. Attraverso questi esercizi imparerai a controllare le tue emozioni dentro e fuori dal campo, riuscirai gestire lo stress recuperando le tue energie. Diventerai più consapevole delle tue capacità, delle tue sensazioni ed emozioni. La capacità di controllare il tuo corpo ti aiuterà a migliorare il tuo focus.\r\nGli esercizi di Visualizzazione mentale hanno una parte dedicata chiamata: “Migliora il tuo tennis”. Questa tecnica ti permetterà di consolidare nella memoria e lungo termine il gesto motorio, rafforzare i colpi, rivedere azioni di gioco e migliorare così la tua concentrazione in campo.\r\nAccedendo all’app inserirai le tue informazioni personali (età, sesso, braccio dominante e categoria tennistica), queste permetteranno all’app di personalizzare il tuo percorso di allenamento settimanale. \r\nSi potrà proseguire con le settimane di allenamento mentale una volta terminati gli esercizi della settimana precedente. Il tempo richiesto ad esercizio va dai 3 minuti ai 15 minuti circa. Durante le prime settimane di allenamento mentale gli esercizi avranno una durata breve di circa 3-4 minuti a singolo esercizio per un massimo di 4 esercizi a settimana. La difficoltà degli esercizi e la durata aumenteranno progressivamente con la pratica.\r\nL’app ti consente di personalizzare la pratica: puoi decidere di intensificare il numero di esercizi da svolgere, tornare indietro con le settimane, svolgere esercizi delle settimane precedenti oppure darti una pausa sull’allenamento settimanale e riprendere quando preferisci.\r\n\r\nBasteranno poco minuti al giorno per allenare le tue abilità mentali e migliorare la tua performance sportiva. \r\nScarica oggi Perform-UP Tennis e inizia a cambiare le tue routine.\r\n\r\n\nCOSA TROVERAI NELL’APP:\r\nContenuti audio e video\r\nEsercizi di respirazione per adulti e bambini\r\nEsercizi di rilassamento per adulti e bambini\r\nEsercizi di visualizzazione mentale per adulti e bambini\r\nEsercizi motivazionali\r\nProgramma di allenamento mentale personalizzato\r\nEsercizi da svolgere settimanalmente da integrare con l’attività sportiva\r\nTieni traccia del tuo allenamento mentale\r\n\r\n\nA CHE ETÀ È CONSIGLIATA:\r\nL’app è consigliata ad un pubblico adulto e bambino. All’interno dell’app il percorso viene personalizzato a seconda dell’età. I bambini hanno un programma di allenamento di respirazione e rilassamento “propedeutico” all’apprendimento di tecniche mentali. Inoltre negli esercizi di visualizzazione mentale potranno guardare video di atleti della stessa età.\r\nIl percorso dei bambini può essere seguito dal maestro o dai genitori ed utilizzato come strumento per iniziare ad allenare le abilità mentali del piccolo atleta. I maestri/genitori fanno scaricare l’app al bambino e lo guidano settimanalmente nello svolgere gli esercizi mentali.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\nTERMINI E CONDIZIONI: https://sarabordo.com/privacy-perform-up/\r\n\r\nHAI BISOGNO DI MAGGIORI INFORMAZIONI: Contattaci a performupsrl@gmail.com"

      "label": "Are you a tennis player looking to improve your game? And is the mental game also one of your challenges? Then look no further. Choking, emotional outbursts, lack of motivation, lack of consistency, all soon to be a thing of your past mentality.\nFrom recreational to the professional level, as tennis players, we all deal with the same mental challenges. We want to play our best tennis, consistently. We want to remain calm under pressure. We want to will ourselves into flow. We want to be the player that always wins those tough and close matches.\n\nAnd yet, most coaches can offer us only technical and physical training drills. Good coaches will help with the tactical side as well. But mental training is reserved for the select few top ATP players. This needs not to be the case.\n\nYou can work on your own game! And especially the mental game. As a mental coach, I’ve helped hundreds of players to get the best out of themselves, to win more often, and even to enjoy tennis more intensely. I have written a book about a concrete step-by-step method of mental training. As an addition to that, I designed this Inner Tennis app to motivate you to find your inner strength as a tennis player and a person.\n\nThe quotes in this app are inspired by the ancient spiritual teachings about warriors, written by Carlos Castaneda in his book The Wheel of Time. Mixed together with concrete techniques from sport psychology, I’ve turned these spiritual teachings into a five-chapter mental-training program that any tennis player can follow. \n\nRead the quotes as many times as you can. Think about them. Internalize them. Make them your own. Most importantly, do the chapter assignments. Be honest with yourself. Make notes of all your thoughts. Then revisit, and if necessary even change those notes. Use this app as a guide for your journey to becoming a mentally strong tennis player. \n\nBest of luck! And if you have any questions or if you need support, feel free to contact me on contact@top-tennis.net."

Check our AI score predictions and develop stronger betting strategies.\n\nFor people being interested in sports and sports betting in particular, who don't have the time to analyze tens & hundreds of games every week, Wise Prediction offers AI powered sports betting predictions for soccer games (European football matches). Since we let machines analyze teams and make predictions, all our predictions are generated in a consistent manner.\n\nIf you are interested in sports betting but don’t have the time to do the analysis on all soccer teams, our solutions can help you to deal with this problem. Our AI powered algorithms continuously analyze performance of soccer teams and help us figure out which results we can expect from upcoming soccer matches.\n\nIn our approach, we provide a probability for the likelihood of each of following bets to hold in each given match:\n\n- Home Wins (1)\n- Tie (X)\n- Away Wins (2)\n- Under 2.5 Goals (U2.5)\n- Over 2.5 Goals (O2.5)\n\nEach probability represents the level of confidence for each betting prediction. Higher the prediction confidence, more confident our AI models are on the shared prediction.\n\nApart from our sports betting predictions, we share reference odds from bookies for each bet so that you can evaluate our predictions by taking betting odds into consideration. Note that given reference odds may vary between bookmakers.\n\nFor today's football, you can use our past prediction accuracy stats, highlight the matches that suits your taste, and develop your betting strategy more wisely.\n\nOur soccer predictions are shared on a daily basis. Some predictions are shared for free while our VIP members get full access to all our sports betting predictions. In a busy week, we share predictions for up to 300 football matches and cover various football leagues from 20 countries as following: Australia (A-League), Austria (Tipp3 Bundesliga), Belgium (Jupiler Pro League), China (Super League), Denmark (Superligaen), England (Premier League, Championship, League One, League Two), France (Ligue 1, Ligue 2), Germany (Bundesliga 1, Bundesliga 2), Greece (Super League), Italy (Serie A, Serie B), Netherlands (Eredivisie), Norway (Eliteserien), Portugal (Primeira Liga), Russia (Super League), Scotland (Scottish Premiership), Spain (La Liga, La Liga 2), Sweden (Allsvenskan), Switzerland (Super League), Turkey (Super League), USA (MLS), Japan (J1 League), South Africa (Premier Division), Peru Uruguay, Colombia and Chile (Primera Division), Saudi Arabia (Pro League), Mexico (Liga MX), India (Indian Super League), Poland (Ekstraklasa), Croatia (Prva HNL), World Cup, Euro Championship and more.\n\nNo human interaction is involved when generating our predictions, and we solely rely on our own models that we have developed at Wise Prediction. Please note that predictions only represent the expected likelihood of each potential result by our models but sports competitions are always subject to end with unexpected results. No one can guarantee the result or statistics of a match with 100% accuracy before it is played. In case you bet on sports competitions based on our predictions, you do it at your own risk and we cannot be held responsible for your potential losses. You should never bet with amounts that you cannot afford losing. You are responsible for following rules and laws of your country."

The only thing required is to connect your iPhone and your TV device to the same Wifi network—and your touchscreen will turn into a navigation pane with all the functions of the usual remote.\n\nFEATURES: \n• Quick and simple to use: the app serves as the physical remote and is always at hand  \n• Automatic customization: makes things a bit more user-friendly to set up\n• Haptic feedback: gives this awesome vibration and sense of realism\n• Nice responsive touchpad: for the aesthetically pleasing look, feel, and touch\n• Keyboard input: makes TV searching a no-brainer\n• Works through WIFI: the app automatically detects any TVs on your network for you to control everything smartly with your phone\n\nUniversal Remote TV Control is a full-featured mobile version of a physical TV remote that makes your life much easier. No need to get up from the couch and go for the remote or to buy a new one in case you lost it. Sync the app with your device to browse your favorite shows, movies, and programs easily with a phone. Make the most out of technology for your better smarter life!\n\nDisclaimer:\nUniversal Remote TV Control is NOT the official application of Samsung, LG, Sony, Philips, Panasonic, and it is NOT affiliated with or endorsed by these or any other companies.\n \nFor complete access to all Universal Remote TV Control features, you will need to subscribe to Premium.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION:\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.

      "label": "Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online. We know that every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we designed tools like Family Link that give you the flexibility to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. Family Link’s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.\n\n\nWith Family Link, you can:\n\nEstablish Digital Ground Rules\n• Set screen time limits — Family Link lets you set downtime for your child’s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.\n• Guide them to age-appropriate content — Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.\n\nManage and secure your child’s account \n• Protect their privacy — Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child’s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child’s device. \n• Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.\n\nStay connected on the go\n• See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.\n• Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location.  You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.\n\n\nImportant Information\n\n• Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/\n• While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.\n• You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.\n• To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.\n• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.\n• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family."

We are confident that navigation with swipe gestures is much more convenient than by pressing regular \"down\" or \"right\" buttons, not distracting you from the most important thing: searching for your favorite movie or series on the TV.\n\nStill Can’t Turn the TV On? In a word, you can, but under one condition. Most new Smart TV models support the Wake-on-LAN function. It is possible only if you had already been connected to the TV earlier.

After that, you can use your Universal Remote.\n\nPremium Subscription\n\nYou can subscribe for unlimited access to Premium features.

      "label": "Get the people-first browser that’s backed by a non-profit. \n\nIt’s a new era in tech. Don’t settle for a browser produced by giant, profit-driven, data-hoarding tech companies. Firefox is the obvious choice for independent, ethical tech that respects your privacy and gives you more ways than ever to tailor your internet experience exactly the way you want it. Download Firefox now for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nFirefox is backed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. When you make Firefox your go-to, everyday browser, you’re also joining a unique (serious nerd cred) community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  \n\nFirefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. \nWe want you to have an amazing experience every time you use Firefox. We know feeling safe and secure are foundational for enjoying your time online. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.\n\nDIFFERENT DEVICES.  SAME TRAIN OF THOUGHT\nNow you can search for things on your laptop, then pick up the exact same search on your phone and vice versa. Your Firefox homepage displays the most recent searches you’ve done on other devices so you can easily get back to what you were doing or thinking about. \n\nLIMITED-EDITION WALLPAPERS\nIntroducing limited-edition wallpapers from independent creators. Stick with one you love or switch it up anytime to make Firefox match your mood. \n\n\nSTREAMLINED HOME SCREEN\nPick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.\n\nPRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES\nFirefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to strict blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.\n\nGET FIREFOX ON  ALL YOUR DEVICES\nAdd Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. In addition to synced tabs and searches, Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.\n\nFIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR\nGet search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.\n\nORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE\nCreate as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails and numbered tabs, making it easy to find what you want quickly.\n\nSHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS\nThe Firefox web browser makes it easy to share links to web pages or specific items on a page with easy, quick access to your most recently used apps.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT FIREFOX WEB BROWSER:\n- Read about Firefox permissions: http://mzl.la/Permissions\n- Learn more about what’s up at Mozilla: https://blog.mozilla.org\n\nABOUT MOZILLA\nMozilla exists to build the Internet as a public resource accessible to all because we believe open and free is better than closed and controlled. We build products like Firefox to promote choice and transparency and give people more control over their lives online.

There ARE other apps that can help you quickly delete photos on your phone. But none of them worked for us. \n\nWe wanted a simple, fast, elegant solution that let us go month-by-month, work our way through all the photos, videos, screenshots, and everything else in our camera roll, and decide - one by one - what to keep and what to get rid of.\n\nSwipe right to keep a photo, and left to delete it. If you make a mistake, just tap the current photo to go back. At the end of each month, you'll get one last look at the photos you chose to keep and delete, and can make any tweaks if you need to. Then...you're done! You'll be shown how many images you deleted, and how much space you've saved - for this month, and all-time. \n\nEach time you finish a month, it'll be crossed out. (You can always revisit it, though.) If you get part way through a month and want to take a break, you can quit the app - an indicator to the right of the month's name will show you how much progress you've made, and how much further you have to go.\n\nOur camera rolls shouldn't be such a mess. Scrolling back, you should be able to see the memories you've made without getting interrupted by blurry duplicates, irrelevant screenshots, and other clutter that keeps you from the good stuff.\n\nSo, Swipewipe was born. We hope you like it.\n\nApple Terms of Use Agreement: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

This app distinguishes itself with its reliability, ease of use, speed, and with a true \"2-way sync\" that merges changes made to either account.  This is the #1 app for syncing contacts both in terms of downloads & reviews.\n\nAlso of significance, this app syncs your Google labels or Outlook categories with iPhone. For instance, you may have organized your Google contacts into groups such as \"friends,\" \"family,\" and \"coworkers.\"  After syncing, your iPhone and Google groups will match.  Once your groups are synced, you can easily send group emails from your iPhone.\n\nNew for 2022, the app is now capable of syncing your Outlook contacts with one of your iPhone accounts, such as iCloud.  Your Outlook contacts can belong to a personal account, such as Outlook.com, or a business account, such as Office 365.\n\nNew for 2021, the app is now capable of syncing 2 Google accounts with each other, so you can share the same contacts between a personal Google account and a work Google account, for example!\n\nCONTACT ACCOUNTS:\n• Choose to sync Google with iPhone, Outlook with iPhone, or 2 Google accounts\n• Choose to sync a specific iPhone account, such as a local iPhone address book, iCloud, Exchange, or a CardDAV account\n\nSYNC TYPES:\n• Choose from one of the following sync types: 2-way sync, 1-way Sync, and Manual Sync\n• Choose a 2-way sync to sync changes in both directions\n• Choose a 1-way sync to transfer changes in one direction only\n• Choose a manual sync to sync specific contacts only\n\nSYNCS ALL FIELDS:\n• Syncs all fields including names, phonetic names, nicknames, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses, company names, job titles, departments, birthdays, anniversaries, events, notes, web page addresses, relationships, instant messaging accounts, & social profiles\n• Syncs contact photos\n• Syncs custom labels & custom fields\n\nINITIAL SYNC:\n• During the initial sync, the contents of matching contacts will be merged\n\nCONFIRM CHANGES BEFORE SYNCING:\n• Review each change before the sync actually begins\n\nAUTOMATIC SYNC:\n• Automatically syncs contacts in the background 24/7\n\nAPPLY FILTERS INCLUDING GROUP FILTER:\n• Apply the group filter, new contact filter, and more!\n\nDUPLICATES:\n• Eliminate Google duplicates directly from the app, and then sync to remove the same duplicates from iPhone\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS:\n• Contacts Sync offers a \"Premium\" subscription which unlocks all of the premium features in the app, including the ability to sync an unlimited numbers of contacts and to auto sync in the background.\n• Without an upgrade, the app will sync no more than 40 contacts\n• The \"Premium\" subscription is priced at $1.99 USD per month or $4.99 USD per year\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at a cost of $1.99 USD per month or $4.99 USD per year\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n• Terms of use: https://playaapps.zendesk.com/hc/articles/360004197333\n• Privacy Policy: https://playaapps.zendesk.com/hc/articles/226767688"

      "label": "The only payment link you'll ever need to send and receive payment.\n\nThe story of paylinkz started when I realized that anytime I needed to send money or pay for a service that was rendered to me - I would ALWAYS ask the question \"what payment app do you have?\". I noticed that some had Venmo, others had CashApp, and some people had PayPal and Zelle combined. It came to my realization that some people had a strong preference for the payment app that they preferred. After all, we live in 2022 and no one ever carries cash on them.\n\nThe whole process of asking for usernames and then figuring out the right app to open on your phone, and then making sure that the right username has been entered seemed clunky and needed to be improved. As a software engineer and an entrepreneur at heart, I went straight to work to build a unified platform that makes it easy to add all your payment profiles into one place.\n\nThe goal here is to switch the question from \"what payment app do you have?\". to \"Send me your paylinkz url\" and to remove the friction from sending and receiving money.\n\nI hope you find a lot of value in it."

      "label": "Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online. We know that every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we designed tools like Family Link that give you the flexibility to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. Family Link’s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.\n\n\nWith Family Link, you can:\n\nEstablish Digital Ground Rules\n• Set screen time limits — Family Link lets you set downtime for your child’s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.\n• Guide them to age-appropriate content — Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.\n\nManage and secure your child’s account \n• Protect their privacy — Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child’s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child’s device. \n• Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child's account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.\n\nStay connected on the go\n• See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.\n• Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location.  You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.\n\n\nImportant Information\n\n• Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/\n• While Family Link helps you manage your child's purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.\n• You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.\n• To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.\n• Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.\n• While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family."

      "label": "Get the people-first browser that’s backed by a non-profit. \n\nIt’s a new era in tech. Don’t settle for a browser produced by giant, profit-driven, data-hoarding tech companies. Firefox is the obvious choice for independent, ethical tech that respects your privacy and gives you more ways than ever to tailor your internet experience exactly the way you want it. Download Firefox now for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nFirefox is backed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. When you make Firefox your go-to, everyday browser, you’re also joining a unique (serious nerd cred) community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  \n\nFirefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. \nWe want you to have an amazing experience every time you use Firefox. We know feeling safe and secure are foundational for enjoying your time online. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.\n\nDIFFERENT DEVICES.  SAME TRAIN OF THOUGHT\nNow you can search for things on your laptop, then pick up the exact same search on your phone and vice versa. Your Firefox homepage displays the most recent searches you’ve done on other devices so you can easily get back to what you were doing or thinking about. \n\nLIMITED-EDITION WALLPAPERS\nIntroducing limited-edition wallpapers from independent creators. Stick with one you love or switch it up anytime to make Firefox match your mood. \n\n\nSTREAMLINED HOME SCREEN\nPick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.\n\nPRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES\nFirefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to strict blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.\n\nGET FIREFOX ON  ALL YOUR DEVICES\nAdd Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. In addition to synced tabs and searches, Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.\n\nFIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR\nGet search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.\n\nORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE\nCreate as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails and numbered tabs, making it easy to find what you want quickly.\n\nSHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS\nThe Firefox web browser makes it easy to share links to web pages or specific items on a page with easy, quick access to your most recently used apps.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT FIREFOX WEB BROWSER:\n- Read about Firefox permissions: http://mzl.la/Permissions\n- Learn more about what’s up at Mozilla: https://blog.mozilla.org\n\nABOUT MOZILLA\nMozilla exists to build the Internet as a public resource accessible to all because we believe open and free is better than closed and controlled. We build products like Firefox to promote choice and transparency and give people more control over their lives online.

I noticed that some had Venmo, others had CashApp, and some people had PayPal and Zelle combined. It came to my realization that some people had a strong preference for the payment app that they preferred. After all, we live in 2022 and no one ever carries cash on them.\n\nThe whole process of asking for usernames and then figuring out the right app to open on your phone, and then making sure that the right username has been entered seemed clunky and needed to be improved. As a software engineer and an entrepreneur at heart, I went straight to work to build a unified platform that makes it easy to add all your payment profiles into one place.\n\nThe goal here is to switch the question from \"what payment app do you have?\". to \"Send me your paylinkz url\" and to remove the friction from sending and receiving money.\n\nI hope you find a lot of value in it."

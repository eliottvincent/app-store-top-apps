      "label": "James Strong, former professor of exegetical theology at Drew Theological Seminary, spent more than thirty-five years preparing his landmark concordance. First published in 1890 with the help of more than one hundred colleagues, Strong's remains the most widely used concordance and dictionary of Bible words from the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nThis updated edition of Strong's Exhaustive Concordance takes James Strong's monumental work and updates it to be even more useful to the modern reader. It maintains all of the features that have made Strong's indispensable for over 100 years: \n- Allows the reader to easily find all biblical occurrences of a word in the King James Version\n- Points the reader to the underlying Hebrew and Greek words\n- Uses the Strong's numbering system which is used in many of the new study tools of today \n\nAnd adds new features that make it even more useful: \n- Corrected, updated, and expanded using the latest computing search tools\n- Extra-clear font and page design make this edition readable and easy to navigate\n- Updated and improved Hebrew and Greek dictionaries tie each word to the Greek or Hebrew root\n- Discover the Hebrew and Greek words underlying the KJV English using the Strong's numbering system\n- Use the updated Hebrew and Greek dictionaries to find brief definitions of each word of the original languages\n\nGo beyond mere searches for lost verses and hone your skills by utilizing this tool's more advanced features.\n\nFind every occurrence of any word in the King James Version Bible. Only the words not likely to be used in locating a passage have been eliminated (words such as should, those, and when) or condensed to include only the important occurrences (words such as bring, day, and might). \n\nStudents of the Bible utilize the wealth of resources offered in Strong's ranging from doing word and thematic studies to probing the deeper meanings embedded in the original languages of the Bible."

With Scripture and personal reflections, New York Times bestselling author Sarah Young brings Jesus' message of peace—for today and every day.\n\nBy spending time in the presence of the Savior with the much-loved devotions in Jesus Calling, you will:\n\n  * Feel comforted by a daily word of hope and encouragement\n  * Be reassured of Jesus' unending blessings and love for you\n  * Receive gentle guidance based on daily Scripture readings\n  * Connect with Jesus further with reflection and meditation based on God’s Word\n\nWritten as if Jesus Himself is speaking directly to you, Jesus Calling invites you to experience peace in the presence of the Savior who is always with you. These writings are personal reflections based on Jesus’ own words of hope, guidance, and peace within Scripture—penned by one who loves Him and revered His Word. The Bible is the only infallible, inerrant Word of God, and author Sarah Young endeavors to keep her writings consistent with that unchanging standard. She has written from the perspective of Jesus speaking, to help readers feel more personally connected with Him. So the first person singular (“I,” “Me,” “My,” “Mine”) always refers to Christ; “you” refers to you, the reader.\n \nSarah Young has included Scripture references after each daily reading and wove them into the devotions. Words from the Scriptures are indicated in italics.  Themes of thankfulness, prayer, and trust recur often in the daily devotions as they are essential for a close relationship with the Lord.\n \nThe devotions in this app are meant to be read slowly, preferably in a quiet place. Remember that Jesus is Immanuel, God with us. May you enjoy His Presence and His Peace in ever-increasing measure."

      "label": "Based on Joyce Meyer's New York Times bestseller Power Thoughts, this devotional includes 365 opportunities to tap into God's power in your daily life by thinking and speaking His way. The POWER THOUGHTS DEVOTIONAL will provide you with life-changing declarations of truth, directly from God's Word, to think and speak over your life every day of the year.\n\nThis daily app has a devotion search feature, customized daily push notifications, and the ability to combine your favorite passages with images into beautiful shareable 'Quotos'! \n\nProverbs 18:21 says, \"Death and life are in the power of the tongue.\" Simply put, words are containers for power--positive or negative, creative or destructive. Therefore, it is imperative that you learn to think and speak on purpose, using the life-giving wisdom in God's Word. When you do, your life will never be the same!\n\nIf you struggle with being negative, critical, or judgmental of people and situations, don't be discouraged. God wants to help you renew your mind to think and speak as He would. It won't happen overnight--but each day you will make progress as you choose power thoughts to be more like Jesus.\n\nIt's time for you to experience and enjoy the life God created you to live, and Joyce wants to help you get there. You can do it with this devotional by learning how to think and speak power thoughts daily."

The DEBATER gives many ways to argue against Christians, Creationists, and Bible thumpers.  It is set up for very quick reference and memorization, yet contains full arguments as well as different ways to argue the same topics.\n \nCurrent Rating =  4.66/5\n\nExamples include \"Lack of Historical Evidence for Jesus,\"  \"America Was NOT Created as a Christian Nation,\" and  \"God Is Too Hidden to Be Real,\" as well as others.  Arm yourself with very powerful and logical arguments against religious zealots. \n\nSKEPTICISM section contains many subjects related to being a skeptic. Learn how to debunk claims scientifically in just a few questions with \"Bogus Claims Debunker.\"  Aliens, ghosts, psychics, and get-rich-quick schemes are deconstructed using logic.  Several articles were generously provided by Skeptic magazine!\n\nHUMANISM section is a positive and uplifting area consisting of humanistic articles, including \"Declaration of Human Rights\" and \"Life Is to Be Lived Now,\" to name a few. It shows that most of us share humanistic interests, whether we realize it or not, and science is our most valuable tool for humanity. \"The Humanist Manifesto\" is among several articles provided by the American Humanist Association."

By clicking on each word or phrase its meaning in simple Greek or a sketch will pop up (open) in a new window. The translation of the same items can also be found in the Λεξιλόγια (Vocabularies) section.\n\nC. Ασκήσεις\nYou will find a wide selection of exercises which aim at reinforcing your reading comprehension and writing skills.

God will open your eyes to certain deep truths, which will completely transform your life and make you exceptional.\n\nThis topic is so uncommon that many people spend their entire lifetime without knowing anything about it. Yet, such knowledge determines a lot of things.\n\nThe truth, however, is that what we are considering in this chapter cannot be found on the surface of the scriptures. They are like hidden treasures tucked away in some chests. Hence, we shall examine some of the deepest scriptures ever found in the word of God.\n\nThese deep Scriptures can make a great difference between living or dying, enjoying victory or suffering defeat, living under abject poverty or enjoying stupendous wealth. In fact, what you are going to discover in this book will determine a lot of things in your life in the days, weeks, months and years ahead. You will discover the secrets of doing exploits for God and reigning in the realm of the supernatural.\n\nBy the time you learn how to pray in line with what you will discover, every area of your life will move forward by fire."

      "label": "In celebration of selling 3 million copies, FaithWords is publishing a special expanded edition of “Battlefield of the Mind.” \n\nThis expanded audiobook edition includes an additional introduction read by Joyce Meyer, the audiobook as read by Pat Lentz, and updated content throughout the book; it does not include the book text. \n\nAs a bonus there is also a PDF, “The Battle of the Mind for Kids.”\n\nWorry, doubt, confusion, depression, anger and feelings of condemnation: all these are attacks on the mind. If readers suffer from negative thoughts, they can take heart! Joyce Meyer has helped millions win these all-important battles. In her most popular best seller ever, the beloved author and minister shows readers how to change their lives by changing their minds.\n\nShe teaches how to deal with thousands of thoughts that people think every day and how to focus the mind the way God thinks. And she shares the trials, tragedies, and ultimate victories from her own marriage, family, and ministry that led her to wondrous, life-transforming truth — and reveals her thoughts and feelings every step of the way.\n\nThis app is part of, and makes use of, the Folium Stellar™ network.\n\n• PLAYER CONTROLS.  Includes listen (play), pause, multi-speed fast forward/reverse, jump ahead/back, chapter skip, one-touch chapter- and bookmark browser. There is also a “scrub” bar that finds any point inside the chapter with just a tap.\n\n• SLEEP TIMER. Have you ever fallen asleep watching TV or listening to something? If so, you'll love this feature. Once set, the app will stop, place a bookmark, and allow you to jump back to where you probably began dozing.\n\n• CLEAR & ELEGANT DESIGN.  Simple, clean, intuitive, and smarter than average.\n\n• CHAPTER TIMINGS. Always know how much time it will take to finish a chapter.\n\n• OFFLINE LISTENING. You are airplane-ready! Once downloaded, listen uninterrupted without threat from a lost network connection. Downloads are usually just 5-10 minutes, but depend upon your network speed.\n\n• AUTO-BOOKMARKING.  The player remembers where you stopped listening and returns to that exact spot when you open the app again.\n\n• SOCIAL SHARING. An easy way to recommend the app to your friends."

      "label": "Your precious bundle needs a name, but how to choose? The name options appear endless and different people have very different tastes. That you’ve probably gathered already by talking with your partner about the future baby’s name. Making a decision is not straightforward, but it’s not overwhelmingly impossible either. \nOur baby-name-App searches and filters for you over 3000 names through a wide variety of search criteria. In addition it provides a good coverage of background knowledge of the names, which will help you in making the final choice. \n\nHere's how the App works\nBaby’s gender is the first step in narrowing down the choice of a name. In addition, the first name should sound good together with the surname. Enter the future baby’s surname and let our App search first names which will make a good match. \n\nA further instrument for a harmonious sounding full name is the length of the first name. You can play around with different options by clicking the “Further search criteria” and then you’ll get a better idea what you really want. The cultural origin of the name obviously relates to the sound of the name. For example German names and Irish names have distinctive sounds to them. If you have a preference for a particular cultural background, you can choose from a menu in the App. You can also search through biblical names. You can mark the names which you like with a star and make a list of favorites. With the help of that list you can further research the details of each name and share the information with other people. \n\nIf you already have a name in mind, you can find it from the alphabetical index and learn more about its cultural origin, the meaning of the name and how popular it is. As the popular Latin proverb states: “Nomen est omen!” – the name is an omen. \n\nThat said, we wish you good luck and hope you have fun when being on a quest for the perfect name for your baby.\n \nKirstin and Roman"

Each day's devotion is filled with practical advice and help from Joyce along with life-changing promises from God's Word that you can quickly and easily apply in your own life.\n\nThe world wants you to place your trust in your circumstances, your success, your talents and the opinions of others. But God's called you to rise above the world, and put your full trust in Him - to believe and apply what He's promised in His Word more than anything else.\n\nLiving this way won't just happen - you have to be intentional. But where do you begin? We all need help to make good choices, battle worry, overcome anxiety and keep a positive attitude. Using this devotional, readers will learn to grab hold of life this way, day by day, with trust in God.\n\nThis daily app has a devotion search feature, customized daily push notifications, and the ability to combine your favorite passages with images into beautiful shareable 'Quotos'!"

      "label": "** Children's Technology Review Editor's Choice\n\n“OOPS…” Blue Hat, Green Hat, Sandra Boynton’s famous and funny book, comes alive with sound and zestily ingenious interactivity. This wonderfully clever digital book app will surprise kids and grownups alike. Turkeys may also enjoy it, if they can ever figure out how to turn the dang thing on.\n\nThree earnest animals and one misguided turkey learn colors and clothes. Though admittedly, the turkey never quite gets the hang of it.\n\n“I have a particular fondness for Blue Hat, Green Hat. At age three, my son Devin had a surprisingly hearty laugh for a small person—a laugh that would make everyone else laugh. I created this book long ago specifically to elicit that belly-laugh from him. It was great fun to re-invent this book as an interactive e-book app, collaborating again with my endlessly clever Loud Crow friends. The digital dimension gave us so many terrific opportunities for adding theatrical flair to this spare yet decidedly Vaudeville book.” - Sandra Boynton\n\nFar beyond any e-book experience, the Blue Hat, Green Hat interactive book app has all the magic and appeal of a traditional pop-up book, offering lively interactivity and nifty discovery.\n\nThe third Sandra Boynton book app, all of them created in collaboration between Boynton Moo Media along with the award-winning developer Loud Crow Interactive. Blue Hat, Green Hat follows their wonderful top-selling debut, The Going To Bed Book app, and the glorious bestselling Moo, Baa, La La La! app\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Touch the animals to prompt them to move and respond.\n* Touch “OOPS” to cause a different surprise on each page.\n* Tilt your device to watch things slide and cascade.\n* Dress the turkey with colorful pop-in/pop-out clothes\n* Boynton has redrawn and recolored the original illustrations, and also added new touch-animations\n* Wonderful resonant and wry narration by British Invasion legend, Billy J. Kramer\n* Includes a original sounds and soundtrack, “William Mattel Overture,” a melody for toy crank-guitar, written by Sandra Boynton, performed by Michael Ford\n* Realistic page turning interactions just like the original board book\n* “The Big Guy Reads It” narration mode with word highlighting to help improve reading skills\n* Or “I want to read it myself” to hear individual words pronounced with the tap of a finger\n\nVisit us: www.loudcrow.com \nFollow us: twitter.com/loudcrowinc \nLike us: facebook.com/loudcrow"

The app contains all 366 readings from the best-selling book, one for each day of the year, helping you on your journey of self-care and recovery to a path of freedom and a lifetime of healing, hope, and happiness.\n\nEach daily reading focuses on a specific topic and ends with a related prayer or affirmation. Topics include: setting healthy boundaries, recognizing feelings, loving yourself, trusting your Higher Power, finding peace, and letting go of shame, guilt, sadness, anger, and worry. Also included are handy reference lists of the Twelve Steps of AA, the Twelve Traditions of AA, and the Twelve Steps of Al-Anon.\n\nWhen the app is opened each day, it will automatically show you that day’s reading. Choose a time for a daily notification reminding you to read, reflect, and meditate on that day’s reading and on your recovery. Open the app anytime you need to refocus.\n\nCodependency—the concept of losing oneself in the name of helping another—has rung true for millions around the globe, and can manifest for many reasons: a spouse, child, parent, or loved one addicted to alcohol or other drugs; a mentally or physically ill loved one; sexual addiction; abuse; or neglect. By integrating her own life experiences and fundamental recovery reflections, Melody Beattie helps readers take responsibility for their own pain and self-care as she encourages them to remember that each day is an opportunity for growth and renewal.\n\nFeatures:\nPRESS the “Today” button to access today’s reading.\nSWIPE forward or back to easily access more daily readings.\nSHARE the daily reading with friends by e-mail or text.\nBOOKMARK your favorite readings (press the star in the upper right-hand corner) and easily return to them (press the star in the bottom toolbar).\nSEARCH all 366 daily readings.\nRECEIVE a notification every day to remind you to read the daily meditation.\nJUMP to a specific reading using the calendar button.\nSET your font size using your device settings.\nCHOOSE between light or dark mode."

Our interactive book app version of my book manages to both retain the original board book experience, and add subtle and captivating dimension to it. It’s such wonderful fun. And oh!

Professional! Highly Recommended... finally the currency application I have been waiting for so long...\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"...I tried all other similar apps, and I am proud to announce that this app is simply the best of them all..\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Smart, intuitive and flexible!... slick interface with great functionality which further impresses with its great selection of currencies and immediate updates. Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

We will talk in detail about Currencies, Charts, Bulls & Bears, Short Selling,\n\nlearn how to read the Calendar of Economic events, which is imperative for Fundamental trading on Forex as well as other Financial marketplaces such as NYSE, London Stock Exchange, Futures Exchanges, and more.\n\nI will thoroughly explain how Forex Brokers work, so that you are able to easily separate Honest Brokers from the unreliable ones when you are ready to open a Real Trading account. I even include a FREE guide to selecting a Forex broker, based on my own experience of Real trading.\n\nI will also supply you with a Forex Market Hours wallpaper for YOUR timezone, allowing you to effortlessly monitor the activity of Global Forex Market participants throughout the day.\n\nThis app is for complete beginners and advance! All you need is an open mind and a passion to be successful!\n\nWhat is Forex?\n\nForex, also known as foreign exchange, FX, or currency trading, is a decentralized global market where all the world's currencies trade. The Forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world with an average daily trading volume exceeding $5 trillion. All the world's combined stock markets don't even come close to this. But what does that mean to you? Take a closer look at Forex trading and you may find some exciting trading opportunities unavailable with other investments.\n\nWhy Learn Forex Trading: Advantages Of Forex Trading\n\nThere are many benefits and advantages of Forex Trading for Beginners. Here are just a few reasons why so many people are choosing Forex Trading:\n\nNo commissions Forex Trading\n\nNo clearing fees, no exchange fees, no government fees, no brokerage fees. Most retail brokers are compensated for their services through something called the “bid/ask spread“.\n\nNo middlemen in Forex Trading\n\nSpot currency trading eliminates the middlemen and allows you to trade directly with the market responsible for the pricing on a particular currency pair.\n\nNo fixed lot size in Forex Trading\n\nIn spot Forex, you determine your own lot or position size. This allows traders to participate with accounts as small as $25.\n\n\nForex Trading is a 24-hour market\n\nThere is no waiting for the opening bell. From the Monday morning opening in Australia to the afternoon close in New York, the forex market never sleeps. This is awesome for those who want to trade on a part-time basis because you can choose when you want to trade: morning, noon, night, during breakfast, or in your sleep.\n\nNo one can corner the market in Forex Trading\n\nThe foreign exchange market is so huge and has so many participants that no single entity can control the market price for an extended period of time.\n\nLow Barriers to Entry\n\nYou would think that getting started as a currency trader would cost a ton of money. The fact is, when compared to trading stocks, options, or futures, it doesn’t. Online forex brokers offer “mini” and “micro” trading accounts, some with a minimum account deposit of $25.\n\nTopics Included in this App\n\n1- Introduction to Forex Trading to Beginner\n2- The Structure of the Forex Market\n3- Major Currencies & Trade System in Forex Trading\n4- Market Analysis in Forex Trading\n5- Type of Foreign Exchange Market in Forex Trading\n6- Benefits of Forex Trading\n7- Fundamental Market Forces in Forex Trading\n8- Technical Indicators in Forex Trading\n9- Pattern Study of Trends in Forex Trading\n10- Forex Trading Technical Strategy in Price Patterns\n11- Forex Trading Oscillator Divergences\n12- The Role of Inflation in Forex Trading\n13- The Commodity Connection in Forex Trading\n14- Position of Money Management in Forex Trading\n15- Foreign Exchange Risks in Forex Trading"

It takes advantage of price correlation between various Forex pairs. Currency strength is measured for 8 currencies (USD, JPY, EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, CHF & CAD) and is reported on a scale of 0 (weakest) to 10 (strongest). \n\nCurrency strength data provides the trader with important insights into the forces at play causing a move on a particular Forex pair. For example, if GBP/USD suddenly trends upwards following an economic news announcement (e.g. US Non-Farm Payroll), the currency strength values would immediately indicate whether the move was due to generalized GBP strength or USD weakness.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nStreaming currency strength data feed - fast updates, low latency. Accurate and reliable\n\n8 currencies and 4 currency strength time-frames. Currency strength resolution down to 1 min on lower time-frames.\n\nBar Chart. Multiple time-frames, history viewer feature, real-time max/min highlighting.\n\nLine Chart. For real-time and historical data. Multiple time-frames, zoom. Customizable currencies, gridlines etc.\n\nDark Mode support (requires IOS13+)\n\nMultiple bar chart color themes.\n\nAdjustable chart Time-Zone. Match the time-zone to your Forex charts.\n\nBuilt-in Help / User Guide. Detailed description of all features.\n\nPriority Support.

      "label": "Loan Calculator Pro is an easy to use financial calculator.  Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

      "label": "The forex market is available for trading 24 hours a day. However, this doesn’t mean it’s always active throughout the whole day. Most successful traders understand this and choose to trade during times when market activity is high and avoid times when trading is light. Spreads are tighter during these periods and currency movements backed up by high trading volume are more likely to follow through. \n\nForex Hours Pro provides a quick overview of the status and local time of major forex markets in the world. At those overlapping trading hours it is likely you will find the highest volume of trades and therefore more chances to win in the foreign currency exchange market. The status and local time are updated in real-time thus no refresh is required. \n\nIn addition, you can also choose to receive notifications/alerts when your favourite market open and closed. \n\nThis Pro version has no ads.\n\nJoin our facebook fan page. \nhttp://www.facebook.com/codingtrader \n\nFor technical support / enquiries, please email our technical support team at codingtrader.sg@gmail.com\n\nNote: \n\nThis application assumes local trading hours of 8:00 AM - 4:00 PM in each Forex market from Monday to Friday excluding holidays as most participants trade between these times in their local time zone. \n\nThe current version of Forex Hours Pro comes with the 5 major markets.  If there is a Forex market which you wish to be included in this app, do drop us an email for evaluation and we may include it in our next update.  =)\n\n******* IMPORTANT NOTE ******* \nPlease visit http://www.codingtrader.com to view the new screenshot for this new update."

Are you single, married, or share a bank account with another person?  This app is perfect for you!\n\nPerfect for reconciliation as well as anyone that has a Bank Account.  Simply keep track of each of your purchases directly with the app.  If you share an account, then this app allows you to reconcile with the other person to transfer all their purchases and update your remaining balance in your account!\n\nYou can now backup your transactions via email to .csv or .txt file and restore from a back up!\n\n---How it Works---\nPlease read instructions on the app before starting! (Both devices must have a beginning Deposit and at least one withdrawal)\n\nOne user is set to a 'primary' user.  This user will have the total remaining balance as well as all of their transactions.  The other person set to 'secondary'.\n\nWhen reconciling, the app connects the devices via bluetooth to move all 'secondary's' transactions to the 'primary' user.  This will update the remaining balance on the 'primary' user, and then send the new balance back to the 'secondary' user.\n\n----Highlights-------\n-Manage multiple accounts! NEW!!!\n-Shows a 'Total' Balance of all accounts NEW!!!\n-Select the currency for each account\n-Backup your transactions to .csv or .txt file!\n-Restore from a backup!\n-Search for transactions\n-Ability to add a lock screen\n-Changed how transactions are stored to help with users experiencing crashes.\n-Prompts user and asks if a transaction is the starting balance, if a starting balance has not been created yet.\n-Simple to use\n-Perfect for anyone to track their transactions, from checks to debit card purchases.\n-Wonderful for people sharing the same bank account.\n-Transfers all purchases to the 'primary' account and updates each remaining balance when reconciling.\n\n(Use for personal tracking of Bank Account balance only.

After entering your debts in the application, you can analyze how the choice of payment strategy or different extra amounts helps you pay off your debts sooner, and save on the total interest paid.  Debt Strategy supports multiple strategies such as:\n\n- Minimum Payments Only\n- Lowest Balances First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n- Highest Interest Rate First, with rollover of payments from paid off loans\n\nDebt Strategy helps you to take control of your debts. Pick one debt, either one with the lowest balance or one with the highest interest rate, and focus on paying it off first by paying a little more than the minimum. This will shave months off your debt. With your other debts, continue paying just the minimum. After you finish paying off the first debt, move on to the 2nd debt per your strategy. Roll over the amount you paid each month from your first debt to pay off this one. You will pay off the second debt even more quickly. Continue this strategy until all your debts are paid.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Ability to enter debts and track debts.\n- Ability to identify the best pay-off strategy, and perform what-if analysis with different additional amounts and pay-off strategies\n- Graphical view of how the debts will be paid off\n- Pie/Bar charts for debt break down by category, or remaining balance\n- Monthly payment schedule for each debt\n- Ability to enter payments during the life of the loan, and accurately track remaining balances\n- Payment reminders so you can make your payments on time\n- Ability to override the home currency\n- Option to email a report\n- Password protection"

You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods.

Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

From collectible film cameras to '80s vintage shirts to a set of tools, flippers keep products from ending up in landfills while finding them new, loving homes.\n\nWith Margin is a straightforward yet effective profit and loss estimator providing anyone on the go quick access to determine a find as a possible hit or miss. Utilizing fixed or percentage-based costs, quickly enter your reasonably educated guess for the amount it could sell. Next, subtract shipping, item cost, marketplace fees, and payment processing fees (if applicable). If profitable based on your industry knowledge, you can quickly act upon it.\n\nTip: While using the Custom calculator, tap the percent (%) icon to turn the line item value into a percentage rather than a fixed cost; this is useful for percentage-based fees.\n\nThank you for downloading With Margin!"

This involves the preparation of financial statements available for public consumption. Stockholders, suppliers, banks, employees, government agencies, business owners, and other stakeholders are examples of people interested in receiving such information for decision making purposes.\n\nFinancial accountancy is governed by both local and international accounting standards. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting used in any given jurisdiction. It includes the standards, conventions and rules that accountants follow in recording and summarizing and in the preparation of financial statements. On the other hand, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is a set of international accounting standards stating how particular types of transactions and other events should be reported in financial statements. IFRS are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). With IFRS becoming more widespread on the international scene, consistency in financial reporting has become more prevalent between global organisations.\n\nWhile financial accounting is used to prepare accounting information for people outside the organization or not involved in the day-to-day running of the company, management accounting provides accounting information to help managers make decisions to manage the business.\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are designed as a common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. \nInternational Accounting Standards (IAS), while standards issued by IASB are called IFRS. IAS were issued between 1973 and 2001 by the Board of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)."

      "label": "It is generally through a stock price-earnings ratio to determine whether it is worth the purchase price, but there is a big problem, price-earnings ratio does not reflect the pace of development of an enterprise, can only reflect its current profitability, it can not fully reflect a stock value.\nStock Intrinsic Value Calculator is based on the book \"Buffettology\", that lets you from complicated financial calculators and  a lot of tedious formula calculation.\nStock Intrinsic Value Calculator requires data input, are publicly available data on many sites can easily be found. The stock you are interested in using this valuation model to measure it, can provide a very good reference.\nOf course, you might say, how about the case that stock data itself has fake? Therefore, we recommend that you look at the Price-to-Sales Ratio(P/S or PSR) of the stock, the stock P/S is too high, or the possibility of financial fraud is very large, or is pushed stock prices too high.\nIn practice, we should also consider a stock's capitalization, small-cap stocks rose  fast (though falling fast too), but in general, if the valuation results almost, prefer small-cap stocks, in general , the proceeds will be significantly much better.\nRobust stock-picking strategy : trading below intrinsic value + branding + small stock capitalization\nAny stock valuation models, can not be perfect precision, but the \"Stock Intrinsic Value Calculator\", would be a very good reference.\n\n“A general definition of intrinsic value would be that value which is justified by the facts—e.g. assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects. In the usual case, the most important single factor determining value is now held to be the indicated average future earning power. Intrinsic value would then be found by first estimating this earning power, and then multiplying that estimate by an appropriate ‘capitalization factor’”.   – Graham\n\n“Intrinsic value is an all-important concept that offers the only logical approach to evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses. Intrinsic value can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.”  - Buffett\n\n“The calculation of intrinsic value, though, is not so simple. As our definition suggests, intrinsic value is an estimate rather than a precise figure… two people looking at the same set of facts… will almost inevitably come up with at least slightly different intrinsic value figures.” - Buffett\n\nBuffettology:\nThe book, Buffettology, is a fantastic resource, primarily written by Warren Buffett’s former daughter-in-law, Mary Buffett. The co-author, David Clark, is a long-time friend of the Buffett family. Since these authors probably have some special insight into how Warren Buffet privately analyzes stocks.\n\nBuffettology outlines a few different methods to determine the value of a stock and whether or not it is a good buy. Two of the most popular methods revolve around “Earnings Yield” and “Future Price Based on Past Growth.”\n\nCompound interest:\nCompound interest is interest added to the principal of a deposit or loan so that the added interest also earns interest from then on. This addition of interest to the principal is called compounding. A bank account, for example, may have its interest compounded every year: in this case, an account with $1000 initial principal and 20% interest per year would have a balance of $1200 at the end of the first year, $1440 at the end of the second year, $1728 at the end of the third year, and so on.\n\nWarren Buffett is a living testimony to the miracle of compound interest - in this case with a sustained high growth rate over an amazingly long period of time. Compound interest - along with his frugal ways and unique investment skills - has made him one of the world's richest people.\n\nWarning: For Reference Only. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!"

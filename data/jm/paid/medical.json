In just ONE app there is 1) a gestational age calculator, 2) an ultrasound biometric calculator, 3) a fetal weight calculator, 4) a list of key weeks and trimesters, 5) an age-adjusted risk table for trisomy 21 and aneuploidy, 6) a BMI calculator, and NOW 7) an Apple Watch app is included with your purchase!\n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 is a state-of-the-art gestational age calculator (also known as an obstetric or pregnancy wheel) that is used every day by doctors, obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and pregnant women. The OB Wheel Pro 7 is a professional tool that replaces the need for multiple apps and it greatly enhances the functionality of those worn-out cardboard wheels without compromise. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7 accurately determines the estimated delivery date (EDD), or due date, of a pregnancy based on the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or from the date of conception, or from a known gestational age (GA) on a known date, e.g. from an ultrasound measurement, or from fetal biometry like Crown-Rump Length (CRL), Femur Length (FL), and BiParietal Diameter (BPD). Additionally, for appropriate gestational ages, The The OB Wheel Pro 7 estimates fetal weight and displays the number of days completed and remaining. \n\nThe OB Wheel Pro 7, besides calculating GA from fetal ultrasound biometrics, enables clinicians to also calculate Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) from FL, BPD, Head Circumference (HC), and Abdominal Circumference (AC) using the most appropriate published reference formula using the maximum and most appropriate parameters.\n\nPrenatal care providers know that there are key gestational ages where testing or interventions are needed. The OB Wheel Pro 7 lets providers see at a glance when these items should be scheduled.\n\nFEATURES\n• Includes Apple Watch app! \n• Gestational Age Calculator from LMP, EDD, Conception Date for any reference date\n• Gestational Age calculated from specific date and gestational age (e.g. ultrasound)\n• Gestational Age Calculator using fetal biometrics (CRL, FL, BPD)\n• Fetal Weight Calculator using HC, AC, FL, BPD\n• Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator\n• Age-Adjusted Risk Table for Trisomy 21 and aneuploidy\n• List of key completed weeks during pregnancy\n• Pregnancy days completed and remaining, and dates for each trimester\n• Remembers last-used EDD\n\n\nPRO TIPS: \n• To enter Gestational Age, CRL, FL, or BPD for a specific date (like for an ultrasound exam), tap \"Today\", enter the desired date, then tap on the button displaying the gestational age to change that button to display options for entering a specific GA, CRL, FL, and BPD. \n• When using the GA calculator, double-tap a date to change the value to the current date.\n• When using the EFW calculator, double-tap a value to clear the value of the selected parameter."

Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

See daily, weekly and monthly increases or decreases in activity. Understand your baby better and keep on top of things.\n\nKEEP IN SYNC\nInvite your partner or a caregiver to share in the tracking or to review progress. And if you have multiple devices of your own, sync between these too. Running timers started on one device can be stopped from another device too enabling you to easily share tracking.\n\nAT-A-GLANCE BABY STATUS\nAt the top of the screen you’ll quickly see when your baby last fed, slept and was changed or go to the log screen for detailed history.\n\nFURTHER DETAILS:\n\n+ Nursing - pause or switch sides with a single tap.

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

The guidelines articles, as published in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, as well as the comprehensive risk estimates, can be accessed through https://www.asccp.org/guidelines.  \n\nThese evidence-based management guidelines, initially developed in 2019, came together through a consensus process of 19 organizations. The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app."

A detailed manual with 14 chapters is an ideal companion if you are a medical student, radiology resident, radiographer, a medic on the ward or preparing for board exams. It teaches the beginner (and perhaps not so much of a beginner) the technique of interpreting a chest radiograph. Over 70 flash cards on specific conditions provide short and succinct information, ideal when that odd looking film shows up on the screen. Unlike a traditional book, each condition is provided with multiple example images for better understanding.\n\nThanks to the beautiful high resolution screen, iCXR virtually turns your device to a mini PACS work station. Zoom the image by using familiar pinch gestures, use built in tools to change contrast and brightness and invert the image for a near real life experience. Over 100 detailed pictorial and text annotations superimposed on the images help better understanding. You can turn off the annotations to appreciate the findings better.\n\niCXR – The modern chest radiograph reference.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Works on both iPhone and iPad with a single purchase\n \n- No internet connection required\n\n- Largest chest radiograph library on the iphone \n\n- High quality zoomable radiographs\n\n- Zoomable text and pictorial annotations overlaid on the image that can be toggled\n\n- Multiple examples per condition\n\n- Links from text to appropriate images\n\n- Image manipulation tools that simulate a PACS work station\n\n- Manual to teach chest radiograph interpretation\n\n- Flash cards for quick reference"

ObWheel is useful for expectant parents as well as obstetricians, family physicians, nurses, midwives, and students. It uses the date of Last Menstrual Period (LMP) to calculate Estimated Due Date (EDD) and Gestational Age (GA). No more imprecise paper wheels - this tool is always at hand, in your pocket!\n\nWe've separated the outer and inner wheels to make this easy-to-use. Spin the green wheel to set the LMP date. Spin the purple wheel to browse important milestones, and to calculate the gestational age on a specific date (displayed in the middle).\n\nPrefer to enter dates manually? No problem. Select \"Set\" and choose dates by LMP, EDD, or GA on a specific date. Use the \"Info\" screen to see important dates (trimesters, testing and windows) and information on fetal biometry reference ranges (Lessoway) based on current gestational age.\n\nNeed to calculate the EDD from a dating ultrasound report? Rotate the purple wheel until the GA shown matches the GA on the ultrasound report. Then, rotate the green wheel until the date matches the date of the ultrasound. The EDD will be displayed below. Alternatively, input the GA and ultrasound date manually in the \"Set\" screen.\n\nObWheel is a universal app and works on the iPhone and iPad! We are continually working to improve ObWheel, and appreciate your feedback."

Also with your blood pressure readings in Apple Health, you may enable other apps to use and share that data with your healthcare professionals.\n\nMain features:\n- Quickly save your blood pressure and pulse to Apple Health\n- Weekly averages of blood pressure with configurable color highlights\n- Reminders to take your blood pressure daily\n- Share measurements with email (in HTML table and CSV formats)\n- Save measurements using your Apple Watch\n\nDisclaimer: \nFast BP is intended as a tool to keep track of and share blood pressure measurements utilizing Apple Health.

      "label": "Speech Trainer 3-D is a unique application created specifically to help individuals with speech-sound disorders and English language learners. Speech Trainer 3-D provides an animated video model for both consonants and vowel sounds. With both a side and front view, Speech Trainer 3-D provides 32 English language sounds: 23 consonants and 8 vowels. Designed by a certified speech-language pathologist, Speech Trainer 3-D is perfect for those individuals struggling with sound production and for use by SLPs, special educators, and parents alike.\nPurpose\nSpeech Trainer 3-D was created to be used as a therapy tool to assist individuals in correctly producing target sounds. Speech Trainer incorporates both an animated video of the speech sound as well as a systematic breakdown for describing the movements necessary for each sound. Both video modeling and video prompting are useful for many individuals when learning new skills1. \nIn addition to the animated video model, Speech Trainer 3-D uses the camera function built into the iPad 2 and higher to allow the learner to see a side-by-side picture of the model and his or her own face making the sound. Incorporating the built-in camera allows the professional to utilize both a visual and a tactile prompt for the client, which may in turn, encourage longer productions and improve the muscle coordination needed for speech2. \nHow to Use\nSpeech Trainer 3-D is designed to be used individually or in group practice. Once the app is loaded, the user can choose whether to work on consonants or vowels. When a phoneme type has been selected, the app will open with a phoneme bar along the top of the page and the side-view of a model of the speech mechanism. For consonants, the user can simply slide the selection bar sideways to access all of the consonant sounds. When the phoneme is selected, a “play” arrow is tapped and the video model moves while the sound is produced. To hear the systematic breakdown of movements, a double “fast-forward” arrow is pushed. A square will surround the area being discussed. Subsequent taps on the double arrow will move to the next prompt. \nThe app opens in a default side-view; however, a frontal view is available. In this view, the speech-mechanism model is replaced with a person modeling the sounds. The app also provides an audio example of 2-4 words for each sound. \nThe iPad camera is activated when the iPad is rotated to the landscape position. At that time, the user will see their image in the camera beside the avatar. The user will then be able to use the video modeling to make encourage accurate production of sounds. \n\nCustomization\nSpeech Trainer 3-D allows the user to specify which sound in the English language to target. Transitioning between multiple sounds is easily accomplished with the tap of a button. Changing from the side medical model of the speech mechanism to the mirror like human model is done with a quick tap. Finally, adding a self-monitoring component is encouraged by simply rotating the iPad and engaging the iPad’s built-in camera.\n\nFeatures\n•Full color medical model of the speech mechanism\n•Systematic breakdown of each phoneme with video\n•32 English phonemes: 23 consonants and 8 vowels\n•Both side and frontal views for demonstrating the sound\n•Built-in camera feature to encourage self-monitoring\n\nSpeech Trainer 3D demonstrates the sounds in two views: Front and Side View. Speech Trainer uses the International Phonetics Alphabet, which is the best way to represent each sound. \nSpeech Trainer has 30 sounds represented; 23 consonants and 7 vowels."

After gallons of coffee and many sleepless nights spent pouring over notes and textbooks, you still wonder if you’re going to make it.\n\nPreparing for a career in medicine requires learning a daunting amount of information and technique.

That’s where Physical Exam Essentials comes to the rescue. \n\nThis application lets you look up selected terms, view illustrations of physical exam maneuvers, read the Clinical Correlates to discover the significance of certain findings and find descriptions of special tests. Physical Exam Essentials even offers a guide for describing your findings.\n\nPhysical Exam Essentials is not a comprehensive medical reference. Rather, it is a handy overview resource that is perfect for medical students, pre-meds, health professionals and anyone who practices or has an interest in medicine.

That’s not all, though. Just look at some of the other features you get!\n\n* Attractive, easy to navigate interface\n* Look up certain selected terms in Wikipedia, Google, or Google images\n * Pictures in each section help to illustrate physical exam maneuvers\n * Includes \"Clinical Correlates\" which highlight the significance of certain physical exam findings\n * \"Presentation Tips\" included to help you describe your findings \n* Includes descriptions of special tests that are not usually performed in a routine physical exam\n * Content and images added and updated regularly \n\nForget carrying those heavy textbooks everywhere you go.

Setting the delay to 0 ms will still have the delay between 50 ms and 75 ms.\n\nThe DAF is very suitable for those who want to practice speak exercises, to reduce stuttering by up to 80% instantly, or those who simply want to prepare for a speech.\n\nTo use the DAF it is necessary to be equipped with wired or bluetooth headphones with microphone."

      "label": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!"

      "label": "Vagusvit is your professional respiratory coach for strengthening the vagus nerve or rather your rest and digest nervous system. A permanently impaired vagus nerve contributes sooner or later to organic disorders. The easiest method to strengthen the vagus nerve is to practice a guided respiration under a special respiratory rhythm. Studies from around the world have proven that guided respiration is the ideal foundation for a gentle, fast, yet effective therapy that strengthens the autonomic nervous system and especially the vagus nerve. Life can move pretty fast at times, by enabling respiratory training, anywhere, anytime, you can conveniently help to prevent stress-related functional disorders, by increasing resistance to stress, and adding resilience to the body.\n\nVagusvit enables you to breathe a healthy, vagus nerve stimulating respiratory rhythm. Vagusvit has been developed to work quickly and easily. With our easy to-use interface, our intuitive software is the ideal application accross all age groups. Vagusvit contains seven respiratory rhythms, including the rhythm of 6 breaths per minute. This rhythm has been integrated into the German National Healthcare Guidelines, as an inhalation of 4 seconds and an exhalation of 6 seconds has shown the greatest stimulation of the vagus nerve. Faster respiratory rhythms have been included for users not immediately able to breathe the standard rhythms, such as in COPD or asthma patients. This allows you to slowly approach the optimal rhythm. Additionally, two slower rhythms, for slower breathing users, allow the possibility of an even greater stimulation of the vagus nerve."

Some examples are: R.I.C.E., trapezius, and latissimus dorsi. It is to be used in the medical and nursing fields. This systematic approach to word building and term comprehension is based on the concept of: (1) word roots, (2) prefixes, and (3) suffixes. The 'rootword' is a term derived from a source language such as Greek or Latin and usually describes a body part. The prefix can be added in front of the term to modify the word root by giving additional information about the location of an organ, the number of parts, or time involved. Suffixes are attached to the end of a word root to add meaning such as condition, disease process, or procedure.\n\nInvest in your Success Now, Your investment in knowledge, professionalism & expertise is durable and High added value  & High return investment.\n\nThis app is also suitable for  students, researchers, resident, doctors, Anatomy & physiology specialists, nurses and medical professionals and of course Medical lecturers, teachers and professors.\nGet a better score in your  USMLE  (step1, step2  CS & CK), PANCE, MCAT, DAT, COMLEX,CNA, OAT, NBDE,  or PCAT exam, and the most important  is to fall in love with the material, it worth all the attention.\nNational League for Nursing Pre-Admission Exam (NLN PAX-RN/PN)\nTest of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS)\nHealth Occupations Basic Entrance Test (HOBET)\nHealth Education Systems, Inc Exam (HESI) A2\nPsychological Services Bureau Registered Nursing School Aptitude Exam\nPsychological Services Bureau Aptitude for Practical Nursing Exam\n\n\nThis educational & medical application is intended to NP, CNA, PAX, RN, and also for:\nANP - Adult Nurse Practitioner\nFNP - Family Nurse Practitioner\nA-GNP - Adult-Gero Primary Nurse Practitioner\nANP-BC Adult Nurse Practitioner\nFNP-BC Family Nurse Practitioner\nPNP-BC Pediatric Nurse Practitioner\nACNP-BC Acute Care Nurse Practitioner\nGNP - BC Gerontological Nurse Practitioner\nPMHNP-BC Adult Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse Practitioner\nPMHNP-BC Family Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse Practitioner\nCNRN®\nSCRN®\nand also for USMLE, COMLEX, ANCC Certification Center, TEAS, HESI A2, NET, DET, PSB/HOAE, PAX-RN, HOBET, PAX RN, PSB.

      "label": "《神农本草经》系统地总结了古代医家等各方面的用药经验，对已经掌握的药物知识进行了一次全面而系统的整理。全书共计收录了365种药物，正好与一年365日相合，这倒并非巧合，而是作者有意为之的结果。事实上，当时掌握的药物数量已经远超此数，但由于受到术数思想的影响，所以从中选取了365种药物，“法三百六十五度，一度应一日，以成一岁”。\n《神农本草经》不止进行了药物的搜集工作，还有意识地对所收药物进行了分门别类工作，将365种药物按照上、中、下分为三类，这被称为“三品分类法”。分类的依据主要是药物的性能功效。\n《本经·序录》中即言：“上药一百二十种为君，主养命以应天，无毒，久服不伤人，”如人参、甘草、地黄、大枣等；“中药一百二十种为臣，主养性以应人，无毒有毒，斟酌其宜。”，需判别药性来使用，如百合、当归、龙眼、黄连、麻黄、白芷、黄芩等；“下药一百二十五种为佐使，主治病以应地，多毒，不可久服。”，如大黄、乌头、甘遂、巴豆等。\n《神农本草经》中也蕴含着丰富而深刻的药物理论，由此奠定了药物学的理论构架。此部分内容主要见于序录部分，相当于全书总论，虽然文字并不长，只有十三条，但已经涵盖了药物学的各个方面。\n以药物配伍为例，《神农本草经》中提出了君臣佐使的组方原则。所谓君臣佐使，本为社会中的不同阶层成员，有不同的职能与等级，药物学将其借用来说明药物在配伍中的不同角色，如上品药为君药，中品药为臣药，而下品药为佐使药。在组方时，应该充分考虑药物的特性，方中既要有君药、臣药，还要有起协助作用的佐使之药。其比例可按照一君、二臣、三佐、五使或一君、三臣、九佐使的原则来处理。\n在药物配伍中，两味或两味以上的药物用在一个方剂中，相互之间会产生不同的反应：有的药物共同使用能发挥更大的功效，有的两药相遇一方会减小另一方的药性；有的药可以制约另一种药物的毒性；有的两种药品本身均无毒，但如果两药相遇则会产生很大的毒性，不能同用等。《神农本草经》中共总结了七种关系，包括单行、相须、相使、相畏、相恶、相反、相杀等，认为对此“七情”要“合和视之”，这便是“七情合和”的配伍原则。\n《神农本草经》中对于所收录的各种药物的功效和主治疾病都进行了简要的记载与描述，这无疑是早期临床药学宝贵经验的总结。长期临床实践和现代研究都证明《神农本草经》中对于所载药物的功效认识大部分是正确的，其中许多药物至今仍然在临床广泛应用，比如人参补益、黄连止痢、麻黄定喘、常山截疟、大黄泻下等。而且各种药物主治疾病的种类也非常广泛，约有170余种，包括了内、外、妇、儿、五官等科疾病。此外，《神农本草经》中对于药物的性味、产地与采制、炮制方法，乃至用药原则和服药方法等都有涉及，极大地丰富了药物学的知识体系。"

      "label": "Sometimes just giving a hint or context is all your listener needs to understand you. The first letter or two. The general topic. AlphaTopics is the perfect AAC app for people whose natural speech is not always clear. \n\nStop wasting time navigating to the right word or typing it out. Get your point across faster by touching just the first few letters of the words you say. Give your listener context by starting the conversation with the topic. Write it out with your finger or draw a picture. Don’t let overly complicated apps slow you down. \n\nTactus Therapy, a trusted name in speech therapy apps, brings you a new take on a classic communication tool.  AlphaTopics includes 3 AAC communication boards loaded with features:\n\n1) Letter Board\n- 26 letters in alphabetical order or 2 variations of frequency order\n- 10 single digits allow you to express any number \n- Vowels highlighted and aligned for faster navigation\n- Natural or automated speech reads out the name of each letter or number\n- Yes, no, question, smiley, space, and backspace buttons for prosody and function\n\n2) Topic Board \n- Fully customizable text you can re-order \n- Voice output with adjustable speech rate\n- Two sizes of grid to display 12 or 24 topics\n- Pre-filled with functional topics for adults\n\n3) Whiteboard\n- Write or draw on the screen\n- 6 colors and 4 widths\n- Export to Photos or e-mail\n\nWhen used together, alphabet and topic boards have been scientifically shown to make the speech of people with motor speech disorders far more understandable. Combined with the whiteboard, these tools help people with aphasia express themselves more clearly with self-cueing and strategy use.\n\nStroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, and motor neuron disease are all conditions that can impair speech production.\n\nPointing to the first letter in each word not only gives the listener more information about the word, it also encourages the speaker to slow down and separate words, actually making the words clearer! Using alphabet supplementation, studies show intelligibility of sentences improves 25% on average.\n\nPointing to the topic before speaking narrows the range of possibilities for the listener, giving context. Studies show using a topic cue improves word understanding by an average of 28%. Topics can also be used by people with aphasia, a language disorder, to help pinpoint the intended message.\n\nAdditional Features:\n*Adjustable settings for visual, physical, language, and cognitive impairments\n*Works with built-in scanning and guided access\n*4 color schemes\n*Pick which board comes up when you start the app\n*Export any board you've customized to print or share\n\n\"People whose speech is hard to understand often just want to provide extra clues to their listener and don’t require all the features of a comprehensive AAC app.  It’s terrific that we now have an app that provides this level of support on a mobile platform.” - Lois Turner, SLP & AAC specialist\n\nVisit tactustherapy.com for more information on how to use this app, the evidence to support this form of AAC, and a day-by-day account of how this app was made."

      "label": "Easy EDSS Score allows a quick and simple evaluation of the EDSS score for MS patients.\n\nMain features:\n\n- Easy rating of functional system scores:\nFor each function, enter a score manually or answer a few questions about neurological exam to obtain an automatized rating.\n\n- Conversion of visual and bowel & bladder scores:\nDepending on versions, it is sometimes recommended to convert visual and bowel & bladder scores to lower values when determining the EDSS step. This option can be activated if needed.\n\n- Interference between pyramidal and cerebellar function assessment:\nAs required in the EDSS assessment, if the pyramidal score is greater than 3, an alert will ask you whether there is an interference with the evaluation of cerebellar function. In this case, the cerebral score can be rated but will not be included when determining the EDSS step.\n\nEasy EDSS Score is based on the EDSS score published by Kurtzke et al. (bibliographic reference is included in the app)"

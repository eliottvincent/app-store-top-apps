This is a full featured complete SDA eHymnal lyrics that are ultra sharp and clear. Contains all of the 695 hymns from the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal® plus many more from the \"old\" hymnal and other choruses. Also has all of the responsive readings. No internet connection is needed to use this hymnal after installation. \n\nThe user interface has a clean look with no ads, and very easy to use. You can quickly and easily find the hymn that you want either by selecting from the alphabetical index of hymn titles and first lines, the numerical index of hymn numbers based on the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal®, or your own bookmark list. There is a full featured bookmark list for you to add songs that you need for quick access. Use the search feature to quickly search for words in the title or first line, or just enter a hymn number to jump directly to that hymn. You can also swipe left or right to go to the next or previous song just like turning pages in the printed hymnal. But what is even better is that the swipe turning sequence can either be in numerical hymn number order, alphabetical hymn title order, or bookmark list order. Zoom in for larger texts both in portrait or landscape orientations. \n\nGod has given me two talents-music and computer. I have been a church pianist and organist for several decades, and professionally, I am a computer professor. So putting these two talents together, I have personally written this app to be a blessing to others. I hope that you will like it and be blessed by it. I would love to hear from you to tell me how I can improve this app. \n\nThis app is neither endorsed by nor affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church®. \n\nPlease email support@mygadgets2.com if you have any problems whatsoever in using this app."

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

      "label": "XAir Monitor Mixer is a personal monitor mixer for select Behringer and Midas digital mixers. It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3. Mix away. :)\n\nIf you have feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, please visit the forums at xairmonitormixer.tetzfiles.com or send an email to xairmonitormixer@tetzfiles.com.\n\nNote: support for mixers other than XR18 was recently added. If you run into any issues, please let us know. Ensuring proper compatibility with all supported mixers is our top priority."

      "label": "\"... the sound quality blew us away.\"- Gearburn.com\nMusic player with the most powerful and acurate equalizer in the app store as well as the most advanced playlist controls.\n\n+ Play music directly from your Music Library including podcasts and music video (audio only)\n+ Adjust the powerful parametric equalizer by moving the seven control points or type in the values directly.\n+ Adjust the EQ curve for your left and right ear separately (now extends from -30 to + 30 dB. Use the StereoEQ setting for that)\n+ Select from over 10 presets or save your own. You can even share them via email and import presets from other people via email.\n+ Full background support including remote control (from docks, headsets, car stereos)\n+ Visualize the music with the spectrum analyzer.\n+ Use AirPlay to listen on your AppleTV, or your Bluetooth headsets and even a dock. \n+ Use the pre-amp slider to adjust the overall boost or cut. Make sure to turn the slider down if you experience distortion. Use the auto-normalizer function to prevent clipping automatically and have the best dynamic range possible with your eq curve. (on/off in settings)\n+ Curve screen: curve redraws as controllers are dragged. Pinch to modify Q. Three stage clipping signal on preamp slider. Keyboard entry for pre-amp. Twitter/Facebook/Weibo integration to share your current EQ curve. Bypass.\n+ Crossfade between songs. Make sure to stop the music before changing the crossfade time slider.\n+ Now playing screen includes repeat (all, single no repeat) button and shuffles like the music app. Improved stability of on the fly modifications of the playlist. Add more songs to the playlist at any time. Sort playlist alphabetically.\n+ Music selection is very similar to default music app.\n+ Turn landscape to display the frequency analyzer. \n+ Built in sleep timer to stop Equalizer after a certain period if time. \n+ Crossfeed option to blend audio between channels\n+ Apple Watch support for eq curve selection incl. complications\n\nKNOWN ISSUES:\nNo known issues. please contact support if you have any problems.\n\nCOPY-PROTECTED MUSIC:\nEqualizer will not play copy-protected (DRM). You need to convert DRM songs. Apple Music Streaming uses copy-protected songs.\n\niCLOUD:\nOnly the Apple Music app can manage songs in iCloud (iTunes Match). You will need to make sure the songs are downloaded to your device to listen and enhance them via Equalizer. If you want to stream and eq your music, you can try our other app: CloudEQ. It allows you to stream and eq music from SoundCloud and your Dropbox account without the need for storage on your device.\n\nFrom the reviews:\n\nEXCELLENT PROGRAM\nI connect my iphone 4 to a car audio system, with the application the music began to sound incomparably better ....\nA little clear interface, but to understand it and understand need no more than 5-10 minutes. -- P_S_B_\n***\nLOVE IT\nThis is the EQ I have been looking for, and because of bad ratings I almost passed on it! I consider myself an aspiring audiophile and have the equipment -- Klipsch, Sunfire, Nottingham, Denon, Paradigim, etc. -- (and debt) to back it up. This EQ performs flawlessly and is very easy to use. It enhanced my music dramatically. Yes, dramatically! Just make sure you are running the recommended IOS, as the developer suggests. -- J. Paul DiMaggio\n***\n\n\nPLEASE if you have concerns or encounter problems with the app: post on http://www.audioforge.ca and we will explain how things work, until you can use all the features of the app to the fullest. Thank you"

Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

While a chord is played, related chords are highlighted so you can easily find chord sequences that progress smoothly. Once you found a nice chord sequence, you can drag and drop chords into your song to build your composition upon it.\nIf you want to start your song with a melody and find a suitable chord progression, you can do that just as well: select notes and tap the search icon to show chords that match your melody fragment. It's real fun to experiment, seeing how different harmonic contexts affect the perception of the same melodic fragment.\n\n\nCreate Beautiful Melodies and Flowing Chord Progressions\n\nIn the piano roll, notes that are in harmony as well as the chords' root notes are highlighted. This makes it super easy to create leads, arpeggios and basslines and to experiment with different chord voicings to let your chord progressions flowing nicely. \n\n\nIntuitive Editing\n\nA simple, yet feature rich and context-aware user interface helps you build up your ideas into whole songs:\nGroup sections into song parts and arrange them via drag and drop. \nDuplicate, copy and paste, playback selected notes.\n\n\nFile Export\n\nExport and share your creations with audio file export.\nEdit your song in other Apps with MIDI-file export.\n\n\nUse your Favorite Instrument Apps\n\nIt's just more fun to explore and create with those awesome Instrument Apps that are available in the App Store: Klimper supports Inter-App-Audio Instruments like Animoog and Model 15 as well as Audio Unit Instruments like Ripplemaker and Mersenne.\n\n\nVideo Tutorials\n\nThe included tutorial will help you getting started.

      "label": "The MKSensation Xtreme is a continuation of our famous MKSensation plugin library. At its core it represents the highest quality and the most accurate sampled representation of the classic MKS-20 piano module. You see, coming from a gospel musicians background this MKS sound is a staple of the gospel sound and has been featured in some of the top gospel albums throughout the years. For years you would see gospel musician’s rack filled with the MKS-20 module and a ton of other vintage racks such as the JV-Series, Motifs, and other auxiliary brass, strings, and bell sounds. This would create a complex and massive MIDI setup of the thickest stacked sounds imaginable with the ability to control the levels of each on the fly for a very fluid and dynamic concert experience with minimal sound switching, because the layers can be easily controlled with one or two controllers. So what we did was recreate this entire experience in one app to replace decades of modules.  \n\nNext is the absolute incredible amount of stacking and control you have. With the advent of more powerful iPads and now the new M1, MKSensation Xtreme is equivalent to 8 Pure Synth Platinums. Meaning, you have the ability to have separate control over AMP, Filter, Control, LFO, and effects per sound slot. In addition to 8-insert effects slots with up to 5-effects per slot, you get a Global and a Master effects slot and each effects bus can be controlled from the Red faders. And of course with all of our apps, everything can be controlled via MIDI learn and \n\nSecondly, with the emphasis on live performance, we have added the ability to not only use each sound button for our own sounds, but you can host your own AUv3 sounds and effects. Yes, you already love the sounds of our MKSensation X, but now combine all of those capabilities with hosting your own modules inside of the app itself. In fact, even if you never used our sounds, the hosting abilities alone are a game changer. And yes, you can run your AUv3 instruments through our filters, AMP, LFO, and Mod section as well. \n\niPad Version vs Desktop\n\nThe iPad version is identical to the desktop version as far as features, synthesis, and functionality. The only difference is in sound: We removed the second version of the MKS sounds, so that there is only one main version of the MKS soundest, instead of two different versions on the desktop. The quality is the same. \n\nGeneral Specs\n\n• 12 GB Lossless Compression)\n• 23,419 Samples\n• 362 Sampled Sounds\n• 21 Analog Modeled Wavetables\n• 14 Analog VA Waveforms\n• 74 Presets\n• 26 High Quality Effects Featuring Overloud’s VKFX \n\nHighlights\n\n• Store and stream sounds internally or on external hard rive\n• Ability to Load AUv3 in place of Sound Slots\n• 8-Fully independent Sound Sources with their own independent (AMP, Filter, LFO, Mod, and effects)\n• Seamless Sound Switching\n• Two versions of Power Grand\n• Live-Set Mode with MIDI CC Program Change\n• Dedicated Mute and Solo on the buttons\n• Dedicated Split Screen\n• All knobs, sliders, and buttons are MIDI Learnable\n• Two different MIDI CC Program Change modes for quickly switching to presets via your controller \n• 2-Second max load times per set. \n• Ability to Receive on Separate MIDI channels per sound for multi-timbral stacks and layers\n• Global Mictotune, Transpose, Octave, and Velocity Curve. \n• Dedicated large volume sliders on front of interface. \n• Ability to Copy/Paste Single or All parameters across sound-sources\n\nDevice Requirements:\n\n----------------\n▪ 2GHz ARM Processor Recommended - iPad Pro 12.9 and 9.7 in, iPad 5th Gen, iPad Pro 12.9 in.

Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

Still a must buy for ear training.\n\nGuy *****\n\nYou guys deserve 1000000 stars thank you\n\nEverything You Need ****\n \nIt took a while for me to appreciate this app. It wasn't until I had a bit of ear training done that I could see the limitations in other apps and how this one would take me further and teach more of what I could actually use versus simpler apps. Once I could hear intervals up to an octave and major vs minor chords, this app had plenty more for me to study.

It currently does not include Xtra radio stations.\n\nStarPlayrX organizes channels within categories. SPX groups these categories by type. All the talk channels are located together under the Talk heading. Also, the All category is located under Other header towards the bottom.\n\nEach category groups channels logically. For instance all the rock channels are located together with the Rock category and specific artist channels are in the Artists category. Categories and their channels are subject to change at any time.\n\nThe user interface for StarPlayrX is simple, clean, well organized and most of all easy to use. The goal of StarPlayrX is to enhance your SiriusXM satellite radio streaming experience.\n\nStarPlayrX runs in the foreground or background and uses very few resources to run. Artist and song info is available on the lock screen. If StarPlayrX is interrupted for a phone call, it will do its best to restart the stream after the phone call is over. SPX also mixes well with Apple Maps audio."

      "label": "The secret of all successful singers is daily Vocal Warm Ups. Whether you’re a pop star, rock star, classical opera or karaoke singer, you need to perform daily vocal warm ups.\n\nYou need to care for your voice. It's your key to success.\nVocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos gives you the power to take control of your voice anytime, anywhere. With this app you will improve your tone, breath control and stamina.\n\nLet's face it; we all need a little assistance when it comes to improving our tone, breath control and stamina. And with constant upgrades to the software and course material, you can keep up to date with the latest singing techniques, trends, all in this premium app.\n\n***** It's like having a vocal coach in your pocket! *****\n\nYou can warm up, exercise your voice and cool down your entire range anytime, anywhere, anyhow.\n\nGuitarists, bass players, pianists and all other types of musicians spend thousands of dollars on equipment. All these resources are put into improving their sound and feel, perfecting their art.\n\nAs singers, we have many options available, so why do we hesitate? What stops us spending money on our instrument?\n\n***** The answer is simple! *****\n\nThere are so many tools out there but none are made for YOUR voice. Most vocal programs are generalized for specific voice types and meant to be widely applicable. The problem here is that everybody’s voice is UNIQUE! We can’t just be slotted into a criterion and asked to perform. With such limitations, the extremes of your range cannot be explored and you cannot grow and improve as a singer.\n\nMore importantly, when substandard singing tools try to push you into the wrong vocal range you can end up damaging your voice! Unlike a guitarist, if we damage our instrument we can’t just go out and buy a new one.\n\n***** The benefits of a recording studio! *****\n\nWith Vocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos, you have all the benefits of a recording studio production at a fraction of the cost. When you voice improves and your range increases, you can simply update your warm ups with a few taps. No need for new recordings or additional costs!\n\nWhen we set out to make Vocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos we had a single mission: to produce a product that helps singers. And we mean really help. No gimmicks, no quick fix tools, just good old-fashioned exercises that can be customised for YOUR voice. These are the techniques and exercises that all singers use.\n\n***** Here are a few of the features this app makes available to you! *****\n\n- Complete control over your vocal range for each warm up.\n- Create an unlimited number of warm up playlists.\n- Select and reorder exercises to suit you needs.\n- Flawless playback controls with Tempo Memory. You only need to set the tempo of each exercise once and the app will remember your preference.\n- A step by step warm up creation wizard that will guide you through the steps you need to create your own playlists.\n- A huge variety of industry tested and proven vocal exercises, with even more to come in FREE updates.\n\nDon’t just take our word for it, see what the professionals have to say about Vocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos.\n\n***** Chris Kennedy - Voice Council *****\n\n\"Vocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos is well designed software that will, no doubt, appeal to many singers... when combined with a correct singing technique, the app is a useful and powerful tool for singers...\" \nhttp://voicecouncil.com/review-musicopoulos-vocal-warm-up-app\n\nWhen it comes to your unique voice, the secret of success is a Vocal Warm Up by Musicopoulos.\n\nWe have been able to produce an app that is astounding, and as singers ourselves we are proud and very happy to be able to share it with you."

SynthStation transforms your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad into a portable music production studio for mobile music creation. SynthStation gives you three powerful synthesizers for creating and modifying sonic textures used for melodies, chords, and bass lines. Built around Akai Professional’s history in synthesis and drawing on the newest MINIAK synth, SynthStation sounds great and offers wide-ranging sonic flexibility with its virtual analog synthesis.\n\nFrom the moment you start SynthStation, you'll know your way around. It is jam-packed with tools to help you create music with the convenience of your touch screen and each section works the way you work. With SynthStation, you can create and save sequences and complete songs. The app contains three different three-oscillator synths and a range of drum kits you can sequence and mix right in the SynthStation. For creating melodic and accompaniment parts, the SynthStation contains an arpeggiator with preset patterns, built-in effects and filters, and an XY touch control interface for expressive control of key parameters.\n\nPERFORM\nPlay with keys, XY and arpeggiator controls. This is perfect place to make magic happen because it gives you access to all the common controls you’ll need in a performance or creation setting.\n\nSYNTH\nComplete synthesis controls from oscillators to LFOs, envelopes, and more. You can control a wide range of filters to dial in exactly the sound you need. Choose from Sine, Triangle, Square or Sawtooth on your VCO and start creating your own signature sounds from scratch. Filter Cutoff and Resonance are just two taps away.\n\nDRUMS\nIn addition to SynthStation's three synthesizers, we've included drum kits and a visual representation of the most iconic beat making tool in the world - MPC pads. Just pick your kit and start tapping beats anywhere, anytime. Includes:\n\nDrum Kit – select the drum kit and play it with onscreen pads.\n\nDrum Edit – tune, mix, and customize your drums.\n\nSEQUENCER\nKeyboard grid – see your keyboard sequencing and edit notes easily.\n\nDrum grid – build and modify drum tracks with a visible sequencer grid.\n\nSONG/SEQUENCE\nSelect and save your Song/Sequence projects. You can recall your Songs and work on them later, and even export them for further editing in your desktop audio applications.\n\nCONTROL\nXY – two axes of control for hands-on, real-time control. Just like a joystick, the XY controller can snap back to the zero point.\n\nTempo – control tempo and even tap in the tempo you want.\n\nMIXER\nThe Mixer in SynthStation includes touch-controlled faders for each of the three synthesizers and the drum section as well as FX send for each. \n\nMixer – mix all the levels of the parts and effects. Just like a hardware mixer, there are faders, mutes, and effect routing.\n\nEffects – select and control FX type and parameters.\n\nSynthStation Studio enables you to create and produce music anywhere on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad."

RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools."

      "label": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis"

      "label": "SampleWiz was awarded Music Making App of the Year for 2011 by the Music Industries Association!\n\nCapture your sonic universe!\nListen… Record… Create…\n\nJordan says: In creating this instrument I wanted to create something that would appeal to the sonic explorer in all of us. Creating a sampler for iOS devices has allowed us to push the boundaries of traditional sampling instruments. From playing a selection of my signature sounds on the SampleWiz keyboard (JR lead anyone?) to getting up close and personal with sounds by playing directly on the waveform screen, our mission was to blow your mind, put a smile on your face, and expand your creativity. In creating SampleWiz, we have created partnerships with leading sound developers in addition to my personally selected onboard presets.\n\n\"Inspiring! Just when you thought nothing could be new in the world of sampling, along comes SampleWiz to fire up the neurons of our creativity in new ways. I love the the new realtime interactive noises I can get by 'touching the sound'...the crazy and unique stuff you can do with it is really expressive and fresh!\" - Eric Persing, Founder of Spectrasonics\n\n\"SampleWiz gets you playing instantly, and if you like to sample, there's no quicker or more fun way to go from recording to playing your own samples. Amazing controls, easy to understand yet deep enough to let you create musical voices! And it comes with a library of great sounds from Jordan Rudess. SampleWiz is a wiz if ever there was!\" - David Mash, VP of Technology and Education, Berklee College of Music \n \nWe have poured our hearts and minds into this and driven our families, bandmates, and friends insane by sampling everything that moves. I hope you enjoy this very expressive and wild music app creation!\n\n*Choose from three different sampling modes: classic, granular, and modern.\n*Classic - the traditional method of sampling where the sound will speed up and slow down as you go higher or lower than the recorded pitch.\n*Granular - Wizdom Music's own take on a granular synthesis engine. Adjust grain size and speed while the entire range of notes maintain the same speed.\n*Modern - explore new sampling possibilities using Dirac technology to allow formants and time to be adjusted automatically over a device-selected range.\n*Up to 10 seconds per sample.\n*Jordan Rudess presets from his private collection.\n*Resample anything that you play on the playing surface to create all new samples derived from your existing presets!\n*Three playing surface modes allow you to play on the keyboard, wave-edit screen, and the ADSR window. \n*Wizdom Music's Advanced Pitch Rounding for initial attack as well as after a slide.\n*Every note you play is an independent event allowing powerful, expressive control of pitch and amplitude. \n*Finger vibrato effect allows you to use vibrato even when pitch lock is activated!\n*Unique visuals for each sampling mode. A glow tracks your fingers and respond to the amount of amplitude of every note you play.\n*Choose from many different scales and customize your own. \n*Play your samples forward or reverse!\n*Looping options include standard looping as well as back-and-forth looping.\n*Allows trimming of samples.\n*Unique visualization of the amplitude envelope on the ADSR page.\n*FX include delay with a choice of tap-tempo, BPM, and seconds control over the rate. \n*Have two keyboards on the screen, each with its own range and scale! \n*Unique hold mode where every held note can be in a different synthesis mode! \n*Share your presets with friends by mailing them as SampleWiz files or standard audio files.\n*Play directly on the waveform and hear the audio that is right under your finger. Slide each finger separately in any direction to change pitch and position in the sample.\n*MAPI AudioCopy/AudioPaste allows sharing of audio with top audio apps.\n*Load your own audio files with iTunes file sharing.\n*Onboard help screens explain every parameter.

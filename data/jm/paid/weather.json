      "label": "************************************* \nFind all the photovoltaic data you need for your location. \n***********\nWhen you input coordinates manually, they have to be in decimal format. \nIf unsure, get coordinates from google maps. \n************\n\"This iPad and iPhone app is a comprehensive tool intended to help solar professionals calculate basically all aspects of a photovoltaic array. This includes weather information like clear sky days, hourly angle of the sun throughout the year and more.\n\nIt doesn’t stop there, though. The app generates information on the size of system you’ll need and how many panels would be in it. It also calculates what the size a battery backup would have to be for a proposed system. The app also includes a guide and a glossary where users can get more information.\n\nBasically, it’s like having a solar engineer at your fingertips.\" --cleanenergyauthority.com\n******\nThis is an application for professionals of the photovoltaic/solar panel industry. PV Master is essential to any person in the field who needs relevant information always available. \nWeather you’re a construction company/panel installer or serious DIY enthusiast this app will satisfy all your needs and requirements when it comes to setting up a green energy system. The sun is the future and with this app you can make it happen yourself. \n\nThe application is divided into 5 sections: \nData \nHere you have all the indeces you will ever need * explicitly for your current coordinates * (such as number of clear sky days, insolation incident, hourly solar angle relative to horizon, battery sizing and deficits, frequency of near-overcast skies, frost days average, average wind direction and speed, average monthly precipitation and pressure and much much more). \n\nGuide \nIf you’re a DIY look for home improvement or simply “getting started” in this field, here you will find a general guide with the necessary steps and considerations to be made when setting up a photovoltaic panel system. \n\nPannel Calc \nThe most frequently asked questions we face when looking into the feasability of sun as energy is “how many panels will I need?”. Thanks to this app the big question is easily answered. Gather the data from the first section and your current electricity bills, input the values and you’re done. Then it’s up to you to decide weather you wish to do it or not... \n\nBattery Calc \nIf you’re serious about going green then you definitely have to account for everything. The sun is always there but we all know there are many variables that might disrupt our “fuel”. For this reason we need to also account for batteries and surplus storage to evoid wasting potential energy and also not be “stuck” when during the colder season. Again, just gather data, insert it in the easy fields and you’re down. You know everything about kind, capacity and quantity of batteries you need. \n\nGlossary \nThis is another great section essential for any starter (although even experts will surely learn something form it). A collection of A-Z terms related to this this topic. You can jump to a certain letter if you wish to find something out otherwise just scrolling through it to educate yourself is a great way of spending time. \n\nAdditional Info \nOn startup, the app requests your location and fetches the specific data for the entire first section. This is on actual coordinates, not just state or city...pinpoint! \nEvery successful data fetch gets stored locally (no need to worry about privacy) so that if the next time you open the app there is no internet connection (perhaps you’re “on-site”) you will still have the everything available."

      "label": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget (pre iOS14), which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station.

Use Radar HD to see what weather is coming your way!  \n\nRadar shows areas of current precipitation or future simulated radar prediction!. A weather radar is used to locate precipitation, calculate its motion, estimate its type (rain, snow, hail, etc.), and forecast its future position and intensity.  Precipitation type is indicated by the color. Green color indicates lesser precipitation while the yellow color code indicates intense precipitations. The color code red is indicative of the most intense precipitations. Blue color indicates snow.\n\nUsing the data from Storm Prediction Center and Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (SPC & GDAC) Radar HD provides information about tropical storms and hurricanes for locations worldwide, areas affected by storms and severe weather, coordinates and wind speed, storm tracks & path projections.\n\nSatellite images provide an excellent view on the clouds in the sky and an indication of the weather over the United states, Europe, Japan, Australia and Indonesia.\nSatellite images come from satellites which remain above a fixed point on the Earth (i.e. they are “geostationary”). Lighter areas of cloud show where the cloud tops are cooler and therefore where weather features like fronts and shower clouds are.\n\nThe app also allows you to check the weather on your favorite places on maps. Interactive map includes live international weather conditions, local weather and time, ten-day forecasts and sunrise/sunset times for multiple places. You can add placemarks on the map to represent your favorite places or the places you’d like to visit. At a glance you can see the time and weather for all of your favorites.\n\n\n\nKey features:\n\n* [NEW] Predictive weather radar \n* [NEW] Simulated radar prediction for the next 60 minutes using five-minute intervals\n* The real time radar images provided by NEXRAD an accurate view of the weather situation in the U.S.\n* Storm / hurricane / typhoon tracker and projected paths (International and Global)\n* All severe weather alerts on interactive map, 126 weather alert types (U.S.)\n* High resolution weather radar.

With Sol, you can check times and get reminders of solar events, at home or while traveling! Great for everyone looking to plan activities based on sunlight. Use it to remind you to walk the dog before dark, get up with the sun, or find golden hour time for that perfect photo.\n\nSol: Sun Clock is the Swiss-army knife of sunlight tools with a design inspired by the simplicity of the sundial. Use it to plan your day, guide natural sleep cycles, get the best light for outdoor photography, make sure animals or kids are safe inside before dark, or to map out the best times to go running or fishing. \n\n* Be in tune: Sol will tell you when the golden hour is, how much sunlight you have left in the day or what time the next sunrise occurs.\n\n* Look to the future, travel around the world: Sol lets you find sunlight information for any date, anywhere on earth. \n \n* Find solar midnight and solar noon, and all three twilight (dawn and dusk) periods: astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight. Keep tabs on the next solstice and equinox.\n \n* Reminders and Alarms: Use Sol as a natural alarm clock that you can set to any event (like sunset, golden hour or solar noon), and the alarm or reminder time will adjust gradually as the days change with the seasons.\n \n* Automatic Location: Sol not only calculates the amount of daylight and sunrise and sunset times, but does so for any location in the world (both Northern and Southern hemispheres) by using your device's GPS... no network connection required. \n\n* Other locations: Optionally, use the built-in map to choose any location in the world by moving the pin, or search using the name of any city.\n \n* Optional location-aware alarms. Sol knows when you change with your location; and as you travel it will adjust any alarms you set relative to sunrise and sunset times.  Create alarms for multiple locations around the world.\n\n* Detailed almanac information: Useful information about the day's length, sun's azimuth and elevation, equinoxes and solstices, and a friendly glossary that explains all the terms. \n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. However, GPS runs in the background ONLY if you have set location-aware alarms."

AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning.\n\nEven if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple. If you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher.\n\nAwards\n-----------------\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124/\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916/\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/\n\nBest of 2021\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1591083005/\n\nBest of 2022\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1654240446"

Thank you very much. (^_^) - Version 3.4\nI started with this app two months ago as I prepared to renew my driver's license this August. I used it three times a day, and imagine my surprise at the result: I got a call back from the exam rep, saying \"You won't need to use your glasses anymore when driving. We're removing any glasses restrictions from your license.\" I was astonished! Thank you.\n\n■ Definitely improves vision. - Version 3.4\nI used the app continuously for three months, every day. I feel like my vision has improved considerably.\n\n■ Works - Version 3.4\nMy aging eyes have improved a bit. I plan to continue the regimen.\n\n■ The best! (^_^) - Version 3.4\nMy sight really improved!! \n\n============================================\n\nVision is made up of two components, that of the eyes themselves and that of the brain.\n\"Eye vision\", what we commonly think of as vision itself, is the ability of the eyes to focus in on the things that they see.\n\"Brain vision\" is the ability of the brain to take what the eyes have received and perceive that as an image.\nIn order to restore vision, it is not necessary to only train the physical eyes but the brain as well. \n\nIn 3D Eyesight Recovery, by looking at the 3D stereograms, \n・ Train your brain vision by trying to focus and see the 3D images.\n・ Strengthen eye muscles that are not commonly used.\n・ Stretch your eyes by using the opposing horizontal and cross viewing methods.\n・ Continue using it daily because of the enjoyment that viewing stereograms brings.\n\nThrough the use of this application you'll be able to accomplish the above four at once while performing enjoyable exercise for your eyes.\n\n￭ Instructions for Use\nLook at the stereogram using the walleyed method and the cross-eyed method, one after the other. Use this app regularly on a daily basis.\n\n※Looking at 3D stereograms is exercise, so your eyes will get tired. Please refrain from using this app for extended periods of time so as not to tire your eyes.\n\n※There is no guarantee that the effect will work on everyone."

Other studies have indicated that an audio tone at this same frequency might also be effective. The app is intended for those who are suffering, as well as proactive individuals who feel at risk.\n\nAs a proactive measure for everyone, and as potential help for those already suffering, daily GammaBoost® usage offers new hope."

Version 3.5  Sept. 15, 2012\nMy level of concentration has increased!  I have better memory too!  Now I can sleep well at night!\n\n■ Great!! \nIn studying or at work, I always use this app.  I am hooked on it!\n\n■ I can't live without this app! \nNo need to count sheep with this app!  I'm out like a light.\n\n■ My insomnia is gone!!! \nI guess everyone has different results but this app has sure worked to cure my insomnia!\n\n■ Someone with insomnia\nI had a slight case of insomnia but now all that is gone after listening to this app.\n\n■Explanation of this App\n1. When a person hears two different frequencies in their ears, the difference of those frequencies will appear in the brain as one frequency.  In this app that principle is used and your brain will be in a state as when you are sleeping.\n2. The sound of \"Flicker Noise\" is known to help balance the autonomic nervous system as it enters the hypothalamus of the brain, which helps relieve pressure on the sympathetic nervous system.\nThrough a combination of the two above methods you will be lead directly and indirectly into a deep sleep.\n※ The sound of \"Flicker Noise\" is the sound parameters of the background environmental sound.\n\nHow to Use\n1. Start the app.\n2. Choose your favorite background music.\n\nAlso, for more effective sounds through the change in settings.\nResults (sleep / relaxation/ concentration, memory)\n\n- The effects of concentrating\nThe mode is for increasing brain activity and raising your level of concentration before doing sports.\n- The effects of memory\nThis mode will take you a deeper level than the relaxation mode.  This mode is recommended for studying or raising your level of memory.\n\n※ The sound which can help each person is slightly different so we suggest that you try different settings to find the sound that best works for you.\n※There is no guarantee that the effect will work on everyone.\n\n\n○This application uses a binaural beat technology, which has been scientifically proven effective.\nHowever this method uses only 3db, so based on how sensitive the user is, there may be a gap in benefits received.\nEven if you did not get results your first time, keep using it every day. You should slowly see better results.\n\n○How to use this application effectively\n・Close your eyes, relax and assume a position laying down.\n・This application needs to use many low and high frequencies so use high quality headphones not cheap 100 yen ones.\n・If your ears start to hurt, please turn down the volume until until the music is barely audible.\n\n○ Our company has an app \"3D Eyesight Recovery\" to help restore eyesight using stereogram.\nStereogram uses the eyesocket muscles resulting in effectively stretching your eyes and it is said that when used before sleeping this app helps you to sleep more soundly.  Why not try this wonderful app?\n※ You need a special way to see Stereogram, so a little practice is required.  The instructions for this are in the app.\n\n※Binaural Beat is a technology which controls the brain waves.\nFor anyone with one of the following problems below, please consult your Physician.\n・ For Those with Epilepsy\n・ For Those with Heart Problems (especially those with pacemakers)\nDo not us this app when driving or doing other dangerous work."

      "label": "This application is a sidekick to the beastmaker 1000 and 2000. It has been designed to assist the user into gradually getting stronger on a fingerboard. The app does this by way of prewritten workouts which are often general and aim to improve all trainable grips on the board. Some are specific (2000 series only at the moment) which aim to improve, sloper strength, pocket strength and crimp strength. \n\nThere is also a new custom workout program fully adjustable and includes the 1000,2000 and micros, so if you have your own hang regime and different timings then that is all programmable and can be saved.\n\nBoth the workouts and custom timer now record hang contraction time (time spent actually hanging off the board) We recommend most users get up to around 20:00 minutes on this clock whilst doing their workouts.\n\nOn the Workout screen after you've selected your work out it is now possible to adjust set and hang times. Users who are only finger boarding and are having a rest day prior to and after training may wish to do up to 3 sets and 7 hangs. Other users may prefer to go for 2 sets and 6 hangs, this is what we'd consider an average and more suited to people doing additional types of training.\n\nPlease note the grades for the workouts aren't actually meant to relate to anything other than themselves. E.G. 5c is easier than 6a but harder than 5b. If you find 5a hard on the 1000, use a weight removal technique such as putting one foot on a chair in front of the board or using a pulley with weights on. More advice on this and other things are available in the general advice section on the Workout Ratings page.\n\nTo record your hangs press the record button (red circle icon) whilst resting. The Workout Ratings function is much improved and should now be a really useful training aid which records gradual progress and improvement.\n\nFingerboard gains take time, remember to warm up thoroughly and move on to more difficult hangs at a slightly slower pace than you think you should to give pulleys time to catch up with muscles. For example 10% strength gains over a year is brilliant improvement. 5% is still effective training.\n\nBest of luck with the training, happy hanging and we hope this helps with the motivation."

This App supports all complications, so make your Apple watch a real Fitness Gadget!!\n\nHow to Use:\n-\tATTENTION: Oxygen Saturation only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 6, because this Apple Watch has the sensor you need to measure your oxygen saturation.\n-\tThe app needs to connect with the Apple’s Health app to display the recorded data on your Apple Watch, as complication or your Iphone.\n-\tUsing iOS 14 you can add a Widget to your home screen on your IPhone to display the latest measurement.\n- In case you are still not receiving any data, please open your Apple Health App and check if it is able to measure your oxygen saturation."

      "label": "Mood Mint combines a variety of psychological techniques to help boost your mood, and reduce stress, anxiety and depression.\n\nThere are 4 main components to Mood Mint (all backed by hard science):\n\n1) COGNITIVE BIAS MODIFICATION\nAttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is a computer-based therapy that gets the user to repeatedly select positive information over negative information. The aim of the game is to tap the positive image as quickly as possible. In this way, CBM helps train your brain to automatically focus more on positive information in your everyday life.The result: less stress and a happier you. \n\nStudies show that Bias Modification can effectively lower anxiety with as little as 2 hours of treatment. A number of studies have shown that CBM can also help to alleviate depression. After several weeks of CBM, participants showed increased activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex – the area of the brain associated with more positive, happier thinking.\n\nMood Mint allows you to fully customize the Cognitive Bias Modification game – edit, delete, or add your own images for a personalized CBM experience. Add pictures of things you are grateful for, happy events and people that are special to you and give them a positive charge. These will also help to trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals during each training session.\n\n\nIf you would like to find out more about Atttentional Cognitive Bias Modification (ACBM), and how it is being used to treat anxiety and depression,  please visit BiasModification.com\n\n\n2) HAPPY NOTES\nSlides will appear during the cognitive bias modification session. These are loaded with bite-sized mental health tips, facts, stats, techniques and exercises to help boost your mood.  You can take your time reading the slides and carrying out the exercises as the timer will stop while they are on screen. \n\nAll of the 'Happy Notes' are based on leading research and theory in psychology and neuroscience fields. Each and every one of them can help to lower stress and anxiety, and improve overall mental health and wellbeing. \n\nGo to Settings to edit and add your own happy notes to the program.\n\n3) POSITIVE WORD SEARCH\nJust as focusing your attention on negative or threatening information can trigger the release of stress chemicals like cortisol and adrenaline, so focusing on positive information can trigger the release of ‘feel-good’ chemicals like serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins.\n\nResearch in the fields of psychology and neuroscience  have shown that our brains automatically releases feel-good neurochemicals whenever we focus on a positive word.\n\nThe word search is designed to trigger these ‘feel-good’ chemicals by getting you to focus on positive words. You need to find all 4 of the words listed below the letter grid to complete the word search. Drag your finger over the letters in the grid to highlight each of the words listed.\n\nTo maximise the positive psychological effect, try to think of all the positive things you associate with each word as you search for it.\n\n4) BREATHING EXERCISE\nThere is a guided breathing exercise at the end of each training session. Focusing on your breathing helps to ground you in the present, and triggers the parasympathetic (‘rest and digest’) response, helping you to instantly  feel  a little calmer. Focused breathing is an important element of mindful meditation, and it comes with a long list of mental health benefits.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that focused breathing meditation alone can help to lower stress, reduce anxiety and depression.\n\nHOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN?\nThe short answer – as often as you need to. For optimal results, you should aim to train for around 5 to 10 minutes per day,  and anytime in between if you're feeling stressed, anxious or upset.\n\nTo complete the program, you need to earn 10 000 points."

You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

      "label": "\"Hearing Analyzer Portrait\" is  an ear health check tool that allows you to measure very wide audible frequency ranges to your hearing.\n\nThe human ear possesses an auditory range from 20Hz to 20kHz. In addition to conventional audiometry (125Hz - 8kHz), the extended low-frequency audiometry and high-frequency audiometry including Mosquito sounds are available. You can self-diagnose the sound listening ability. \n\nBy measuring the characteristics of your current hearing, please try to consider the wellness of your ears and the way of natural sound reproduction. It is possible to measure the hearing of the audio range by finding the minimum point in the operation of the slider volume that you can hear the tesing pure tone for each frequency. The results are displayed in easy-to-read charts like the audiogram.\n\nRecommended to check your own hearing ability on a daily basis for the audiophile, music players, sound professionals and all music lovers. Try to check if you have the golden ears!\n\nFeatures:\n- Broadband hearing test in 3 frequency bands:  LF (Low Frequency) - 30Hz to 100Hz, BAS. (Basic frequency) - 125Hz to 12kHz, MOS. (Mosquito, Extended High Frequency) - 13kHz to 20kHz.\n- Test tones of LF: 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 (Hz)\n- Test tones of BAS.: 125, 250, 500, 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 12k (Hz)\n- Test tones of MOS.: 13k, 14k, 15k,16k, 17k, 18k, 19k, 20k (Hz)\n- Test channel: Left, Right\n- Test tone type: Intermittent signal (Tone A) / Continuous signal (Tone B)\n- Measurement result graph display (LVL/ATH/BOTH): Frequency response of hearing - Linear level without ATH compensation (LVL),  ATH (*1) compensation (ATH), Both results (BOTH)\n- Clear setting and results. (Reset)\n- Snapshot of single band result. (Snap)\n- Snapshot of full band result. (Snap-W) \n\n*1: ATH (Absolute Threshold of Hearing)\nATH is also known as the hearing threshold, and is the minimum sound pressure level of pure tone that can be detected on the hearing in noise-free environment. Human is said to be able to listen from 20Hz to 20kHz, but the sensitivity of the hearing will vary greatly depending on frequency. ATH varies with age and sex, but is a good sensitivity at mid range (1kHz - 5kHz), and needs more greater sound pressure level at a lower and higher frequency. The information in ATH graph is just for reference purposes.\n\nAttentions:\nPlease use the headphones that provided with iPhone in the hearing test.\nThis application generates a test tone signal with a high gain, so please special attention to the volume adjustment.\nBefore the diagnosis start, please set the hardware volume control to the central position of 50%. If you move the volume slider upward, the output volume will have a large gain. So as not to be excessively large gain for your ears, please adjust it carefully. \n\nRemarks:\nIn general, a high risk of hearing loss has been known if you continue to hear the sounds of a high acoustic pressure level, such as, listening of the portable audio and working with too loud noises.\nAccording to WHO, some 1.1 billion teenagers and young adults are at risk of hearing loss due to the unsafe use of personal audio devices, including smartphones, and exposure to damaging levels of sound at noisy entertainment venues such as nightclubs, bars and sporting events.\nWe hope that you keep to have an interest on a daily basis to the wellness of hearing by  this app. If you feel the need to health management of ear, it is recommended to visit the medical specialist.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis app is not intended to be used for a medical purpose. This app is not intended to diagnose, prevent, monitor, treat, alleviate or compensate a disease, an injury, a disability or a handicap.

A healthy person constantly adapts the heart rhythm to the current requirements. The number of heart beats per minute is therefore constantly changing, which is a good sign of the organism's ability to adapt.\r\n\r\nResearchers at the University of Zaragoza in Spain have shown that the values recorded by the Apple Watch during a session with the Breath app are very accurate. Comparable with professional chest straps.\r\n\r\nTo filter your own HRV data, this app offers the possibility to display only those HRV values that are recorded during such a session.\r\n\r\nThe Apple Watch is measuring your HRV Data and writes it to Healthkit.\r\nThis app connects with Apple’s Health app to displays the recorded data on a Watch App, a complication and your Iphone. \r\n\r\nHow to Use:\r\n-\tATTENTION: This app only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 3 or later.\r\n-\tIf you want to measure a new value, use the Breath App from Apple.\r\n-\tTo get to most out of your data it is important that you measurement does always take place in the very same situation.

The person with scoliosis stands in front of the person holding the mobile device with the Scoliometer app. \n2. The person with scoliosis slowly reaches their hands towards the floor, bending forward through the back.\n3. The person with Scoliometer app pulled up on their mobile device puts their thumbs under either side of the phone while looking at the app. They rest their thumbs on either side of the spine and slide the phone down the person’s back in front of them while they roll down.\n• Accurate: doctors can use it along with home users\n• Informative: users can save their previous results on their own to show changes over time by saving a screen shot of the Scoliometer at the highest degree of curvature\n\nTips:\n\nNot sure if you have scoliosis? Get the app to find out if your spine has rotation. If your readings show that rotation is present, make an appointment with your doctor to confirm if scoliosis is present. Then, use the Scoliometer regularly to track your rotation."

      "label": "This app is for parents who want to spend quality, quiet time with their children. It's a fun way to practice being quiet with your child just by setting the clock-timer.\n\nWith this app, voice levels are measured simultaneously by the microphone function of the iPhone/iPad. If the volume of your child's voice exceeds the limit that you pre-set, it will wake up a scary dog and the dog starts barking. But don't worry, soon after the dog, a cute little girl will show up on its screen and cheer your kids up.\n\n【 Supported devices: microphone required, iOS 6 or later 】\niPhone 4S or later, iPad 2 or later, iPod Touch 4th generation or later\n* Both iPhone and iPad support (Universal)\n\n【 Usage example 】\nWhen your kids are making loud noise at home and/or in public places, scolding them can sometimes cause more problems that it solves. With this app, keeping the sleeping dog from waking up can make quiet time fun for your kids! You can then, instead of scolding, praise the kids for doing well. \n\n【 Features 】\n• You can pre-set the timer from seconds to minutes, or time-free mode.\n• You can change its voice limit depending on the environment, e.g., outside or in the house.\n• You can check the history of your challenge in graph form after the end of each session.\n• The following options are also available.\n- Immediate Termination: A session will terminate immediately after the volume of the child's voice exceeds the limit.\n- Auto Retry: The next session will automatically restart from the beginning after the immediate termination, and kids can try it until they make it.\n- Sounds on/off.\n- Voice Narration on/off\n\n【 For children with developmental disorders 】\nChildren with developmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder or ADHD can often make repetitive vocal sounds known as Vocal Stimming or repetitive clapping. That can be disruptive in their day lives and may hinder their learning. With this app, children in the spectrum can practice controlling their voices/clapping effectively. This app can also be used as their time-aid because it's easy to check the remaining time of the session visually through the clock-timer.\n\n【 Precautions for use 】\n• Recommended for ages 4-12\n• Younger children should use it together with their parents.\n• In order to prevent children terminating a session by mistake, the stop button (back button) hides off screen. It will reappear when you tap the upper part of your iPhone/iPad screen.\n• By adjusting the voice level, the app can be used in slightly noisier environments. However, it is difficult to use in very loud places.\n• Since this app is a training support tool, children will not necessarily become quiet immediately. Moreover, this may not work for all children.\n• Since power-saving mode is turned off during a session, it is recommended that your iPhone/iPad be connected to a charger for long time usage.\n\n【 PRIVACY POLICY 】\nThis app:\n- Does not contain ads\n- Does not contain in-app purchases\n- Does not contain social media integration\n- Does contain links to Keaton.com's apps and official web site\n- Does not use analytics or data collection tools\n\nThis app contains Parental Gate that restricts your kids from accessing a parents section (includes Keaton.com's More Apps and official web site)."

Unlike binaural beats.\n\nMindwave 2 tones have been meticulously designed to produce the greatest neural response during EEG tests.\n\nBinaural beats are great and they work for most people but we found that other methods tend to be more effective and more flexible, such as Isochronic tones.\n\nTechnical Description of isochronic beats:\nIsochronic tones are regular beats of a single tone used for brainwave entrainment. The interference pattern that produces the beat is outside the brain so headphones are not required (use with a dock), but since isochronic tones are more pronounced, the stimuli is even stronger with the use of headphones/ear buds."

You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

We are issuing a fix for this.  In the meantime, please search for the app via the search function in iTunes.\n---\n\nWe live in a stressful world, where getting a good night's sleep can be a difficult thing.  Lack of quality sleep can lead to even more stress and disorders, and it all becomes a vicious circle.  \n\nTo combat this problem, the Hibino Sound Therapy Lab (led by renowned composer Norihiko Hibino) and Mission One have worked together to develop the \"Prescription for Sleep\" application for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nFEATURES\n\n・Peaceful Sleep Via Music and Imagery\nThere are four stages of sleep, and the goal of Prescription for Sleep is to guide you to the relaxed state necessary to enter the first stage.  This is done through soothing imagery and therapeutic music, recorded live on acoustic instruments at a rhythm that recreates the pulse of a mother's heartbeat as heard from the womb.  \n\n・High-Quality Sound with Therapeutic Frequencies\nThe music in Prescription for Sleep contains some inaudible frequencies in the 50-60 kHz range, which replicate frequencies found in nature, such as those of a murmuring forest stream.  These 24-bit, 96 kHz recordings were created using special mastering techniques, and have a bandwidth that most standard sound sources cannot duplicate.\n\n・Simple, Peaceful Melodies\nBeautiful, simple melodies give you something to appreciate while the healing effects of the music and visuals are taking place.\n\n・A Dreamlike Story\nThis work features four complete songs that take you on a journey -- from a storybook, to the stars, to heaven, and to the source of life.  The soft colors and slow movements will provide tranquility as you embark on this journey."

      "label": "Mission One and the Hibino Sound Therapy Lab are proud to present an all-new version of the hit sleep-aid app, Prescription for Sleep.\r\n\r\nIn this modern world, we are constantly bombarded with an unprecedented amount of information.  Print media, television, and the Internet all provide heavy doses of stimulation, and it’s easy for people to get caught up in the storm. However, in order to achieve a state of mind/body relaxation necessary for a good night’s sleep, you need a way to leave all that stimulation behind.  We believe the sights and sounds in this application can help you do that.\r\n\r\nIn experiments using EEG, we have found that sound created by specific musical instruments, such as tenor sax, harp, and piano, cause the brain to create theta waves, which are brain waves associated with mediation and the early stages of sleep.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this research, renowned composer Norihiko Hibino created the four songs in this app especially for the purpose of helping listeners achieve a relaxed state.  Special microphones were used to pick up the subtleties of the instruments, and the recordings were mixed and mastered in 24-bit 96KHz, in a way that is optimized for iOS devices.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely hope Prescription for Sleep 2 can help you achieve a pleasant night’s sleep."

Your own editing using the Hints function  \n In Notation input mode, you can edit the the created melody yourself.\nIf you enable the Hints function when you're editing the tune, the notation is color coded as a reference for your edits (notes that match the chord, notes in the same scale, notes that increase the tension and other notes you need to be aware of).\n\n4. Using simple steps, you can upload your finished tune as a video to YouTube along with the staff notation, or slideshow of photos. You can also send your tunes as email attachments in AAC or MIDI format, and it's really easy to make your own ringtones*1 too.\n*1: To use your tune as an iPhone ringtone, you need to connect to a Mac or Windows computer and transfer the tune to your iPhone via iTunes."

      "label": "Create music with Loopy HD by layering looped recordings of singing, beatboxing, or playing an instrument with a savvy, sophisticated, tactile looper that totally reinvents the formula. As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com. I may be able to fix your issue in less time than it would take to write a negative review!"

      "label": "Deluxe generative edition of Brian Eno's acclaimed 2017 ambient album, Reflection.\n\n\"REFLECTION is the most recent of my Ambient experiments and represents the most sophisticated of them so far. My original intention with Ambient music was to make endless music, music that would be there as long as you wanted it to be. I wanted also that this music would unfold differently all the time - ‘like sitting by a river’: it’s always the same river, but it’s always changing. But recordings - whether vinyl, cassette or CD - are limited in length, and replay identically each time you listen to them. So in the past I was limited to making the systems which make the music, but then recording 30 minutes or an hour and releasing that. REFLECTION in its album form - on vinyl or CD - is like this. But the app by which REFLECTION is produced is not restricted: it creates an endless and endlessly changing version of the piece of music.” - Brian Eno\n\nMinimum requirements:\n\niPad 3\niPhone 5\niPad mini 2\nAppleTV (4th generation)"

      "label": "Simple mandolin tuner to tune up your mandolin. This is for a standard mandolin, in GDAE tuning.\n\nTuning your mandolin can be a difficult task for you if you are just beginning mandolin. The good news is, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. A nicely tuned mandolin can make your music sound a lot better and help you greatly while you're are just getting the hang of finger placement for notes.\n\nTouch the note for the string you want to tune and then turn the tuning pegs on your mandolin and match it up with the tone that is being played. The thing that is special about mandolins, is that the strings are in pairs of two. Each string in a pair is exactly the same note. The reason why mandolins are like this is because it creates a cool chorus-like effect.\n\nTip: Make several passes tuning each of the strings. For example you might have noticed that if you have tuned all the strings once, and then back to the first one you tuned, it might be off a little bit. This is because you are increasing or decreasing the tension on each of the strings as you tune it and the instrument's body might bend ever so slightly due to this difference in tension. This causes the other strings to slightly change in pitch. So make sure you keep on checking and tuning the strings until all are in tune, so make several passes.\n\nFor more information on how to tune Mandolin visit:\nhttp://www.tuneinstrument.com/how-to.html\n\nAny questions using the App?

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

Even practice that's slightly boring (such as practicing the production of single notes) will become enjoyable. The cortosia is  a completely new type of interactive tuner app designed to improve the overall quality of sound produced by the artist.\n\n* Analyzes five elements of “good sound” and rates them in real time\n* Automatically records “good sound” so you can check your daily improvement in technique\n* Lets you compete against the world in “good sound” and vie for ranking\n* Supports flute, clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, saxophone, trombone and euphonium\n\nAnalyze five elements of “good sound” and rate them in real time:\nJust what is “good sound”? Beautiful sound, pleasant sound, sound that resonates in the listener's heart. Perceptions of “good sound” differ between people, but could there be some commonalities? Through cooperative research with Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain, under the direction of Professor Xavier Serra, Korg has arrived at a technology “Artistry” (*1) for evaluating “good sound” based on five elements.\n\n1: Pitch Stability\n2: Dynamic Stability\n3: Timbre Stability\n4: Timbre Richness\n5: Attack Clarity\n\nSimultaneously with the tuner display, a radar chart shows the results of analyzing these five elements in real time, and scores them on a scale of 100 points. While tuning, you can see at a glance what aspects of your tone are lacking. You can also listen to a model tone and hear how it differs from your own sound. This is highly recommended for beginners who have just started a musical instrument, as well as for intermediate players who want to advance to the next level.\n\n*1: Automatic Rating Technology for musical InSTRument plaYers\n\nAutomatically record “good sound,” and check your daily advances in technique:\nData is automatically recorded and kept when tuning and scoring. You can audition the accumulated recording data or recall a radar chart for it, and you can also check the number of hours you practiced and your best score for each day. By looking at your past results, you can see how you are progressing. In addition, you can post your score to a social networking service such as Facebook or Twitter allowing you to record or upload your daily progress (or backsliding) as if you were writing a diary. Whether you use this to compete with your friends or to give encouraging comments, it's a great way to improve your skill while enjoyably sharing information.\n\nCompete with the world for “good sound”:\nYour ranking is compiled by averaging your highest score for each note, and displayed. You'll be able to see your current position among performers around the world who use cortosia.\n\nSupports flute, clarinet, trumpet, violin, cello, saxophone, trombone and euphonium.\n\nA full range of basic functionality including tuner, metronome, and level meter:\nIn addition to a chromatic tuner that benefits from Korg's forty years of know-how in tuner development, there's a metronome that supports tap tempo, and even a level meter, making cortosia a great partner for performance or practice."

This app is TOPS! Highly recommended! The developers are serious about what they do. You will not be disappointed!\n\n- Joel Avery\n\n——\n\nWhy We Created Quiztones EQ Ear Training Apps ...\n\nWe thought there should be an easier way to learn how to use EQ, train your ears and expedite the path to getting professional quality mixes, recordings and productions.\n\nWhen I was at music school ten years ago studying audio engineering and music production, my teacher turned an iMac around, pulled up an EQ in Pro Tools and started quizzing the class on which audio frequencies he was boosting or cutting in a mix. That's when it hit me — this should be an app, with various difficulty levels, a scoring system and the ability to import your own source material for quizzes that will teach you how to use EQ like a pro.\n\nFast forward to today — 50k app downloads later — and we're still just as excited to keep evolving Quiztones to help you take the quality of your mixes, recordings and productions to the next level."

But no musical note makes a piece of music without being played to right rhythms.  \n\n\"My Little Rhythm\" surely is an amusing musical game, and playing it with repetition lets the player to read rhythms faster, and eventually the entire score easier. Unlike printed material, visual and acoustic perception help players to feel rhythms more intuitively. \n\nLet alone the acoustic education for children, this makes a perfect rhythm training tool for everyone, from children to grown-ups, and for those playing in a brass band, chorus group, as well as a rock band.\n\nYou can find a movie in my support page.\nhttp://token.sakura.ne.jp/wp/?page_id=1930"

When the player can stroke at the same speed as the members of BEGIN, they've become a master!\nAdditionally in the, \"Ai no Te,\" corner, BEGIN's music includes both, \"Ai no Te,\" and, \"Yubi-Bue,\" indispensable parts of Okinawan music.

      "label": "Yamaha's Mobile Music Sequencer enables composers to combine a range of phrase patterns and create musical compositions intuitively, following the flow of composition, from phrases to sections and from sections to songs.\nWherever you are, you can now sketch the outline of a composition. In addition, you can use the ingredients to delicately craft songs on a Yamaha synthesizer, or in Steinberg Cubase.\n\nCreate a song right away as follows:\n\nStep 1-Create phrases\nYou can choose from a rich selection of 382 preset phrases (the phrase is the smallest unit in the structure of a composition). Under Phrase in the View screen, tap on a cell in which no setting has been made, then tap on the Select button on the left. To listen to a preset phrase, tap on its name. It is also possible to use real-time recordings made using the keyboard within an application, or user phrases which have been created using piano roll input. Using the powerful Loop Remix function, it is possible to divide selected phrases at specified intervals and then order them randomly, automatically insert rolls or breaks, and thus rework them into new phrases.\n\nStep 2-Create sections\nCombine multiple phrases together to create a section. Phrases are arranged in a vertical block and playback is turned on and off using the Section button at the bottom of the screen. The phrases can be managed as a single unit.\nBy specifying codes for individual sections, you can easily create variations. Using the Create command you can also create a succession of new sections based on the phrase that is currently being played back, which allows production to proceed smoothly.\n\nStep 3-Create Songs\nPut together complete songs by pasting together sections. This is easily accomplished by touching the Section area and then just dragging and dropping sections into the data area. Naturally, you can also input sections by recording in real time or by using the piano roll screen.\n\nAdvantages\n• Built-in software synth with 92 high-quality sounds (including 9 types of drumkit) enables faithful rendering of sequence patterns.\n• Sound editing using filters, EG, and other effects\n• Mixer function for each part\n• Effects including reverb, chorus, and variations\n• Audio Chord Assist functions\nAudio Chord Assist automatically analyzes chord progressions and displays the results. You can copy this chord information from songs stored in music apps and paste it into any section of your own song. \n• Additional phrases and sounds\nFour additional voice and phrase datapacks can be purchased directly using the application. (Dance Pop, Electronic, Hip Hop, R&B). Moreover, two additional song and phrase datapacks and one phrase datapack can be also purchased directly using the application.(Song and Phrase datapack: TeddyLoid/Mobile Conductor, access/Eien Dive, Phrase databack: QY Pack)\n*In case your purchased pack can't be transferred to the app, please tap the \"Restore Purchases\" button at the bottom of the purchase screen.\n• File export\nAs well as a function for outputting standard general-purpose MIDI files, the application also includes a function for exporting files in an even easier-to-use format designed for Yamaha synths, in which characteristic sounds are specified in advance. (MOTIF XF, S90XS/S70XS, MOXF6/MOXF8, MOX6/MOX8, MX49/61, Tyros5 and MOTIF XS)\nWe also support Dropbox as an export destination folder.\n• Mix-down\nAudio mix-down of a song or a phrase and conversion of the song or the phrase to an audio file can be performed in real time.\n• Compatibility with SoundCloud"

      "label": "Similar to the human cochlea where the different frequencies are split-up and analyzed, The Snail for iOS uses a spiral grid to visualize root notes and overtones of any incoming sound with utmost precision. The Snail is based on recently developed technology making instrument tuning easy and audio analysis music-oriented and fun to watch.\n\nTune any instrument with utmost precision\n\nVersion 2 offers an additional guitar tuning mode that is available in the tuning view. Just tap on a dedicated string name, play a note and adjust the guitar tuning accordingly. Another major improvement is the new split window mode. Whenever you do any adjustments to parameters you now see how the edits affect the visualization in the upper section. This works in both visualization modes. One mode is the snail grid, a complete musical overview of the audio spectrum. The other one, the tuner view, is especially designed to focus on the root note for tuning purposes. In both views there is a sine tuning oscillator available which is controlled simply by touching the desired note on the iPhone display. There are a lot of customizable parameters. No problem if you would like to tune transposing instruments or if you need a tuning reference other than 440 Hz.\n\nPatented technology\n\nThe well-known IRCAM institute for acoustic and music research in Paris is responsible for the new technology of detection and visualization. It is a patented invention by Thomas Hélie, CNRS researcher at the Sciences and Technologies for Music and Sound (STMS) Laboratory (IRCAM/CNRS/Sorbonne Université). The Snail is also available for macOS and Windows, as stand-alone app or plug-in (VST3/AU/AAX), distributed by Plugivery.\n\nKey features\n\n•\tPrecise audio analysis and instrument tuning in two modes.\n•\tSnail view for a sophisticated visual representation of root note and overtone structures.\n•\tTuner view to tune instruments and to control pitches of voices and other sources.\n•\tFast access guitar tuning (GT) mode.\n•\tSplit window settings menu.\n•\tVisual gain and mic gain controllers.\n•\tSwitchable auto detection.\n•\tTouch sine tuning oscillator.\n•\t2 color modes: coherency index and magnitude.\n•\tAdjustable grid range (octaves).\n•\tSetup for transposing instruments.\n•\tMany customizable parameters like tuning reference, frequency tracking and audio window size."

When played as a solo instrument, the tabla is accompanied (usually on the harmonium or sarangi) by a continuous cyclical musical phrase or riff called the \"Lehra\" or \"Nagma\" (ostinato in western music) that keeps track of the \"aavartan\" or rythmic cycle in the chosen \"taal\".\n________________________________________\n\n◆ AND NOW PRESENTING - iLehra ◆\niLehra was the first electronic Lehra / Nagma player for the iPhone and iPod Touch, and its now available on the iPad as well! It provides accurate as well as pleasing lehra accompaniment for a wide variety of taals and raags on the Harmonium, Santoor, Violin, or the Flute. Innovative features include tanpura auto-tuned to the chosen lehra/raag, presets, tap-tempo, metronome, and extremely intuitive controls.\n\nSee the iLehra website for a YouTube demo:\n   http://iLehra.com\n________________________________________\n\n◆ KEY FEATURES ◆\n√ Plays 109 Lehras in 55+ raags for 25 taals\n√ Taals included:  Ada Chautaal(14), Basant Taal(9), Chartal-ki-Sawari(11), Chautaal(12), Dadra(6), Deepchandi(14), Dhamar(14), Ektaal(12), Faradost/Firdost(14), Ganesh Taal(21), Jhaptaal(10), Jhoomra(14), Keherva(8), Matta Taal(9), Pancham Sawari(15), Rudra Taal(11), Rupak(7), Sooltaal(10), Teentaal(16), as well as general lehras for 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 13, and 18 beats.\n√ Beautiful, realistic lehras on Harmonium, Violin, Flute, or Santoor!\n√ Full octave of pitch adjustments from C through B\n√ INTEGRATED AUTO-TUNER: Auto-Tune iLehra to your tabla, or use it to tune other instruments (microphone capability required such as iPhone built-in mic or 2nd/3rd generation iPod Touch with external microphone)\n√ BACKGROUND PLAY: Start playing the lehra and switch to another app, or play along with iPod music\n√ TAP TEMPO: just tap the beats on the bottom display and watch iLehra sync up!\n√ PRESETS: save your frequently-used combinations of pitch, taal, lehra, instrument & tempo as named presets.

Everything from the pad layouts, scales, new graphics to the sounds work together really well. Also, the new sounds are really, really good (great strings and choir samples). IMHO that this app just quadrupled in value with this free update.\" - Music-311\n\n\"Thanks for such an awesome app, I love that it lets you intuitively visualize and experiment with a \"Tonnetz\" layout, and better understand Neo-Riemannian theory - as such, Navichord is the perfect gateway from abstract, heady harmony concepts to immediate and practical music being played- a priceless possibility! And it looks beautiful and the tones are great, to boot\" - RepentHarlequin73\n\n\"This is really a nice, simple, clean app. I love the way you laid out the UI and I especially like that single notes can be tapped first and then dragged seamlessly between notes to produce the chord, then back to another single note if desired. For what it's worth, here are five stars... ***** This app will replace several other more expensive \"chord progression lab\" apps that I own because I think it's UI design is excellent and perfect for my needs.\" - ZenLizard\n\n\"Find using the harmonic grid more intuitive than a piano keyboard, being able to press in the middle of three circles to get major and minor chords is genius. Experimenting with chord patterns and having the chord name at the top and the root and other keys displayed on the keyboard, is helping me get my head around more complex chords.\" - mister-rz\n\n\"Downloaded the app when I read about it on dischord. I'm really happy...looks like a great app to explore chord variations.\" - Jonathan Paran Aran\n\n\"Read about it on Synthtopia. Bought it just now, love it already. Thanks Denis!\" - Dominik Assig\n\n\"Excelente app para aprender acordes y armonia.\" - R3dhood\n\n\"It can definitely be a source of inspiration.\" - Luca\n\n\"...it helps (when it comes to chord progressions).

      "label": "Room Reverberation (RT60), SPL (dB) Meter, Spectrum Analyzer, Signal Generator, Polarity Checker.\n \nFeatures 1/1, 1/3 & 1/6 octave RTA modes, Leq, RT60 (wideband, and Octave), spectrogram, peak frequency, Fast, Medium & Slow filters, Flat & A/C Weighting, Averaging, SPL Chart Recorder, Noise Criteria (NC), White/Pink Noise, Sine, Square, Triangle, Sweep, Ramp and Impulse signals & loudspeaker polarity checker. Frequency spectrum store & load, RT60 store,  and Chart store. Stored files can be sent as Email.\n\nIncludes ISO Octave Calibration feature - corrects for your device's microphone response. Also includes wideband calibration. The calibration discs are moved up or down so as to obtain a flat response, and match the overall SPL to that of an external meter.\n\nUse: home theater, audio engineer, car audio, etc\n\nOnline manual at: https://sites.google.com/site/bofinit/iaudiotool\n\nPlease join the AudioTool Discussion Group to request features or report problems:\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/audiotool-discussion-group\n\nAudioTools's Spectrum Analyzer component uses FFT on batches of samples recorded at the microphone. Hann windowing reduces aliasing. Recorded spectra may be stored as files in the device memory, and then loaded later and displayed together with the live spectrum. \n\nThe \"Store\" button will store the current live spectrum. The \"Load\" button brings up a list of stored spectra. One of these can be chosen, or the \"Cancel\" item selected to return to the main display, or the \"Clear\" item selected to remove the currently loaded spectrum.\n\nData collection can be paused and restarted.\n\nThe deciBel meter component uses IIR filters and exponential averaging to calculate Flat, A and C weighted response at speeds of Fast, Medium and Slow.\n\nA pair of cursors can be shown on the RTA and Chart Recorder displays: each can be moved to any position, and will display the SPL & time/frequency values measured there. Initially, both cursors are positioned mid-screen - simply drag them to a new position with the fingertip. The cursors can be turned on and off in the Menu.\n\nThe loudspeaker polarity checker can be used to check whether a loudspeaker is wired in phase: connect the AudioTool output to the speaker under test, select \"Polarity\" from the signal generator screen, then return to the RTA screen. If the speaker is out of phase (polarity reversed) AudioTool will show \"Pol ---\", otherwise \"Pol +++\" if the speaker is in phase.\n\nThe Noise Criteria (available from the Menu) function shows  a set of NC contours overlaid on the 1/1 Octave RTA display and the calculated real time current NC value is also shown.\n\nThe Chart Recorder shows a moving trace of the SPL measurements over the last few minutes.\n\nReverberation (RT60) measurements can be made by starting the RT60 component and using a loud clap (or similar) to trigger the measurement. RT60 times measure how much reverberation or echo there is in a room or auditorium.\n\nThe Signal Generator generates White and Pink Noise, Sine, Square, Triangle and Ramp waves, and Impulses. The generator uses multiple cycled buffers that are refreshed randomly so ensuring truly random White/Pink noise. The Pink Noise algorithm uses Kemmet's method to adjust White Noise into Pink.\n\nSine/Square/Ramp/Triangle Frequency can be set via the arrow buttons or directly entered using the keyboard.\n\nThe Impulse signal is a delta, issued approximately once per second. \n\nThe accuracy in frequency of the generated periodic signals is quite good: on the iPad, errors were of the order of 1% throughout most of the range. Sine wave fidelity is good throughout most of the audio range. Other signals' leading and trailing edges show ringing and decreasing frequency response artefacts in the upper ranges.\n\nDisclaimer: iAudioTool's performance depends on the iPad/iPhone hardware, and is not guaranteed to meet any audio measurement or safety standards."

Rumours among the workers spread quickly that there was a strange feeling being around these boxes, as if time flows in a different way, not just forward but sometimes also folding back on itself. The miners nicknamed them, the five boxes of reverberation. After the excavation process, to study them more closely, it was decided to transport them back to earth. \n\nRymdigare is part reverb, part noise and drone machine, part quality degrader and part wave shaper. The reverb is built from 5 reverberation boxes where you can control the sound with length and ratio parameters, tail and weight skew parameters and an internal feedback parameter, that could be used to create swelling tails. There is also a built in octave shifter, resonant filter, speed and level degrader and 4 LFO sources for modulating a selected set of parameters, including the LFO speeds themselves. The app can run stand-alone, connecting to other apps through Inter App Audio or AudioBus or it can run as an AUv3 plugin. Map and control any parameter with MIDI using Core MIDI, Bluetooth MIDI, Inter App Audio MIDI or AUv3 MIDI.\n\n+ Resonant filter (low, band or high pass)\n+ Noise and drone machine\n+ Level and speed degrader\n+ Wave shaper (input and output gain)\n+ Reverb (length, ratio, skew, tail, feedback and type: free, bpm, tuned)\n+ Reverb random variation controls\n+ Octave shifter up and down\n+ Planet orbits (LFO: double tap on parameter controls to map)\n+ Inter App Audio, AudioBus and AUv3\n+ Map Midi CC using Core MIDI, Bluetooth MIDI, IAA Midi or AUv3 MIDI."

And, thanks to BLEASS’ super-intuitive interface design, that entire sonic palette is within easy reach of even the most non-technical of musicians.\n\nMegalit includes many innovations that will empower your sound designs:\n- Advanced wavetable oscillators can adjust both wavetable position and fold, bringing near-infinite variety to each of the synth’s 130+ wavetables;\n- Per-oscillator unison mode allows you to create complex layering that would normally require you to load additional synths into your project;\n- Noise generator with dedicated high- and low-pass filtering for super-flexible non-tonal sounds and sound components.\n- Resonant high-pass and low-pass filters that can be applied to individual oscillators or pairs of oscillators, as can the built-in waveshaper and bit-crusher processors;\n- Four LFOs, each with its own timing curve and output smoothing, that allow for the creation of exceptionally complex – not to mention original – modulation patterns;\n- Advanced Motion Sequencer for the creation of complex repeating modulation patterns;\n- Per-patch storage of performance controller response curves ensure a sound will always respond the way you expect it to;\n- Patch randomising feature always produces useable sounds;\n- Built-in multi-band upward/downward compressor provides exquisite control over a sound’s dynamics and punchiness.\n\nAll of Megalit’s parameters, settings and controls, no matter how advanced, are laid out at your fingertips, with intuitive visual feedback ensuring you always know exactly what the synth is doing. And, despite its huge sonic power, Megalit is super-efficient on your system, leaving you with plenty of headroom for running additional instruments and effects… or, better still, more instances of Megalit!\n\n\nBLEASS Megalit is available as an AUv3 plugin or standalone App.\nBLEASS Megalit is also available for Window & Mac Users.\nMore information available on https://www.bleass.com/megalit"

It provides all functions for creating electronic music from scratch.\n\n- Easy to use sequencer, suitable for rhythm and melody\n- Automatisation of all parameters\n- 8 channels, each can be synth or sampler\n- 8 patterns per channel\n- Sample via microphone\n- Re-sample\n- Polyphonic FM-, PWM- and noise synth\n- Song editor with loop function\n- Send and receive projects via e-mail\n- WAV export\n- Sharing projects and audio in file sharing apps like Dropbox is possible when these apps are installed.\n- MIDI sync with other devices\n\n\nThe Synth\n\nNanoloop's FM synth offers a maximum of flexibility within a small set of parameters. It comes with a stereo modulator detune effect and covers the typical clean bells and Rhodes-like sounds, spheric pads, thick beats and basses.\n\n\nThe Sequencer\n\nThe stepsequencer visualises the rhythmic structure in a compact 4x4 square matrix, making it very easy to lay out patterns.\n\n\nThe Sampler\n\nBesides A/D envelope, loop function, start offset, tune and fine tune, the puristic sampler comes without effects. You can record up to 6 seconds via microphone or copy samples via iTunes.\n\n\nShare\n\nWith nanoloop for iPhone, you can send your saved projects to other nanoloop users and your own PC via e-mail. If nanoloop is installed on the recipient's iPhone / iPod, she/he can simply tap on the file name in the received e-mail to start nanoloop and import the attached file so that it is available for editing. This makes collaboration very easy, multiple users around the world can work on the same project by simply e-mailing the file.\n\n\nExport\n\nSongs can be exported to a WAV file that is accessible via iTunes (simply drag & drop files in finder). The exported file is also copied to the clipboard so that it can be pasted in other apps that support pasting audio. If a file sharing app like Dropbox is installed, you can upload the file there.\n\nMore information can be found at the nanoloop website: www.nanoloop.com"

      "label": "KQ Dixie is a 6-Operator FM synthesizer that is modeled on the synthesizer which appeared on the 1980s.\n\nFM synthesizers make sounds with Frequency Modulation.\nFM brings rich and brilliant sounds which are impossible to create with analog one.\nIt makes very complex waves with simple modulations.\nThe same method is used for radios.\nThe synthesizer gained much popularity in the 1980s.\n\nThis app lets you make sounds freely with 156 voice parameters.\nAlmost all parameters but multi-timbral, filter, and delay are compatible with DX7.\n\nAudio Unit v3 compatible. Multiple-Out is supported when you use \"KQ Dixie Multi\".\nAudiobus compatible.\nInter-App Audio compatible.\n32 algorithms included.\nYou can manage the hardware DX7 when it is connected with external MIDI cables.\nSupports DX7 System Exclusive Messages (SysEx) and syx files.\nSupports Zip files.

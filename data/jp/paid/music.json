You can also use the WIST function to play wirelessly with a friend using two devices simultaneously.\n\n● Powerful functions that bring infinite possibilities to your grooves\nWe’ve packed maximum potential into this machine with eight types of powerful master effects featured on the upper-level models of the ELECTRIBE. This includes the ring modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R and the cross-modulation function of the ELECTRIBE-R mkII. This app allows you to switch back and forth to choose between the two. It also includes the BEAT FLUTTER function that uses a proprietary randomizer to create fresh rhythms and the motion sequence function that remembers your knob movements. In addition, you can use an external USB-MIDI device such as the nanoPAD or nanoKONTROL for performance and control. There’s also support for the latest iOS technologies such as Inter-App Audio, Audiobus, Virtual MIDI, and iCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store.

      "label": "The next evolution in music software. Powerful wavetable sound. \nThe next generation ELECTRIBE produces state-of-the-art dance music.\n\nThe ELECTRIBE series first appeared in 1999. Since then each generation has inherited the iconic, intuitive operability of the original while incorporating the most up-to-date sounds and styles.\n\nThe ease of use, accessibility, sound and musicality of the ELECTRIBE reach new heights in this latest software version which features a powerful wavetable sound source, a “Quick Input” sequencer and a convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger. Even if you aren't a musical virtuoso, with ELECTRIBE Wave you can create state-of-the-art dance music like EDM, Future Bass, and Trap.\n\n• Powerful wavetable sound suitable for the latest in EDM\nELECTRIBE Wave has a sound wavetable featuring sounds widely used in the latest music creation. Unlike a PCM synth, the wavetable allows you to repeatedly play fragments of short waveforms, and change the waveform position during playback. By combining the wavetable (which features a rich variety of presets) with a powerful filter and two modulation units, you can create an infinite number of innovative and sharp sounds that cannot be produced using standard PCM synths. Even without a deep knowledge of synthesis techniques, the carefully selected parameters make it easy to craft your sound.\n\n• Improved user interface for quick composition\nThe familiar 16-step pad in the ELECTRIBE series enables speedy rhythm production. The ELECTRIBE Wave also features a new keyboard to play chords and scales. Even without musical knowledge, you can have fun making tracks without worrying about wrong notes. The sequencer features Groove, which can be used to breathe life into rhythm parts, as well as a special keyboard to enable smooth step input for synth parts on the graphical user interface.\n\n• Convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger\nELECTRIBE Wave features a chord pad that allows you to play  chords with one finger. If you use the \"Fetch\" function, it will automatically extract the chords from the song that you are in in the middle of creating and assign those chords to the pad for fast and easy song creation. You can also easily assign and save your favorite chords. In addition you can use the arpeggiator to create new phrases!\n\n• Motion Sequence records and plays temporal changes in sounds and effects\nThe ELECTRIBE series introduced a powerful motion sequence function that remembers and reproduces the movements of the knobs. ELECTRIBE Wave now offers this function for the synthesizer/drum parts so you can create a flow of sound overflowing with originality. If you use the built in KAOSS PAD you can change the sound to drastically with a single fingertip, easily storing and reproducing  temporal changes. Remember the wave table POSITION to make real time minute changes to the sound performance.\n\n• Song mode can combine patterns into finished songs\nUse song mode to create a new track by simply arranging the order of existing patterns. Using only the ELECTRIBE Wave, you can take a song all the way from inspiration to completion.

As seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nhttps://loopyapp.com\n\n-- “This is the best loop station on the iPhone” -- Dub FX (dubfx.net) \n-- “I pretty much own every mobile looper out there and Loopy is HANDS DOWN the best. Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support. Please contact me with questions, bug reports, feature ideas, and other feedback at support@atastypixel.com or https://forum.loopyapp.com. I may be able to fix your issue in less time than it would take to write a negative review!"

It features a unique \"fixed\" note wheel, which helps you to find the position of detected pitch easily. You can also use it as an electronic pitch pipe to tune by ear, matching the generated tones. \n\nIt is suitable for tuning acoustic or electric guitar and bass, ukulele, mandolin, banjo, bouzouki, bowed strings, woodwinds, brass, timpani and more. In fact, almost any instrument that sustains a tone can be tuned using insTuner. It supports Built-in Microphone as well as Line-in and other audio interface such as Apogee One.

It comes with a stereo modulator detune effect and covers the typical clean bells and Rhodes-like sounds, spheric pads, thick beats and basses.\n\n\nThe Sequencer\n\nThe stepsequencer visualises the rhythmic structure in a compact 4x4 square matrix, making it very easy to lay out patterns.\n\n\nThe Sampler\n\nBesides A/D envelope, loop function, start offset, tune and fine tune, the puristic sampler comes without effects. You can record up to 6 seconds via microphone or copy samples via iTunes.\n\n\nShare\n\nWith nanoloop for iPhone, you can send your saved projects to other nanoloop users and your own PC via e-mail. If nanoloop is installed on the recipient's iPhone / iPod, she/he can simply tap on the file name in the received e-mail to start nanoloop and import the attached file so that it is available for editing. This makes collaboration very easy, multiple users around the world can work on the same project by simply e-mailing the file.\n\n\nExport\n\nSongs can be exported to a WAV file that is accessible via iTunes (simply drag & drop files in finder). The exported file is also copied to the clipboard so that it can be pasted in other apps that support pasting audio. If a file sharing app like Dropbox is installed, you can upload the file there.\n\nMore information can be found at the nanoloop website: www.nanoloop.com"

      "label": "Benny Greb, well known for his contributions to the drumming education community, shared the approach that he has taken personally to develop his sense of groove and improve his own timing on his instrument in his course “The Art and Science of Groove”. Now with the Gap Click app, everyone can practice his method easily with a simple-to-use app! \n\nUnlike standard metronomes which simply state the time, Gap Click helps you improve your sense of time. Gap Click is more than a metronome with a focus on improving your ability to keep tempo, become more aware and comfortable with off beat clicks and by that, become bullet proof and accurate with all notes of the subdivision.\n\nGAP CLICK\nBy scrolling through the numbers of bars and patterns you can quickly configure a “gap” of time in which the metronome drops out. When the “one” comes back around, will your playing still be in time? How long of a gap can you play through and still maintain solid tempo?\n\nMOVING CLICK\nNext you can experiment with all kinds of off-beat patterns in the Gap Bar which moves the click from the downbeat position to a different location. Can you still play your instrument and maintain the downbeat internally even when you hear the click sound on an off-beat?\n\nBoth the “click” and the “gap” portion supports a variety of different syncopated patterns allowing you the ability to practice in binary or ternary rhythms - with more or less safety net depending on your settings.\n\nFeatures\n• Ability to choose from a variety of different syncopated patterns and # of measures for both the standard \"click\" as well as the \"gap\"\n• Use the nostalgic click wheel to find the right tempo or tap to set your desired tempo from 10 to 300bpm\n• Standard quarter-note time signatures: 2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4\n\nPersonalize\n• See visual feedback for each note or rest that is played\n• Accent beat 1 of each measure or turn accents off for a greater challenge\n• Flash the screen for a visual indication when switching from the \"click\" to the \"gap\"\n• Find your favorite sound from a variety of click samples hand-picked by Benny\n\nBuy Once, Use Forever\n• There are no In-App Purchases - a one time purchase includes all current and future features. \n\nTESTIMONIALS\nWhat professionals are saying about GAP CLICK:\n• \"The skills you can sharpen by using this app are integral for what it takes to be a professional drummer in any genre.\" - Matt Halpern\n• \"When I first opened the app, it made (simple) sense, without a tutorial.\" - Chris Coleman\n• \"This app helps you lock in the pocket on a whole different level.\" - Luke Holland\n• \"The Gap Click app is something that every drummer should have in their toolbox.\" - Jared Falk, Drumeo\n\nWhat our users are saying about GAP CLICK: \n• \"If you think you have good timing, this will really put you in your place.\"\n• \"Gone are the days of programming gap clicks!\"\n• \"I’ve never had so much fun being destroyed in my practice session.\"\n• \"This is by far the best money I’ve ever spent on a practice tool.\"\n\nABOUT BENNY GREB\nBenny Greb is one of the most respected drummers in the world today. Not only has he headlined nearly every major drum festival and toured with his clinics and drum camps worldwide, but he is also recognized as a composer and bandleader in his own band Moving Parts, which won him the renowned “ECHO Jazz” award - the German equivalent to The Grammys in jazz.\n\nBenny Greb published two of the most successful and critically acclaimed educational products, “The Language of Drumming” and “The Art and Science of Groove” and he has helped create many signature products available to drummers today.\n\nFind him online at https://www.bennygreb.de as well as on social media."

      "label": "The latest title in the KORG DS-10 series, now available for the iOS!\n\nThe KORG DS-10 series was an enormous hit for the Nintendo DS. Now, seven years later, it has undergone a further evolution while staying true to its original spirit. Now available is the KORG iDS-10, a portable synthesizer studio for iOS. \n\nThe KORG iDS-10 combines a cutting-edge analog synthesizer, voice synthesizer, and analog drum machine inspired by motifs from the original KORG DS-10. This iOS app gives you a hand-held system to easily create electronic music, which requires persuasive sound with a minimal number of notes.\n\n*** Powerful analog synthesizer lets you visually learn sound design ***\nThe analog synthesizer provides carefully selected parameters, making it easy to enjoy sound design. The unique patching function also lets you create sound in even deeper ways. Since all parameters can be automated, you have a wide range of song-production possibilities. Each synthesizer provides five types of effect with an oscilloscope that helps you see the sound. This cutting-edge synth engine takes full advantage of the iOS device’s CPU to generate astonishing sound, and will heighten your enjoyment using the KORG DS-10.\n\n*** Enter your lyrics, and the voice synthesizer turns them into a voice ***\nThe voice synthesizer is one of the popular features of the KORG iDS-10. Based on a vocoder, its engine makes it easy to generate voices. It also supports input via a microphone which can be used as a conventional vocoder. The parameters are optimized for creating such voices, so you’ll be able to enjoy sound design with a different character than an analog synthesizer, further widening the possibilities for your music.\n\n*** Analog drum synthesizer makes it easy to produce the sounds that you want ***\nDrums are now more important than ever, and the iDS-10 provides an analog drum machine that’s carefully tuned for easy creation of powerful sounds. With total control over six drum sounds (kick, snare, hihat1 / ihat2, tom, and percussion), you can create awesome tracks with high impact.\n\n*** Smart keyboard and KAOSS mode make step-recording enjoyable ***\nThe smart keyboard lets you specify a scale so that you can step-record without worrying about “wrong” notes. And of course there’s also KAOSS mode, where you can produce a limitless range of great-sounding phrases, with just a touch of the keyboard. The scale setting is also applied to the sequencer’s note display, so you can enjoy producing songs whether or not you have any musical knowledge or experience.\n\n*** Pattern play that you can perform in real time ***\nThe pattern play capability of the KORG DS10 has further evolved, generating amazing user performances. You can seamlessly play 32 patterns, and also manipulate track mute and solo settings in real time. It’s guaranteed to result in the kind of protean acts that are notable in modern day DJ performances.\n\n*** Send your songs by email for collaborative music productions ***\nThere’s a function that allows the transfer of song data via email, making it easy to exchange songs with your friends.\n\n*** Mystery bingo!? ***\nAnd then there’s the enigmatic mystery bingo; as you continue enjoying the KORG iDS-10, the full picture will become clearer …\n\nThis app was produced in cooperation with the game music and app production company “Detune.” Don’t miss this opportunity to experience the world of the KORG iDS-10 that resulted from this collaboration with Detune Inc.\n\nThe first title in the KORG DS-10 series was the KORG DS-10 which was announced in 2008. The second title was the KORG DS-10 PLUS which launched in 2009.\nThese are products of Marvelous Inc.

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

      "label": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis"

      "label": "An upright piano sits perfectly in pop, R&B, Hip-Hop, and many more modern music genres. That’s why it’s heard in countless iconic tracks throughout musical history with the upright at the heart of the song. You don’t always need the splendor of a grand piano but the character and immediacy of an upright piano. Pure Upright captures the uniquely recognizable sound of the upright piano and makes it as wonderfully playable as our acclaimed Pure Piano for iOS. \n\nSimilar to an XY pad in its flat, tactile nature, the Morph Pad offers up nine different core upright piano timbres, including Vintage, Intimate, Reverse, Gated, and Pad, to name a few. The “pure” Upright sits untouched at the heart and center of the space, surrounded by eight more presets for you to explore as you guide your finger seamlessly through the wide-ranging tonal palette of the piano. As you do so, the various timbres blend together, allowing you to create your own sounds comprising combinations of neighboring presets for you to save and recall. \n\nPure Upright works as a standalone app or as an AUv3 plug-in within your DAW of choice, and extensive connectivity options allow you to easily connect to your keyboard controller via USB, direct, or Bluetooth MIDI to experience the sound of a professional grand piano through your headphones or speakers. The app also supports a direct connection to your Mac using Inter Device Audio (IDAM). This enables you to easily integrate Pure Upright into your desktop projects by sending MIDI and receiving audio with one single cable, as well as network MIDI and Inter-App Audio for triggering the piano from other apps that you might have installed.\n\nEquipped with customizable reverb, EQ, and delay, sound creation becomes even more creative. Simply unlink any of the audio effects from the Morph Pad to dial in your own settings. Maybe you want to add a long reverb tail to add some extra atmosphere, tweak the EQ a little or add some delay to a particular sound. It’s up to you.\n\nIf all that isn’t enough, now you can adjust the pedal and key noise to taste, and there’s a host of flexible tuning options for when you need them. The stretched piano tuning is how a piano technician would tune the piano. The equal temperament tuning, on the other hand, is best for when layering Pure Upright with sounds like electric pianos, pads, or strings. Also provided is the ability to transpose the piano which comes in very useful if you are working with a vocalist who wants to sing in a different key!\n\nFor the best experience with Pure Upright, we highly recommend using a controller keyboard to trigger the notes so that it feels like you’re playing a real upright piano. The on-board velocity response page allows you to match the dynamic response of Pure Upright to your keyboard controller and your playing style so that you can achieve the right velocity response for you and the song you’re playing. \n\nPure Upright is designed and developed by Hamburg-based e-instruments, renowned for their high-end digital recreations of acoustic instruments.\n\nFeature Overview:\n\n- Interactive Morph Pad - Explore the different characteristics of the upright piano \n\n- Nine different sounds - Navigate and blend between nine core sounds\n\n- Studio Quality Audio at Ultra-low Latency\n\n- Extensive Connectivity - Connect via USB, direct, or Bluetooth MIDI. Inter Device Audio (IDAM), Network MIDI, and Inter-App Audio also fully supported\n\n- Standalone and AUv3 plug-in compatible\n\n- Zynaptiq QREV Reverb - Have fun adding extra atmosphere and depth to your sound\n\n- 3-Band EQ and Delay - Get creative with customizable EQ and Delay, or use the Morph Pad as a macro control\n\n- Save, Load & Share Your Own Sound Presets \n\n- Flexible Tuning Options  \n\n- Customizable velocity curve \n\n- 24-bit, 44.1 kHz\n\n- 1.1GB installation"

Then you can pick a section from the generated section list and listen to any part of the song.\n\nFor each section title, you can enter multiple lines of text. As a result, in addition to verse/chorus labels, you can make notes about the chord progression, measure count, lyrics, and so on, offering a tool that you can use for many purposes.\n\nPlaySections supports section and song loop playback, allowing you to listen to your favorite section on loop. It also features useful functionality including tempo/playback speed adjustment, pitch shift, vocal cancellation, 7 band equalizer, and flip video, making it a perfect app to use in instrument, vocal, or dance practice, or when playing music by ear.\n\nNot only can it read files from the iOS Music Library, but by using the Share Extension/Open-in functionality, you can import files from other applications. For example, you can load a recording from the Voice Memo app that comes standard on the iPhone, letting you create and play back a section list for a song that you performed yourself. Even more, you can use it to study a new language, or to prepare meeting notes. Version 4.0.0 adds support for YouTube videos.\n\nMany uses\n- Set marks for intro, verses, chorus, instrumental solo\n- Set chord progressions and lyrics for each section\n- Practice of playing musical instruments, singing, and dancing\n- Analyze music structure, chords for music dictation\n- Great for language learners, transcription from audio files of meeting/conference\n\nFeature Highlights\n- Music Library Integration\n- YouTube video\n- Waveform scroll\n- Section Marks\n- Section title edit\n- Loop playback (section, song)\n- Speed control (-50% to +200%) *\n- Pitch control (-12 to +12) **\n- 7 bands EQ control (-24dB to +12dB) **\n- FX (vocal cancel) **\n- Flip Video (except for YouTube videos)\n- Share Extension, Open-in support (File import)\n- Remote control, AirTurn support\n- Low latency playback (Audio Unit support)\n- Supports all major audio/video formats (AAC, MP3, WAV, AIFF, FLAC [requires iOS 11], MP4, MOV...)\n- Background playback (except for YouTube videos)\n- VoiceOver\n- Drag & Drop on iPad\n- Inter-App Audio, Audiobus**\n\n* No support for DRM contents (Apple Music, ...)\n** No support for Video and DRM contents\n\nSupport\nhttp://playsections.github.io/\nhttps://twitter.com/PlaySections\nplaysections@gmail.com\n\n---\nVideo by TRIAMPERSANDY - ROLLY-POP\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RC_rV_dCCg"

      "label": "Brusfri* is a highly advanced audio noise reducer, packed into a simple and straight-forward interface. It is very well suited for cleaning up noisy audio recordings, while retaining sound quality. Unlike many other noise reducers on the market, Brusfri doesn't mess with audio phasing to suppress noise (a technique that often comes with audible side effects). Instead, multiple fine-tuned gates are used to silence unwanted noise.\n\nBrusfri can also be used as a AUv3 plug-in in compatible hosts, for example in GarageBand.\n\n*Brusfri means \"Noise free\" in Swedish.\n\nHere are some examples of sound conditions that Brusfri handles well:\n\n* Guitar amp\n* Noisy vintage gear\n* Boosted pre-amp\n* iPhone/iPad and external mic hiss\n* Room reverb removal\n* Fan noise\n* Background ambiance\n* Mains hum / Electric hum\n\nUsage\n\nIn short, press “Learn” during a couple of seconds of isolated noise to create a \"profile\" for noise. This may be all you need to do.\n\nBrusfri can be used in two ways, either standalone or as a AUv3 plug-in.\n\nStandalone\nImport the audio, either by extracting audio from a video, by importing from iTunes, or by using the “Open In…” option in any other app that can export audio. Press and hold the Learn button (the ear) while playing unwanted noise. (It’s important that the Ear is only fed with isolated noise). When Learn is released, Brusfri will start reducing noise. \n\nAUv3 plug-in\nOpen Brusfri in any AUv3 compatible host.\nFind a region in the recording that only contains noise and play it. \nTap and hold the “LEARN” button for a short while (a second will be enough). When the LEARN button is released, Brusfri will start reducing noise.\n\nThere are a bunch of parameters available that affect the noise reduction algorithm:\n\nATK / THRS / REL (Attack Time / Threshold / Release Time)\nThreshold - basically determines how much noise to be removed. A lower value means more reduction.\nAttack and Release sets the time it will take for the reducer to start working.\n\nLOOKAHEAD\nMakes transient processing a bit smoother.\n\nEDGE\nControls the reduction aggressivity. A lower value gives a smoother reduction.\n\nHPF\nReduces low frequencies.\n\nHIGH\nCompensates high frequencies by boosting them.\n\nMIX\nMixes between dry and noise reduced signal.\n\nNOTE! Brusfri is CPU intensive and iPhone 6 / iPad AIR 2 or better is recommended. When used as an AUv3 plug-in, we highly recommend freezing/bouncing tracks to reduce CPU usage."

      "label": "[Compatible devices] iPhone6 or later(Except for the iPhone SE).\n\r\n[System requirements] iOS 11.0 or later required.\n\nAn easy way to create your own original tunes!\n\nChordana Composer makes it easy for you to write your own tunes, even if you don't know how to compose music.\nYou can enter a motif (two-bar melody) using your choice of 3 input modes. There's no need to enter the melody for the entire tune. \nYou just enter one motif and Chordana Composer automatically creates a whole tune, so you don't have to spend ages composing the music.\n\nProduct Features\n\n1. Three ways to enter your motif (2-bar melody)　\n\n　A melody that comes to you in the middle of an ordinary day...\nHave you ever thought: “This would make a really great tune.\nBut I need to know how to compose, and it's no good if I can't read music. And that all takes time to learn”?\nChordana Composer will take care of all those concerns.\nJust enter 2 bars of the motif you thought of.\nChordana Composer will automatically make it into an entire tune.\n　You can choose from 3 types of input method.\nIn \"Keyboard input mode\" you use a virtual keyboard, in \"Notation input mode, you paste the notes into a sheet of music, and in \"Microphone input mode\", you just sing the motif into the microphone.\n\n2. Automatic composition by choosing \"Genre\" and \"Concept\"\n\n　Once you've entered the melody using one of the modes above, you're ready for automatic composition.\nChoose whichever combination of \"Genre\", \"Concept\", \"Range of melody movement\" and \"Level of melody tension\" creates a tune that best matches what you've imagined.\n\n3. Your own editing using the Hints function  \n In Notation input mode, you can edit the the created melody yourself.\nIf you enable the Hints function when you're editing the tune, the notation is color coded as a reference for your edits (notes that match the chord, notes in the same scale, notes that increase the tension and other notes you need to be aware of).\n\n4. Using simple steps, you can upload your finished tune as a video to YouTube along with the staff notation, or slideshow of photos. You can also send your tunes as email attachments in AAC or MIDI format, and it's really easy to make your own ringtones*1 too.\n*1: To use your tune as an iPhone ringtone, you need to connect to a Mac or Windows computer and transfer the tune to your iPhone via iTunes."

Super simple interface with powerful features.” -- J. Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

      "label": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals."

RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools."

You don't need to operate the app.\r\n-You can also measure only where necessary.  You can choose the start position and end position of measurement freely.\r\n-The measured results are shown on the chart as the tuning curve for the theoretical Twelve-tone equal temperament.\r\n\r\n◆ Professional accuracy\r\n-This app uses the iPhone's microphone to scan the pitch 100 times per second.\r\n-The scanned pitch data is filtered by mathematical analysis, including eliminating abnormal value and average value. The measurement results are displayed in 0.1 cent units.  We have achieved more accurate and stable pitch analysis performance than the general music tuner.\r\n\r\n◆ Basic functions\r\n\r\n-The upper red bar chart shows the pitch deviation caused by pitch fluctuation and coordination deviation, and the lower blue bar chart shows the actual pitch deviation (0.1 point unit) related to the theoretical Twelve-tone equal temperament pitch.\r\n\r\nThe reference pitch can be set in 0.5Hz increments in the range of A = 430 to 450Hz.\r\n\r\n◆ How to think about the Railsback-curve\r\nAccording to the physical characteristics of the piano, the pitch of the high note is slightly higher, and the pitch of the low note is slightly lower, which is generally inconsistent with the theoretical Twelve-tone equal temperament. Drawing a graph of the degree of inconsistency is called a Railsback-curve.\r\nTherefore, the pitches of the low and high frequencies after tuning generally do not match the theoretical Twelve-tone equal temperament.\r\nIn addition, the degree of this Railsback-curve differs depending on the basic specifications such as the length of each piano's music wire and the diameter of them, and there are also parts that differ depending on the policy of each tuner, so there is no \"absolute\" or \"correct answer\" in the tuning of the piano. ..\r\nPlease use this app as a tool to check daily changes in piano conditions.\r\n* Please refer to the tuning graph in the sample screenshot as an example of proper stretch tuning.\r\n\r\n◆ Caution\r\n-according to the condition of the piano and the measurement environment, if the measurement starts from the bass and treble, the pitch may not be detected correctly.\r\nIn this case, the measurement starts in two steps, from the middle to the high end, and from the middle to the low end.\r\n-Due to the short attenuation time of the treble part, it may not be possible to complete the measurement by one keystroke. In this case, press the key several times until the measurement is completed.\r\n\r\nIt has been proven to work on iPhone 7 or later."

      "label": "Brusfri* is a highly advanced audio noise reducer, packed into a simple and straight-forward interface. It is very well suited for cleaning up noisy audio recordings, while retaining sound quality. Unlike many other noise reducers on the market, Brusfri doesn't mess with audio phasing to suppress noise (a technique that often comes with audible side effects). Instead, multiple fine-tuned gates are used to silence unwanted noise.\n\nBrusfri can also be used as a AUv3 plug-in in compatible hosts, for example in GarageBand.\n\n*Brusfri means \"Noise free\" in Swedish.\n\nHere are some examples of sound conditions that Brusfri handles well:\n\n* Guitar amp\n* Noisy vintage gear\n* Boosted pre-amp\n* iPhone/iPad and external mic hiss\n* Room reverb removal\n* Fan noise\n* Background ambiance\n* Mains hum / Electric hum\n\nUsage\n\nIn short, press “Learn” during a couple of seconds of isolated noise to create a \"profile\" for noise. This may be all you need to do.\n\nBrusfri can be used in two ways, either standalone or as a AUv3 plug-in.\n\nStandalone\nImport the audio, either by extracting audio from a video, by importing from iTunes, or by using the “Open In…” option in any other app that can export audio. Press and hold the Learn button (the ear) while playing unwanted noise. (It’s important that the Ear is only fed with isolated noise). When Learn is released, Brusfri will start reducing noise. \n\nAUv3 plug-in\nOpen Brusfri in any AUv3 compatible host.\nFind a region in the recording that only contains noise and play it. \nTap and hold the “LEARN” button for a short while (a second will be enough). When the LEARN button is released, Brusfri will start reducing noise.\n\nThere are a bunch of parameters available that affect the noise reduction algorithm:\n\nATK / THRS / REL (Attack Time / Threshold / Release Time)\nThreshold - basically determines how much noise to be removed. A lower value means more reduction.\nAttack and Release sets the time it will take for the reducer to start working.\n\nLOOKAHEAD\nMakes transient processing a bit smoother.\n\nEDGE\nControls the reduction aggressivity. A lower value gives a smoother reduction.\n\nHPF\nReduces low frequencies.\n\nHIGH\nCompensates high frequencies by boosting them.\n\nMIX\nMixes between dry and noise reduced signal.\n\nNOTE! Brusfri is CPU intensive and iPhone 6 / iPad AIR 2 or better is recommended. When used as an AUv3 plug-in, we highly recommend freezing/bouncing tracks to reduce CPU usage."

      "label": "Touch Notation is a powerful musical score creation app that allows anyone to enjoy writing music using touch gestures.\n\nIn Japan, Touch Notation was selected as one of the ‘App Store Best of 2014’ apps, and held the No.1 spot in the iPad Paid App index for music apps for over two weeks.\n\nUp until now, musical score creation software has relied upon dragging individual notes from a palette onto staves.  By contrast, Touch Notation allows musicians to draw directly onto the score using a finger or touch pen, and have their work immediately appear as beautifully written notation, then played back using the app’s 30 built-in instrument voices.\n\n-\tA wide-range of functions accessible from a cleanly designed, intuitive user interface.\n-\tAbility to enter musical expressions for adjusting tempo and dynamics.\n-\tLayout functions such as page breaks.\n-\tConvenient transpose feature for raising/lowering the pitch of the entire score.\n-\tOutput scores using Air Print, or save to Dropbox in PDF, SMF, MusicXML, and ScoreMaker formats.\n\nTouch Notation allows the following musical symbols to be entered by hand:\n\n-\tNote, Rest (including dotted and double-dotted), Long Rest, Beam, Tuplet (Triplet)\n-\tGrace Note\n-\tAccidental, Tie, Slur\n-\tAccent, Staccato, Tenuto, Fermata\n-\tTrill, sfz, Arpeggio, Pedal, Senza\n-\tMetronome symbol\n-\tCrescendo, Decrescendo\n-\tDynamics symbols (ppp~fff)\n-\tOctave symbol\n-\tRepeat brackets\n-\tRepeat marks (D.C./Fine/D.S./Segno/Coda/to Coda)\n-\tClefs (Treble Clef/Bass Clef/C Clef/Percussion Clef)\n-\tKey signature\n-\tTime signature\n-\tBar lines (repeat marks)\n-      Abbreviation\n\nLyrics and other musical expressions (‘Dolce’, ‘Tranquillo’, etc.) can be added using text input, while comments and memos can also be written freehand directly onto the score.\n\n* Drum notation is supported, but other types such as rhythm notation and tab notation are not supported.\n* Older devices may experience stuttering when playing complicated scores with many simultaneous notes."

Synchronized editing.\n\nMultiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing.

For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.\n\nThis is only the beginning...\n\nWe've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point and we're planning to do the same for this new version.

Tap, flip and rotate simple shapes to explore complex polyrhythms. Gestural control of beat distribution algorithms allows for the step-by-step generation of rhythmic shapes. Layer intricate beats in a matter of minutes, then save them for later or export to MIDI.\n\n- Build rhythms on up to four necklaces.\n- Adjust the length of each individual cycle to quickly create complex rhythmic ratios\n- Use a collection of rhythm building algorithms and geometric transformations to create and morph your rhythm.\n-Tap your tempo, use a slider for transitions, or manually type the global speed of your song\n- Choose from a variety of pitched sounds and percussive sample sets.\n- Quickly modulate between notes in four musical modes (pentatonic, major, minor, chromatic) and five octaves.\n- Customize the attack and panning of sounds to suit your composition\n- Save your sessions and export them as midi. \n- E-mail copies of midi sessions to yourself. These can be opened and edited on most DAWs.\n- Midi in/out allows you to fully customize your sounds and record your compositions in real time within an external DAW environment.\n\nThe term ‘rhythm necklace’ is used in music to refer to circular representations of repeating patterns. By thinking about rhythms as shapes rather than a linear timeline, it’s easier to see geometric properties that make them enjoyable, such as evenness and symmetry. Often, even subtle changes to the visual interface can completely transform how a rhythm sounds. Rhythm Necklace is a tool for both advanced and novice musicians alike, as well as anyone who wants to think about rhythms in a new way."

      "label": "Tune Maker is a music composition tool which helps you to understand the basic components of music and to quickly begin creating your own compositions.\n\nTune Maker can be used by musicians of all levels. Beginners can start using basic chords, rhythms and melodies. Professional musicians will appreciate the ability to construct very advanced chords, using non-standard time signatures, adding multiple melody lines, MIDI export, recording chords and notes from a MIDI keyboard and many more. \n\nFEEL THE BEAT\nThere is not any strict sequence of steps in music composition, but if you are just starting, you can begin by adding some drums to your tune. It will create a basic structure of the future composition.\n\nHEAR THE MELODY\nTry to hear a melody in your head or sing it first. Then start drawing it on the melody track canvas. Hit Play and listen while you are working on it. To make it more dynamic, use the velocity tool to adjust volume of individual notes.\n\nHARMONIZE\nIn music, the process of adding chords to a melody is called harmonization. Tune Maker allows you to construct almost any possible chord and it will help you to find chords that mach your melody.\n\nANIMATE CHORDS WITH AN ARPEGGIO\nIn Tune Maker, an arpeggio track is a rhythmic pattern for your chord progression. You can think of it as a right hand pattern when you play on a guitar. It can be like strumming, bass & chord or a single-note pattern. Tune Maker automatically maps this pattern to your chords and produces appropriate note pitches.\n\nRECORD YOUR PERFORMANCE\nEnable recording and start playing on the note editor's scale buttons or use your MIDI controller connected over USB of Bluetooth. You can also record chords with your MIDI keyboard. Tune Maker will recognize chords you are playing and insert them to the chord track.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR INSTRUMENTS\nSelect an instrument from the built-in collection. Play CoreMIDI-compatible apps. Or plug in any Audio Unit Extension Instrument available on the App Store.\n\nBUILD A COMPLETE SONG\nYou can duplicate an existing section and add some alterations to it or you can just repeat a section. For example, if you have some kind of chorus section in your song, you could repeat it in multiple places inside your song. And if you decide to modify this section later, the changes will affect all the repeats.\n\nORGANIZE, SHARE & EXPORT\nTune Maker is a Document Based App. This allows you to organize your projects in the way that works best for you. You can store your projects on a local folder, on iCloud Drive, or on any other supported cloud storage like DropBox or GoogleDrive. You can share easily using AirDrop, Mail or Message. You can also export your project as a MIDI file if you want to continue working on it in a DAW like Ableton or GarageBand."

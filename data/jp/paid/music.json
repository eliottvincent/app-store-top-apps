And that all takes time to learn”?\nChordana Composer will take care of all those concerns.\nJust enter 2 bars of the motif you thought of.\nChordana Composer will automatically make it into an entire tune.\n　You can choose from 3 types of input method.\nIn \"Keyboard input mode\" you use a virtual keyboard, in \"Notation input mode, you paste the notes into a sheet of music, and in \"Microphone input mode\", you just sing the motif into the microphone.\n\n2. Automatic composition by choosing \"Genre\" and \"Concept\"\n\n　Once you've entered the melody using one of the modes above, you're ready for automatic composition.\nChoose whichever combination of \"Genre\", \"Concept\", \"Range of melody movement\" and \"Level of melody tension\" creates a tune that best matches what you've imagined.\n\n3. Your own editing using the Hints function  \n In Notation input mode, you can edit the the created melody yourself.\nIf you enable the Hints function when you're editing the tune, the notation is color coded as a reference for your edits (notes that match the chord, notes in the same scale, notes that increase the tension and other notes you need to be aware of).\n\n4. Using simple steps, you can upload your finished tune as a video to YouTube along with the staff notation, or slideshow of photos. You can also send your tunes as email attachments in AAC or MIDI format, and it's really easy to make your own ringtones*1 too.\n*1: To use your tune as an iPhone ringtone, you need to connect to a Mac or Windows computer and transfer the tune to your iPhone via iTunes."

Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have. Plus, a sophisticated interactive tutorial system lets users discover Loopy's more advanced features at their own pace. \n\nRECORD & LAYER\n\n- Six, nine, or twelve beautifully rendered circular loops, with simple yet powerful controls. \n- Count-in, count-out and record chaining lets you keep your hands free to play an instrument.\n- MIDI control, to control Loopy via foot pedal or other controller.\n- Overdub, to build beautiful, complex soundscapes from many layers. \n- Support for tracks of any multiple or fraction of a beat, for flexible and expressive looping. \n- Sophisticated audio or visual metronome to keep you in time - no matter what time signature you choose. \n- Perfectly synchronized, low latency audio engine. \n- Robust MIDI clock receive and send, and support for Ableton Link.\n\nIMPORT & CONSTRUCT \n\n- Import loops from your computer via iTunes, with support for AIFF, WAV, MP3, M4A, CAF and more. \n- Bring in audio from many other audio apps with integrated audio copy and paste. \n- Imported loops are automatically fit to your beat, no matter what tempo. \n\nMANIPULATE & TWEAK \n\n- Full stereo audio, with pan controls for each track to create custom stereoscapes. \n- Fix up timing by twisting tracks around to line up the beat, or make funky sound effects with dynamic time shifting. \n- Drag a track onto another track to merge tracks, and clear up a space. \n- Live, dynamic tempo adjustment to speed up or slow down your creations, without altering the pitch. \n- MIDI clock sync, to play in time with other MIDI-capable devices or apps.\n\nPERFORM & SHARE \n\n- Record whole performances with in-app session recording facilities. \n- Upload performances or single loops straight to SoundCloud, and post to Twitter or Facebook.\n- Email audio clips.\n- Share audio with many other audio apps with audio copy and paste. \n- Transfer loops or performances to your computer via iTunes. \n\n-----\n\nLoopy is developed by one guy who loves making great apps, and who is dedicated to responsive development and support.

      "label": "The next evolution in music software. Powerful wavetable sound. \nThe next generation ELECTRIBE produces state-of-the-art dance music.\n\nThe ELECTRIBE series first appeared in 1999. Since then each generation has inherited the iconic, intuitive operability of the original while incorporating the most up-to-date sounds and styles.\n\nThe ease of use, accessibility, sound and musicality of the ELECTRIBE reach new heights in this latest software version which features a powerful wavetable sound source, a “Quick Input” sequencer and a convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger. Even if you aren't a musical virtuoso, with ELECTRIBE Wave you can create state-of-the-art dance music like EDM, Future Bass, and Trap.\n\n• Powerful wavetable sound suitable for the latest in EDM\nELECTRIBE Wave has a sound wavetable featuring sounds widely used in the latest music creation. Unlike a PCM synth, the wavetable allows you to repeatedly play fragments of short waveforms, and change the waveform position during playback. By combining the wavetable (which features a rich variety of presets) with a powerful filter and two modulation units, you can create an infinite number of innovative and sharp sounds that cannot be produced using standard PCM synths. Even without a deep knowledge of synthesis techniques, the carefully selected parameters make it easy to craft your sound.\n\n• Improved user interface for quick composition\nThe familiar 16-step pad in the ELECTRIBE series enables speedy rhythm production. The ELECTRIBE Wave also features a new keyboard to play chords and scales. Even without musical knowledge, you can have fun making tracks without worrying about wrong notes. The sequencer features Groove, which can be used to breathe life into rhythm parts, as well as a special keyboard to enable smooth step input for synth parts on the graphical user interface.\n\n• Convenient chord pad that allows you to play a chord with one finger\nELECTRIBE Wave features a chord pad that allows you to play  chords with one finger. If you use the \"Fetch\" function, it will automatically extract the chords from the song that you are in in the middle of creating and assign those chords to the pad for fast and easy song creation. You can also easily assign and save your favorite chords. In addition you can use the arpeggiator to create new phrases!\n\n• Motion Sequence records and plays temporal changes in sounds and effects\nThe ELECTRIBE series introduced a powerful motion sequence function that remembers and reproduces the movements of the knobs. ELECTRIBE Wave now offers this function for the synthesizer/drum parts so you can create a flow of sound overflowing with originality. If you use the built in KAOSS PAD you can change the sound to drastically with a single fingertip, easily storing and reproducing  temporal changes. Remember the wave table POSITION to make real time minute changes to the sound performance.\n\n• Song mode can combine patterns into finished songs\nUse song mode to create a new track by simply arranging the order of existing patterns. Using only the ELECTRIBE Wave, you can take a song all the way from inspiration to completion. With audio file export, you can send a complete song or individual patterns to your favorite DAW, or upload to services like SoundCloud.\n\nMore info at korg.com"

      "label": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store. If you have questions and/or suggestions, feel free to contact me via e-mail or facebook."

      "label": "\"BEGIN's Uta San-Shin,\" is an application for everyone to enjoy easily playing songs with the Okinawan band, BEGIN, on the Okinawan instrument, the San-Shin.\nBecause the San-Shin is fretless, if the player doesn't press the stings at exactly the right place, beautiful melodies won't emerge from the instrument.  The right positions are known as, \"Kan-Dokoro.\"  These, \"Kan-Dokoro,\" are shown through a score of Chinese characters known as, \"Kun-Kun-Shi,\"  which is displayed on the left side of the app to allow the player to easily master the basics of the game.\nIn Free-Play mode, while pressing the Kan-Dokoro and stroking the tap area, the user can experience the feel of truly playing the San-Shin with this app.\nFurthermore, in Singing-San-Shin mode, along with the Kan-Dokoro appear original Japanese lyrics, so the player can sing while playing!\nBecause the tempo and key can be adjusted to the player's level, everyone can eventually master the San-Shin.  When the player can stroke at the same speed as the members of BEGIN, they've become a master!\nAdditionally in the, \"Ai no Te,\" corner, BEGIN's music includes both, \"Ai no Te,\" and, \"Yubi-Bue,\" indispensable parts of Okinawan music.  Press, swing, and rock out!\nFor all lover's of Okinawa, this is an app for anyone to enjoy learning the San-Shin, or just having a great time while drinking with friends.\n\n*All sampling was performed by BEGIN.\n\nSongs included in Version 1.5.0:\n○Usagi to Kame\n○Urashima Taro\n○Tinsagu no hana\n○Kankara San-shin umushirumun\n○Nada sousou\n○Shimanchu no takara\n○Pamaya Yunta\n○Sanshin no Hana\n○Irayoi Tsukiyohama\n○Taketomijima de Aimasyou (Ver 1.3.0)\n○Ojii jiman no Orion beer (Ver 1.3.0)\n○Kariyushi no yoru (Ver 1.4.0)\n○Uruma Melody (Ver 1.5.0)\n○Umi no Koe (Ver 1.5.0)\n\nSinging-San-Shin Menu\n---------------------------------\n\n[Singing-San-Shin Mode]\nIn Singing-San-Shin mode, lyrics appear with the Kan-Dokoro.  Learn the San-Shin while singing!\n\n[Role-Model Mode]\nAutomatically plays along with the Kun-Kun-Shi score.  The recommended tempo is displayed in the lower left part of the screen, the tempo can be adjusted in the settings, and memorize at your own pace. \n\n[Practice Mode]\nThe Kan-Dokoro light up, press them while playing.\n*If the correct Kan-Dokoro aren't pressed, the next Kan-Dokoro won't be displayed.\n\n[Challenge Mode]\nThe Kun-Kun-Shi score scrolls along the tempo set in the settings while the Kan-Dokoro light up.  Try to play along with the tempo!\n\n[BEGIN Sessions]\nBring it all together!  Play along with BEGIN's original songs.\n*Tempo and key adjusts automatically to these original songs. \n\nFree-Play Mode\n----------------------\nIn Free-Play Mode, press Kan-Dokoro and play like a real San-Shin.\n\nAi no Te\n-----------\nThe band BEGIN's original Ai no Te, swing your i-phone while using your favourite Ai no Te!"

Made of aluminum and glass, Metronome Touch proves a huge statement: It is as exclusive as your device. Launching Metronome Touch, your device will become a metronome.\n\nAnyone can try to make a metronome app, but success only comes when listening to customers. That's why Metronome Touch centers around functions that musicians are looking for: The ability to tap a beat, use customizable presets to save your favorite sets (bpm, time signature and accentuation), and multiple useful ways of adjusting the bpm. Metronome Touch even goes far beyond that: Neither analog nor digital metronomes can synchronize pendulums. But Metronome Touch can.

You will gain your student's attention when using this outstanding technology. If you have ever been on stage with bad acoustics, you will love Metronome Touch: It will provide every single band member with a perfect steady and synchronized rhythm on stage. Even when recording a song in separate soundproofed rooms, Metronome Touch keeps you in perfect sync.\n\nEasily adjust Metronome Touch to your likes and needs with the light or dark design - relying on absolute clear vector-based display graphics  - and many well chosen professional metronome sounds.\n\nMetronome Touch is constantly being developed further to ensure the highest customer satisfaction.\n\nFEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY\n\n• Precise engine \nA completely new developed engine makes this app one of the most precise pendulum metronomes available on the App Store. Highest accuracy is supported on all iOS devices.\n\n• Ableton Link synchronization technology\n Metronome Touch was the first metronome worldwide offering pendulum synchronization on iOS devices. You can keep band members‘ metronomes or a whole orchestra in sync.\nAbleton Link provides new ways of practicing together or in a group. \n\n • Memory function\n There is an infinite number of customizable presets to save your favorite sets of bpm, time signature and accentuation.\n\n • Numerical entry\nUsing bpm display let you directly enter tempo values from 20 up to 999 bpm.\n\n• Tap2bpm \nUse the tap field that will interpret your finger taps as bpm.\n\n• Beat count and accentuation\n Choose a beat count from 1 up to 12 beats and free customizable accentuation.\n\n• Styles and sounds\n Customize Metronome Touch to your likes and needs.

      "label": "The extreme delay machine that you've never heard before.\n\nIn short:  This is a Karaoke echo machine.  Words spoken in the iPhone's microphone will come back a few seconds later.  It's like the echo effect you can hear at a mountain.  You can get various kinds of effects by changing the delay time and the feedback rate.\n\nTo make music:  Tap on the table - it sounds like \"tock\"......\"tock\".....\"tock\"..... Clap your hands - you'll hear \"tock\", \"clap\", \"tock\", \"clap\", \"tock\", \"clap\"... You can produce simple musical patterns this way.\n\nDaily life use:  Leave it as it is.  It's fun to hear repeating sounds of ordinary life.  You can use the stereo headset with the mic.  Take a walk with the iPhone in your pocket and enjoy the repeating sounds around you.  \n\nIn detail: \"Echochops\" produces a feedback delay effect (an echo effect) on the sounds from the iPhone's microphone. The feedback delay is widely used to produce rich vocal and guitar sounds.  It is also used as a special kind of musical performance. You can use \"Echochops\" not only as a \"musical\" application  but also as a \"noisy\" experiment.\n\nFeatures:\n- Input and output level meter\n- Input and output level setting\n- Delay time setting, within 60 seconds.\n- Feedback rate setting, from 0% to 100%\n- Direct and Delay balance setting\n- Four types of audio filters (Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, Notch)\n- Audio filter frequency setting\n- Audio filer Q setting\n- Parameter control by audio input/output levels\n- Parameter control by tilting\n- Parameter control by rotating (a compass-equipped device only)\n- Mode setting to change delay time, \"Glitch\" or \"Funny\".\n- Output route setting, headphone/receiver or speaker.\n- Tilt angle setting for controlling\n- Upside-down portrait mode for efficient use of microphone and speaker\n- Delayed sound can be erased\n- Works with iPod audio simultaneously\n- Background audio playback (iOS 4.0 and later)\n\n[[ ATTENTIONS ]] Due to a latency of an audio input and output, the actual delaying time will be slightly longer than the setting.  A natural feedback through the air may happen because the microphone and speaker are placed closely on the iPhone.  Distorted sounds or harsh grating noises will be produced depending of the setting of parameters.  It would be better NOT to use this application if you cannot stand noisy sounds.\n\n[[ Address of Gratitude ]] Thanks to Mr. Kaoru Sato (EP-4)"

      "label": "The Minimoog Model D App is a software transmutation of the world’s first portable synthesizer, the Minimoog Model D®. Anyone can jump in and play with over 160 included presets or lay fingers to the controls and begin exploring vast magical realms of creative potential for iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and Mac. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App incorporates a number of inspiring sound creation tools and capabilities not present on its analog antecedent. New functions include the ability to play chords with up to four-note polyphony, an easy-to-use arpeggiator for rhythmic pattern creation, a real time looping recorder with unlimited overdubbing capacity, a tempo-synchronizable stereo ping pong delay module, and the Bender -- a wide-range stereo time modulation effect module. \n\nThe Minimoog Model D App also supports AUv3 Audio Unit extensions, which allows multiple instances of this powerful instrument to be used simultaneously within compatible iOS apps supporting AUv3.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY \nIntroduced by Moog in 1970, the Minimoog Model D served as the archetype for all electronic keyboards that followed. It gave users the ability to design their own sounds, translating imagination into reality. The Minimoog’s portability, affordability and accessibility made it the go-to instrument for musicians looking to expand beyond the traditional sounds of the time. Bernie Worrell used the Minimoog Model D to establish Parliament Funkadelic’s futuristic funk sound. Kraftwerk employed the Minimoog Model D on the successful concept album Autobahn, sparking an entirely new genre. Gary Numan replaced his live band’s guitars with Minimoog Model Ds, creating the prototype for industrial music. The classic sound of the Minimoog Model D can be heard on Bob Marley’s Catch A Fire, Michael Jackson’s Thriller and Dr. Dre’s The Chronic; Detailed in the mini-doc series “A Brief History Of The Minimoog”. \n\nFEATURES \n• Ships with over 160 presets (hundreds more available in the Minimoog Model D App Store) \n• Up to 4-notes of polyphony \n• Easily share presets and audio recordings with friends \n• Arpeggiator module with note-hold and chord latch capability \n• Stereo ping-pong delay effect \n• Bender time modulation effect \n• Real-time looping recorder with overdub and immediate sharing \n• Selectable envelope shapes and triggering behavior \n• Effortless MIDI CC mapping \n• Seamlessly backup presets to iCloud \n• Play mode for easier panel and keyboard interaction \n• A new take on the classic feedback/overload path \n\nSUPPORTS\n• All 64-bit iOS devices\n• AUv3 Audio Unit Extensions (Including GarageBand)\n• MPE Controller Support \n• Ableton Link \n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus\n• 7 and 14-Bit MIDI \n• MIDI Program Change Support \n• Bluetooth LE MIDI controllers \n• Share over AirDrop, Mail, or other iOS applications"

      "label": "XAir Monitor Mixer is a personal monitor mixer for select Behringer and Midas digital mixers. It allows each musician on stage to choose exactly what they hear in their monitor without affecting (or being able to affect, even by accident) the band's main mix.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer supports the Behringer X18, XR18, XR16, XR12, and the Midas MR18 and MR12.\n\nXAir Monitor Mixer deliberately does not include controls that would allow a musician on stage to accidentally mute channels or otherwise alter the main mix.\n\nUsage:\n\n1. Connect to the same WiFi network as the XR18.  In most cases, this should be enough for the app to find your mixer. However, if your sound engineer has changed the default address of the mixer, you'll have to enter that address in the app's connection screen.\n2. Choose which monitor you want to mix. If your sound engineer hasn't named these in a way that makes it obvious which is yours, ask him which is yours.\n3.

You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.  It would mean a lot to us if you could leave your positive review on the App Store and If you have any questions about GeoShred we would love to hear from you at our support email address: support@moforte.com \n\n---\nMinimum Requirements:  iOS 11.4 or better is required for AUv3 support and GeoSWAM instruments.\n*Note: The GeoSWAM instruments can ONLY be performed from the GeoShred keyboard or MPE controllers.\n**Note: Unfortunately, due to App Store limitations, previously purchased instrument IAPs can not be applied to a purchase of the collection IAP. \n***Note: The Pro upgrade is to the functionality of GeoShred Pro.

Only now we have full polyphony, a build in arpeggiator, an a host of integrated effects. It features such as the ability to design custom waveforms, oscillator sync and various cross modulation modes. Cross modulation is a type of FM synthesis which can be used to morph simplistic waveforms into something far more aggressive and interesting.\n\nAt the heart of Copperhead are its two oscillators, which support all your traditional waveforms (SINE,SQR,SAW,TRI), as well as SuperSaw, Trapezium, and a user definable type. The app features pulse wave modulation for multiple sources, and the ability to sync oscillators.\n\nThe Voltage Controller Filter supports the usual LP, HP, BP and Notch filters, as well as a couple of unusual ones like Formant which allows you to sweep your cutoff to create interesting vowel sounds.\n\nCopperhead also features twin LFO's with random and one shot functionality. It also supports Cross, Ring and FM modulators, in addition to low and high shelf filters.\n\nOne of the great features is the integrated audio gate, which allows you to generate stuttering audio right out of the box. Combined with effects such as Chorus, Overdrive, Delay, Reverb and Auto Pan / Tremelo, and the ability to specify effect order, you have a lot of control over your sound.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, we also include a 32 step sequencer, with various mono and poly modes with direct control control of various synth elements.\n\nWe have a built in Preset Manager which groups presets into banks and groups, which supports drag and drop for easy import/export of presets. You can also access your favourites from a special popup menu, or via the built in quick search facility.\n\n○ AUv3 compatible.\n○ Up to 16 note polyphony.\n○ 7 Oscillator wave types.\n○ Sub Oscillator.\n○ PW/PWM on SQR and TRP waveforms.\n○ Supports SuperSaw with MIX and DETUNE.\n○ XMod / Ring and FM modulations.\n○ Osc Sync.\n○ 6 types of VCF filter.\n○ Low and High shelf on output.\n○ Built in compressor.\n○ Chorus, Delay, Overdrive, Reverb and Auto Pan effects.\n○ Built in Audio Gate.\n○ Preset Manager with Bank/Group/Preset section.\n○ Supports drag and drop to import/export presets, groups and banks.\n○ Supports web transfer of presets.\n○ 32 step arpeggiator.\n \nNOTE: This is an AUv3 plugin which was designed to be hosted in DAW's such as AUM, Cubasis, GarageBand, Loopy Pro etc."

Simply put, AeroPads won't step on the toes of your arrangement or get on the nerves of your sound guy (like most other pads out there).\n\n\nHighlighted Features:\n- A beautiful space-inspired interface with a simple and intuitive design.\n- Live View: Every key and three of your favorite patches are instantly accessible (best suited for experimentation, free-flowing sets, and songwriting).\n- Setlist View: Plan and build a detailed setlist (best suited for structured sets and seamless transitions).\n- The iconic Atmosphere Soundpack which includes five unique patches named after and inspired by the layers of Earth's atmosphere. \n- Three patches can be added to Live View to be made instantly accessible, so there's no need to dig through menus to just to change a patch when performing live.\n- Additional patches and soundpacks available for purchase.\n\n\nHow to Use:\n01. Cue a pad that matches the key of your musical arrangement.\n02. Play overtop of the accompanying pads and soundcapes.\n03. Enjoy the boost of audience engagement, musician confidence, and creative inspiration.\n\nPads and soundscapes are intended as a subtle accompaniment to musical arrangements/performances. They are designed to be cued according to the key of the arrangement. Once cued, you'll hear a droning pad centered around the root note with additional harmonic textures within the major scale. Pads can accompany arrangements of both minor and major scales. To accompany an arrangement within a minor scale, cue the relative major (Example: to accompany an arrangement in the key of A minor, cue \"C\"). A pad's key should not be changed to match chord changes within an arrangement. The only time a pad's key should change within a song is in the instance of a key change. For best results, mix AeroPads appropriately within the overall mix. When mixed too loud, AeroPads may compete with melodies and the arrangement. When mixed too quietly, AeroPads may be less effective. When mixed appropriately, they will sound awesome."

      "label": "This Audio Unit, a filter, part of our JAF Series, is specialized for continuously fading the processed audio signal seamlessly between lowpass and highpass in performance situations. The center position of the cutoff will pass thru the unfiltered sound. A tube like saturation effect can be applied too.\n\nThe particular feature of fading between low and high\nfrequency is often asked by DJs for their special purposes, but only few products actually will offer such essential feature directly or even at all. Building own  filter setups with 2 filters usually can be problematic for allot of possible reasons.\n\nOur unit comes with 12 different selectable none-linear filter characteristics that are well known from our flagship product, the “JAF Collection”. These filters are modelled after ancient hardware filters from the golden age of analog synthesizer technology and will deliver unreached authenticity with all the quirks. They were initially thought for freshing up digital audio material and creative usage.\n\nThe filters all support fine-tuned “peak” and “drive” parameters and therefore will have a great amount of sonic variability. The drive will add tube like saturation to the filter models but also will touch the internal filter characteristics. Most of the models have high resonance and in fact can act as tone generators due to their ability of self oscillation.\n\n\fWe overworked each single filter model carefully for supporting the analog style continuous fading between lowpass and highpass, which is technically difficult to solve. Special attention was applied to the center position, which usually should pass the audio signal untouched for keeping it free of fading artefacts and possible other negative side effects while sweeping the cutoff and turning back to the allpass.\n\n\nOur filters are real stereo processing filter units and can produce quite extreme values. They have unmatched sonic qualities, usually not found with common digital filters. This behaviour is intended.\n\nWe hope, that we can close the gap for all DJ enthusiasts with this release now, giving them a filter plugin, that is easy to use and specialised for applying interesting sounding frequency sweeps to their mixes.\n\nJAF DEEJAY is available exclusively on the Apple  iOS platforms and will not be released on any other systems."

For example the character 'g' represents a Claves sound.\nThe length of the sound is given as fraction of the beat. \nExamples: \n1.   \"g\"  means, sound g is repeatedly played with the tempo given by the beats per minute setting. g1 is identical to g. The one can be omitted.  \n2. \"a b b b\"  ... is a rhythm of 4 notes with two sounds 'a' for AgogoHigh and 'b' for AgogoLow. The  sounds are running in a loop. \n3. \"a b z\"  ... rhythm of 3 notes. 'z' denotes a pause, \n4. \"d/2 d/2 c3/2 d/2\"  ...  pattern with fractions of beats;  first two notes have a half  beat duration; then a note with one and a half beat duration follows; then a note with a half beat duration again.  \n5. \"h/3\" in the first line and \"j/4\" in the second line results in high and low bongo notes playing four against three. In similar manner complex polyrhythms can be set.  The lines are looping even if they have different durations.\n\nAn extra keyboard allows efficient editing of rhythms. The drum sound inventory of 43 sounds can be inspected from the keyboard by typing the  '~'. \n\nIn addition to the three drum sound tracks, a light metronome can be programmed in similar manner. The lights are set with the letters w, r, g, b, y, m, c and d, meaning the colors white, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan and dark (black). \nExample:  b2 d2  ...  two beats blue, two beats black.\n\nFurther a surface with configurable drum pads supports drumming interaction and memorizing the drum sound letters. The pads can be added from the drum sound inventory by pressing '+', reordered by long pressing the pad and dragging and dropping, and removed with '-' if needed.\n\nBeside a  slider for adjusting the overall loudness, the individual drum sound loudness\ncan be set by adding a plus or minus sign followed by a number in the range from -9 to 9.  For example 'd/2-4' would reduce the sound level for 4 dB. \n\nThe Store allows to select a rhythm from the repository. Around 20 preset rhythms are provided. Self created rhythms can be named, added to the list and saved for later use.\n\nHelp information is provided at a fingertip."

Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you."

      "label": "Undulator is Eventide’s classic modulated tremolo effect from the iconic H3000 effects processor. This unique, rhythmic effect combines ethereal feedback and detuned echos, run through an AM / FM modulated tremolo. Whether used for manipulating samples or adding movement to strings, pads, guitars, and keys, Undulator is a muse for creative musicians. Add Undulator into your plug-ins collection for the most playable tremolo-style effect on your DAW or iOS device.\n\nUndulator excels at evolving pads, sync’d chops, and time-lapsing dreamy soundscapes. Combined with a multi-tap delay and powerful tremolo, Undulator’s controls give any sound sustain and shape. This is perfect for transforming ordinary synths, keys, guitars, and even vocals into evolving pads, tempo synced production elements, or ethereal and fluctuant delays. Simply put, Undulator can make shorter sounds into longer layered effects, and give sustaining sounds shape and rhythmic character.\n\nUse the Ribbon to morph tremolo patterns into vacillating and varying rhythmic territories. This can be effective for calling attention to synth pads and creating a state of flux or rarity which is otherwise arduous to achieve.\n\n- Turn up the MIX to increase the dry/effect ratio\n- Utilize multiple modulation waveform shapes and sources to alter the rhythmic feel\n- Subtly finesse detuning of delays by using SPREAD\n- Add FEEDBACK to accentuate delays or create infinite loops\n- The Secondary LFO determines how fast the depth and speed modulation “wiggle” their targets\n- Lock the tremolo to tempo using SYNC\n- RETRIG at the top of the waveform for a more predictable effect\n- RIBBON lets you ‘play’ the effect in real-time and provides dynamic and fluid control to morph back and forth between the settings of your choice\n- SLOW/FAST button toggles on a “Slow LFO” mode. Holding it down to “BRAKE” temporarily slows down the LFOs at a constant rate until released\n- Update the tremolo speed in real time using the TAP button\n- Available as an AUv3 plug-in and Standalone App"

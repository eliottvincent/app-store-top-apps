Realms is a monthly subscription service that lets you create your own always-online Minecraft world.\nThere are currently two subscription options to choose from depending on how many people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously. A realm for you and 2 friends costs 3.99 USD/month (or local equivalent) and a realm for you and 10 friends cost 7.99 USD/month (or local equivalent).\nA 30-day trial of Minecraft Realms for you and 10 friends is available. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.\n\nThe payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and the subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that take you to these settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you won't be refunded for the remaining active period of the subscription.\n\nHere are links to our privacy policy and terms of use:\n- Privacy policy: https://account.mojang.com/terms#privacy\n- Terms of use: https://account.mojang.com/terms"

What do triangles, octagons or squares sound like? Each world starts with small tutorial stages and ends with a final test.\n\n- Post-game challenges: Speed Trials for each world and a blisteringly fast bonus level for the brave.\n\n- Calibration options: auto-calibration and manual calibration. This is a precise rhythm game, so use your ears more than your eyes when playing.\n\n- Play new levels for free: more levels will be added over the coming months.\n\nWARNING: This is a hard rhythm game. Not in the sense of note-spamming - for the most part all you have to do is keep a consistent beat - but this is a good test of whether you would be a good drummer. Keeping a beat is not very easy, and then weird breakbeats are added on top of that, so don't worry if you find it difficult!"

You face a challenge: go through a trial period of seven weeks to get a permanent job and advance the interests of your employer.\n\nFeatures.\nYou need to examine each client's feature to determine his, her, or its fate. There are more features every day and the game becomes more difficult. Your client holds a pistol? Send him to Hell unless he changes his mind and drops weapons. Is your client a hat-lover? Should you send him to Heaven? No, it's not that easy! First, take the hat off, and you might see the horns. Being a demon, killer, or an angel are features, too. \n\nCatastrophes.\nThese are unique events, they're unexpected and rapid, so Reaper is pressed by time. But you must allocate clients correctly to complete a catastrophe, unlock new clients and increase Death's influence! Unlucky pirates, bear influenza epidemic in Siberia, fighting for a free soup - these are only some of the catastrophes.\n\nEvents.\nEach week you will face a new event. The more days you worked, the more events you have. Trainees' phone calls, safes with smuggled goods, undercover agents of Paradox, kidnappers. They all pose some difficulties but help you to become the best in the biz. Why, you can even cook a soup!\n\nTheme Days.\nEach seventh day is a theme day. You'll choose clients' fate for a unique soundtrack corresponding to the spirit of the chosen theme. Egypt? Certainly! Mother Russia? Nostrovia! Pirate day? Yo-ho-ho!\n\nWhat else?\nHorsemen tasks, funny clients' phrases, lots of references and easter eggs, bonuses, penalties, very special clients - all this will define your future as the Reaper determine the game ending!\n\nGood luck, Reaper!"

It is also very hard, and I love it for that.” ***\n84/100 – PC Gamer\n \n***”It evokes lot of the more demanding thrills that modern games have left behind, the grit and the hard won satisfaction of overcoming intimidating challenges, or the experimental fun of spending hours tinkering with all the different ways you can play through a big, open-ended level. I had a blast inching my way through pretty much all of the harder stages in this game and I also think you might have a blast with it too.” ***\nSuper Bunnyhop\n \n“It’s a thing of beauty and manages to capture the planning and satisfying execution of more complex strategy games, as well as the gung-ho and the popping-off of growly man in military shooters. (...) It’s probably the best man-shootery game I’ve played in years.”\nIndie Statik\n \nDoor Kickers mixes old school, no-quarter action with modern ergonomic interfaces and puts you in command of a SWAT team during a tactical intervention.\n \nAnalyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.\n \nIt may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps and losing no people, that’s a skill harder to master.\nQuick Points:\n§ 80 single missions, 6 campaigns and unlimited gameplay via mission generator\n§ Over 65 weapons and gear items to use and overcome the enemy.\n§ Top Down perspective  for optimal tactical analysis\n§ Real Time With Free Pause\n§ No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces\n§ Realistic but action packed\n§ Non-linear levels, freeform gameplay\n\nWebsite https://inthekillhouse.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/KillHouseGames\nTwitter - @inthekillhouse"

      "label": "Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler RPG that's simple to get into but hard to master! Every game is a unique challenge, with four different heroes, randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and use. ShatteredPD is also updated once every two or three months, so there's always something new.\n\n◀ Choose Your Hero ▶\nEach of ShatteredPD's four playable heroes has their own unique mechanics and gameplay style. Smash some heads as the durable Warrior, fry your enemies as the arcane Mage, or use terrain to your advantage as the stealthy Rogue or the markswoman Huntress!\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll earn points to spend on talents, choose a subclass, and gain powerful lategame abilities. You can turn the Warrior into a combo-building Gladiator, the Mage into a soul-sucking Warlock, the Huntress into a tanky Warden, or explore loads of other possibilities!\n\n◀ Explore the Dungeon ▶\nShatteredPD's dungeon is procedurally generated with random layouts, room types, items, traps, and enemies. In each game you'll find equipment and collect or craft consumable items to power you up or help you out in a pinch. There is a huge variety to what you might see from run to run and region to region.\n\nAs you progress through the dungeon you'll find equipment that can be enchanted, upgraded, and augmented as you outfit your hero. Set foes ablaze with an enchanted weapon, wade through enemies with upgraded armor, or gain powerful damage, defensive, or utility benefits from one of the many wands, rings, or magical artifacts.\n\n◀ Succeed or Die Trying ▶\nThe Dungeon is filled with enemies, traps, hazards, and bosses intent on ending your run! Battle hostile wildlife in the sewers and caves, mad thieves and guards in the prison, occult servants in the fallen dwarven city, and maybe something even worse further down...\n\nAll these hazards can make the game quite tough, but don't be discouraged! You probably won't win on your first try, but there are many tricks and strategies to discover and learn on the path to getting your first win!\n\n◀ Almost A Decade in the Making ▶\nShattered Pixel Dungeon is an open source game based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon by Watabou (first released in 2013). It started in 2014 as a project to rebalance Pixel Dungeon but has steadily grown into its own game over the last 8 years!\n\nFeatures Include:\n• 4 Heroes, each with 2 subclasses, 3 endgame abilities, and over 25 talents.\n• Over 250 items including equipment, consumables, and items crafted via alchemy.\n• 5 dungeon regions, 26 floors, over 100 room types, and trillions of possible floor layouts.\n• Over 60 enemy types, 30 traps, and 5 detailed bosses to test your skills.\n• 9 optional challenges and over 100 achievements for completionists.\n• Interface modes for large and small screens, and support for multiple input types.\n• Updates every 2-3 months with new content, fixes, and improvements.\n• Support for many languages thanks to the game's dedicated communities."

Thus, the operation is only done to people on their deathbeds, to fulfill what they wish they had done with their lives, but didn’t.\n\nThis particular story follows their attempt to fulfill the dream of an elderly man, Johnny. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny's past is revealed. As the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is.\n\nAnd Johnny's last wish is, of course... to go to the moon.\n\nMORE DETAILS\n\"To the Moon\", a story-driven RPG with pixel graphics, was originally developed six years ago for PC by Canadian producer Kan Gao and Freebird Games, his indie game studio.Rights to develop and publish the remastered mobile version of \"To the Moon\" were acquired by X.D.

Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with every passing moment. As you rise to take your father’s place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no mistake – this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival. \n\nBad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red.\n\nIt’s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.\nKeep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North.\n\nKey Features\n\nREAL-TIME TACTICS ROGUELITE:  Position and relocate your troops to fend off the Vikings, who each have their own counters to the threats you pose. Pick your battles and plan your evacuations carefully! Lose a commander and they’re gone forever; lose everything, and it’s game over! \n\nINTELLIGENT UNIT CONTROLS: You command the broad strokes of your defenses and monitor positioning — your soldiers do the rest, navigating and engaging intuitively in response to the situation at hand.\n\nPROCEDURALLY-GENERATED ISLANDS: Each island is both stylistically charming and unique in its layout. Plan your strategies around every nook and cranny, for you only get one chance to save them from the enemy invasion.\n\nUNLOCKABLE UPGRADES: A stronger, smarter defense leads to greater rewards. Use these to develop your subjects from a ragtag militia into seasoned warriors."

      "label": "이 게임은 전혀 대중적이지 않은, 진입장벽이 매우 높은 게임입니다. 아래 게임 설명을 잘 읽어보시고 본인의 취향에 어느 정도 들어 맞는다고 생각되시는 분들만 플레이 부탁드립니다.\n\n네이버 공식카페\nhttps://cafe.naver.com/centurybaseball\n\n카카오 오픈톡방\nhttps://open.kakao.com/o/gUMU0zXd\n\n\n■ 추천 대상 ■\n\n1. 기존에 없던 형태의 참신하고 매니악한 야구 시뮬레이션을 원하시는 분\n\n2. 기존 야구 게임들의 과장된 데이터, 성장하기만 하는 선수, 비현실적인 기록에 흥미를 느끼지 못하시는 분\n\n3. 순발력을 요구하는 조작, 골치아픈 로스터 조정 보다는 여유롭게 데이터를 읽는 것을 즐기시는 분\n\n4. 백년이 넘는 오랜 세월의 리그 시뮬레이션을 느긋하고 여유롭게 음미하고 싶으신 분\n\n\n■ 게임 특징 ■\n\n1. 가상 리그는 현 한국 프로야구의 시스템을 바탕으로 설계되었습니다.\n\n2. 이 게임의 플레이어는 선수도, 감독도 아닌 단장의 역할을 합니다.\n\n3. 플레이어가 선임한 AI감독이 선발 로스터를 알아서 관리하는 등 대부분 자동으로 시뮬레이션 됩니다.\n\n4. 플레이어는 매년 신인드래프트, FA계약, 선수 트레이드, 용병 영입/방출, 감독 선임/해촉을 직접 결정하여 구단의 장기적인 전력에 핵심적인 영향을 끼칩니다.\n\n5. 선수의 능력치 성장은 기본적으로 현실과 같이 플레이어의 뜻대로 성장 시킬 수 없지만, 선임한 감독의 능력에 따라 다소간의 영향은 받습니다.\n\n6. 게임을 어느 정도 진행하시면 명예의 전당, 타팀으로부터의 단장 스카웃 제의, 100년 후 환생 등의 히든 컨텐츠를 만나보실 수 있습니다.\n\n\n■ 기타 ■\n\n1.  이 게임의 목표는 유저의 플레이 성향에 따라 다양합니다. 매년 우승하는 왕조의 건설이 목표일 수도 있고, 명예의 전당이나 영구결번 선수를 많이 만들어 내는 것이 목표일 수도 있습니다. 또는 현실과 비슷한 밸런스의 시뮬레이션을 목표로 운영해 나갈 수도 있습니다. 정답은 없습니다.\n\n2. 인앱구매 요소들이 있지만 다분히 취향적인 선택입니다. 본인이 현실에 가까운 세계관을 원하시면 오히려 인앱구매를 하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 인앱구매를 많이 할 수록 현실성이 깨질 수 있다는 점을 명심하셔야 합니다.\n\n3. 선발오더나 작전 등 현장의 운영에 깊게 개입하길 원하시는 분, 년단위의 빠른 시뮬레이션 진행을 원하시는 분들은 이 게임과 맞지 않을 수 있으니 신중히 접근하시기 바랍니다."

And so he sets out on a grand adventure to learn the truth of his world, and that of the mysterious phantom realm that lies beneath...\n\nThis world-spanning saga can now be enjoyed in the palm of your hand!\n\n◆Game Features\n・Join forces with a band of individual adventurers!\nAmass a following of faithful friends as you travel around the riven realms. From wandering warriors to amnesiac teens, a rich cast of characters will join you in your adventures, and help you to unlock the mysteries of your clouded world!\n\n・Vocational Education\nAs you progress in the game, the hero and his party will gain access to Alltrades Abbey, where they can specialise in any of over sixteen vocations. Train your skills in your chosen vocation, and learn a multitude of spells and special abilities. After you have mastered an ability, you can still use it even if you change vocation!\n\n・Converse Freely with your Fellow Party Members!\nThe party chat function allows you to converse freely with the cast of colourful characters who will accompany you on your adventure. So don’t hesitate to turn to them for advice and idle chit-chat whenever the urge assails you! \n\n・360-Degree Views\nRotate your viewpoint in towns and villages through a full 360 degrees to make sure you don’t miss a thing! \n\n・AI Battles \nTired of giving orders?

If lady luck smiles on you, you might be rewarded with the rarest items of all!\n\n・The Slimopolis\nUnlike previous titles, where monsters could only be recruited during battle, Dragon Quest VI lets you recruit an army of lovely little slimes as you travel around the world! Once you’ve recruited a slimy friend or two, head to the Slimopolis to test their mettle in a series of arena battles, with fabulous prizes on offer for any slime tough enough to emerge victorious! Train up your slimes, and aim for the championship!\n\n・Slippin’ Slime\nThe slime-sliding minigame introduced in the Nintendo DS version makes its welcome return!

This is a moderated version of the magazine, and please note the H&E app is entirely separate to our digital edition available via browser.\n\nEvery month H&E naturist is packed with a host of features on practically every aspect of the naturist lifestyle around the world. Every issue carries an updated UK & Ireland club and swim guide and What's On listings, plus regular columns on France, Spain and Portugal, nude-related film and book reviews, and a Q&A column which aims to answer readers' questions about naturism, whether they be common or more unusual inquiries. \n\nThere is also a regular food column with the young Manchester-based Naked Vegan Cooks, who you might have seen on TV in C4's widely trailed My Daughter, the Teenage Nudist. \n\nThroughout the year, special features offer a closer look at a wider range of destinations, from the USA & Caribbean and Greece, to what the UK has to offer with updates from home grown naturist clubs and attractions. \n\nIf you’re interested in the naturist lifestyle, where to meet like-minded people and how to get involved then H&E is essential reading.\n\nNote: This app is a moderated version of H&E Naturist Magazine, as full nudity is not allowed on this platform.\n\nSingle issues are available to purchase at £3.99 and you can take out an annual subscription at £28.99 a year. \n\nSubscription-related details:\n\n-The subscription will include the current issue if you do not already own it, and subsequently-published future issues. \n\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n\n- You may turn off auto-renewing subscriptions by going to your user’s Account Settings after purchase.

Within the application you can purchase access to the complete issue and an archive of back issues extending to August 2006. Issues are not sold individually - for the duration of your subscription you have access to every issue in this archive.\n\nDuring your subscription you can sync back issues to your device. These will remain in place if your subscription expires, unless your device removes them (for example when running low on disk space). Re-downloading issues requires a current subscription.\n\n• Swipe or tap the page edges to flip to next/previous page. \n• Use the animated thumbnail view to flick through the pages. \n• Pinch or double-tap pages to zoom. \n• Switch between single or double-page view. \n• Search the current issue or the archive. \n• Tap any page links to web sites, email addresses, phone numbers or maps. \n• Tap contents-page links to jump to a particular article. \n• Sync the latest issue to your device for offline reading (requires wi-fi). \n• Sync additional back issues by tapping the stars beside their names (requires wi-fi). \n• Network connection required otherwise. \n\nWe recommend first running the app within a wi-fi area so it can sync the latest issue to your device - after that you can use it anywhere.

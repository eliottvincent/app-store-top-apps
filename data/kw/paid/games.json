Collect the photos from obscure corners and angles to reveal the underlying story, one photo at a time.\r\n\r\n【Get Unstuck with Thoughtful Hints】\r\nThere is a multitude of guidance systems to help prevent players from getting stuck. Focus can be activated to highlight the key items to the solution, while hint texts are available to provide further clarity. And, if all else fails, video walkthroughs can be unlocked as the ultimate safety plan. \r\n\r\n【Prove Your Puzzle-Solving Skills with Medals】\r\nThere are a total of 15 achievements in the game, each corresponding with a Medal that has been crafted with a uniquely stunning design. A complete collection of the 15 Medals could be the perfect evidence to attest to your master puzzle-solving skills~\r\n\r\n【Connect with us:】\r\nTwitter: @MoncageTheGame\r\nEmail: moncagethegame@gmail.com\r\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/TEVX2uPEsj"

You may also play partnership games, (aka likha) and tear apart the other team.\n\nThere's no pleasantries in Sibeeta such as breaking hearts, starting with 2 of clubs, or shooting the moon.  Your focus is to completely obliterate your opponents even if they take every point in the deck.\n\n- Online multiplayer support!\n\n- If you're new to the game, there's a \"How to Play\" that should get you started out.\n\n- Not your standard Hearts bots, trust me.\n\n- Partnership games.\n\n- Option to add jokers as wildcards.

The game departs its familiar desert setting and delves into the depths of cities infested by zombies. \n\nMULTI-TIERED LEVELS:\nLevels are now multi-tiered! Drive across decayed highway overpasses, via underground tunnels, or smash through epic zombie filled factories. Whichever path you choose to take, you won't be able to escape the zombie hordes - your only choice is to smash through them!\n\nBUILD A ZOMBIE-SLAUGHTERING MACHINE\nUnlock and upgrade 10 different vehicles, including a sports car, a fire truck, and even an ice-cream van. Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.\n\nDESTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES\nVehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.\n\nMORE ZOMBIES. MORE DESTRUCTION. MORE MAYHEM.\nWhat are you waiting for? That rescue ship isn't going to wait forever! Prepare yourself for a wild ride - and seriously, there is nothing like smashing through zombie-filled factories!"

      "label": "WINNER OF A PARENTS' CHOICE GOLD AWARD\r\n\r\nWINNER OF AN EDITOR'S CHOICE AWARD from Childrens Technology Review\r\n\r\nRATED 4 STARS AND A+ BY COMMON SENSE MEDIA\r\n\r\nSavings Spree is a fun App with a serious lesson for children ages 7 and up (younger children can play too with a little help from mom and dad or an older sibling). It teaches kids how the choices they make each day can add up to big savings or big expenses, depending on how they decide to spend (or not spend) their money. Savings Spree shows kids that they can SAVE their money for short term goals (like a bike or an MP3 player),  SPEND wisely by making more frugal decisions, DONATE to others or INVEST money so it will grow to meet future needs like a college education.\r\nThe game also teaches kids how the daily lifestyle choices that they make can add up to big savings or big expenses, depending on how they choose to spend (or not spend) their money. \r\n\r\nThe game introduces the concept of earning money for the work that's available and also guides the child through making choices with the money accumulated during the game. Lastly, the game demonstrates that events beyond one's control can cost money, so it's good a good idea to have a rainy day fund available to pay for unexpected events.\r\n\r\nThe game is presented in game show format, taking players through six rounds that test their financial knowledge and help them build money saving skills. The host of the show is the Money Savvy Pig, the trusted, money-smart character central to the award-winning Money Savvy Kids curriculum, also available from Money Savvy Generation."

In five different game modes you'll have to learn to handle a shotgun like an expert and hit rapidly flying targets from varying angles! Including Arcade Challenge featuring upgrades, power-ups and unlimited gameplay.\n\nSkeet and trap shooting enthusiast all around the world praise Clay Hunt for it's realistic physics and authenticity:\n\n\"I shoot trap on a regular basis and have been looking for a realistic clay shooting game. Look no further,this is it.\"\n\n\"Best Shooting Game App Period” \n\n\"Love this game - bought it thinking it might be fun but it's far more than that - brilliant fun - always trying to beat my previous best. Play with headphones and the shotgun sound is so accurate - just like the real thing. RECOMMENDED\"\n\n\"Excellent !!!! Le top !!!!!\"\n\n\"Shoot clays at the weekend have been shooting about three months with some coaching. Some targets I can hit no problem, others I just cant hit. I was looking for a clay simulator to try and analyse my mistakes. I was sure my problem was reading the targets and my searching bought me to this game.\nFirst thing I noticed was the target presentations were all familiar to me and the ones I can shoot in the real world I can shoot in the game. Targets I cant hit for real I cant hit in the game either. So I played it for four says straight learning where to place the shot for various targets at various stages of flight. Off to the range today I shot my best round ever, and I mean massive difference. Missed some fast crossers then hit them by increasing the lead a little. It has helped me build up target pictures in my head so I take them more instinctively. \nThanks for a truly useful app. I was going to spring for another lesson out of desperation, another £75 but Im going to stick with this for a while\"\n\nFeatures:\n• Real life physics for clay bird trajectories and leads\n• Unique multi-touch controls\n• Authentic graphics and sound effects\n• Tutorial mode, where you can practice your shotgun handling\n• Three classic clay pigeon shooting modes (similar to skeet shooting or trap shooting)\n• Arcade challenge with weapon upgrades, power-ups and endless challenge\n• Three shotguns: double barrel and two semi-automatics\n• Game Center Leaderboards and Achievements\n----------\n\nSee also the new Clay Hunt PRO - Advanced Shotgun Shooting Simulator\n\nIf you encounter any problems please send e-mail. You can also try to restart the device and make sure you have the latest software version of the game and your device."

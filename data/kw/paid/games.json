Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.

      "label": "Kingdom Two Crowns is a side-scrolling micro strategy game with a minimalist feel wrapped in a beautiful, modern pixel art aesthetic. Play the role of a monarch atop their steed and recruit loyal subjects, build your kingdom and protect it from the greedy creatures looking to steal your coins and crown. \r\n\r\nIn the brand-new campaign mode, monarchs must now work to build a kingdom that stands over time until finding a way to defeat the Greed for good. Explore the environments to discover new mounts and secrets hidden in the deep. \r\n\r\nBut you don’t have to rule alone! Introducing cooperative play to Kingdom Two Crowns, monarchs can now choose between a solo experience or seek the assistance of a friend, working together locally in classic split screen while sitting next to your fellow monarch, or even across from them on opposite sides of the device in the custom mobile feature of tabletop coop.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the traditional medieval setting, Kingdom Two Crowns also includes: \r\n\r\n• Dead Lands: Enter the dark lands of Kingdom. Play as unique monarchs, including the Shardbinder Miriam, with powerful traits from the gothic horror action-RPG Bloodstained. Ride the gigantic beetle steed to lay out traps, the eerie undead mount that summons barriers impeding the progress of the Greed, and from Bloodstained the mythic demon horse “Gamigin” with its powerful charge attack. Building your Kingdom has never been spookier!\r\n\r\n• Shogun: Journey to lands inspired by the architecture and culture of feudal Japan. Play as the mighty Shogun or Onna-bugeisha, enlist the support of the ninja, lead your soldiers to battle atop the mythological Kirin, and form new strategies as you brave the Greed hiding in the thick bamboo forests.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to keep the feeling of exploration, discovery, and strategy alive in Kingdom Two Crowns in post-release updates with more themed settings, each with unique styles that marvel the eye while changing how you rule the lands.\r\n\r\nA challenge awaits all who seek it here, whether you are a first-time ruler or a long-time fan. So be brave, great monarchs, for in the end Two Crowns shall reign stronger than one!"

Unleash the mystical Sword of Ditto for an unforgettable adventure filled with delightful characters, extraordinary loot, and heroic battles!\n\nUnique Adventures Linked Together: Each adventure becomes its own legend, both distinct from those that came before it and part of a heroic legacy that bind together. The deeds, successes, and failures of each hero's adventure have implications for those that follow including the ability to find weapons and recover loot from history’s fallen heroes.\n\nWeapons, Items, & Stickers: Wield the traditional sword and bow combo alongside the decidedly less traditional vinyl record Frisbee, magic golf club, and colossal foot from the heavens to put Mormo and her legions back on their heels. Collect and equip stickers to boost up your hero and add perks to their gear to become powerful enough to banish the wicked sorceress. \n\nMain Quests and Secret Side Missions: Approach your legend however you see fit by battling through dungeons in any order, completing side missions through dark caverns and deep wells, or confront Mormo right from the start for the ultimate challenge."

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

While the original got rave reviews for its stylized manga graphics and quick, bloody gameplay, Samurai II delivers even more action and an intuitive new control scheme.\n\nSlideToPlay.com - 4/4\nIpadarena.com - 10/10\nAppSpy.com - 5/5\nMacWorld.com - 4.5/5\nAppAdvice.com - 4.5/5\nGamezebo.com - 4.5/5\nTouchreviews.net - 4.5/5\nNineoverten.com - 4.5/5\nifanzine 4.5/5\nGamerstemple.com - 90/100\nPixeljumpers.com - 9/10\nPocketGamer.co.uk 8/10 \n\n\nSamurai: Way of the Warrior was featured in Best Games of 2009 by Apple – Samurai II is a true successor, aided by over a year of focused development. Overall production values and vicious action put Samurai II on par with console 3D brawlers. Screenshots don’t do Samurai II justice – the fluid action has to be seen running at 60 frames per second on the Retina display or popping off the iPad screen.\n\nBut looks alone won’t carry a game – the developers listened to fan feedback and improved gameplay throughout. With a new virtual d-pad, dynamic camera, environmental puzzles, traps, and vicious new enemies, Samurai II is brand new experience for hack ‘n’ slash gamers on the go. \n\nSamurai II sends Daisuke on a quest for revenge across the war-scorched countryside. From a seafaring village to a flying fortress to the legendary Isle of the Dead, the samurai will stop at nothing to hunt down his arch-enemy Orochi. Will he get his Vengeance?\n\nFEATURES:\n* Intuitive virtual joystick ensures you’re slicing up baddies, not swiping the screen.\n\n* Dynamic camera finds the best perspective for each encounter, adding variety while keeping focused on the action.\n\n* Tense, quick and gory battle sequences!\n- Battle hordes of on-screen enemies wielding new weapons and sporting unique abilities.\n- Stay nimble and plan your attacks – roll out of harm’s way and eliminate ranged enemies like the Samurai Archer before they can strike.\n* Improved gameplay includes new features.\n-   Solve environmental puzzles, avoid dangerous traps, and discover useful items.\n- The fight is on - not to worry, the combat never takes a back seat to platforming or fetch-quests.\n\n* RPG elements reward skilled players – upgrade the Samurai’s health, buy new attack combos and upgrade them to devastating levels.\n\n* Between levels, gorgeous anime-style comic panels tell the samurai’s tale with original hand-drawn artwork.\n\n* New survival mode pits the samurai against waves of enemies, giving hardcore players a score-attack mode to hone their skills. Two games in one!\n\n* Advanced AI system on par with console games. Goal Oriented Action Planning architecture is used in many PC and console games.\n\n* Apple Game Center support, including Leaderboards and Achievements. \n\n*Support iCloud to transfer save between various devices\n\n*Support MFI Controllers (Gamepads)\n\n* Original soundtrack – in classic samurai movie style, soft music builds with the heat of battle.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks To : ImNoSuperMan, PureSkill, Squarezero, Rocco, eggzbacon, Prab"

He suddenly loses consciousness and comes to in what appears to be the interior of the academy.\nThe dreary mood is far from the impression given by the name \"Hope's Peak Academy.\" The dingy corridors, iron-barred windows, and prison-like atmosphere... Something is wrong.\n\nIn the entrance hall, a stuffed bear that claims to be the headmaster tells the students they will live in the confines of the school until the day they die, and they must kill someone if they want to leave.\n\nIncluding Makoto, there are 15 Ultimate Students from all over the world trapped in this academy of despair.\nOne thing after another crushes their hope. Incidents which shake their trust, the sadistic headmaster, and the mystery of the mastermind. Who is behind it all, and what do they want?\n\nThe battle with an unseen enemy begins...\n\n\n■ Game Features\n\n・High Speed Deductive Action\nDetermine the truth of each incident with testimony and proof gathered during your investigation. Use what you've learned in high-speed Class Trials to shoot down the opponent's statements.\n\n・2.5D Motion Graphics\nA distinctly crafted environment that's planar yet stereoscopic is born by combining 2D illustrations of characters and objects in a 3D environment.\nThese new, 2.5D motion graphics were developed by using unique motion techniques and camera work.\n\n・Completely Optimized for Smartphone Controls\nThe 3D map movement controls and UI have been revamped!\nThe map jumping function has been improved along with various other adjustments, making gameplay even smoother than before.\n\n\n■ Additional Contents\n\n・Intimacy Gallery\nIntimacy Events have been compiled in gallery form!\nReplay your favorite characters and events whenever you want, as many times as you want.\n\n・Character Gallery\nAllows players to view character sprites and lines in a gallery.\nIf you ever get the urge to hear that one line, now you can!\n\n・Ultimate Gallery\nA gallery full of promotional illustrations and character sheets from the official art book.\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n[Supported OS]\r\niOS 11.0 and above.\r\n*Not supported on certain devices.\r\n\r\n[Supported Languages]\r\nText: English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese\r\nAudio: English, Japanese"

In five different game modes you'll have to learn to handle a shotgun like an expert and hit rapidly flying targets from varying angles! Including Arcade Challenge featuring upgrades, power-ups and unlimited gameplay.\n\nSkeet and trap shooting enthusiast all around the world praise Clay Hunt for it's realistic physics and authenticity:\n\n\"I shoot trap on a regular basis and have been looking for a realistic clay shooting game. Look no further,this is it.\"\n\n\"Best Shooting Game App Period” \n\n\"Love this game - bought it thinking it might be fun but it's far more than that - brilliant fun - always trying to beat my previous best. Play with headphones and the shotgun sound is so accurate - just like the real thing. RECOMMENDED\"\n\n\"Excellent !!!! Le top !!!!!\"\n\n\"Shoot clays at the weekend have been shooting about three months with some coaching. Some targets I can hit no problem, others I just cant hit. I was looking for a clay simulator to try and analyse my mistakes. I was sure my problem was reading the targets and my searching bought me to this game.\nFirst thing I noticed was the target presentations were all familiar to me and the ones I can shoot in the real world I can shoot in the game. Targets I cant hit for real I cant hit in the game either. So I played it for four says straight learning where to place the shot for various targets at various stages of flight. Off to the range today I shot my best round ever, and I mean massive difference. Missed some fast crossers then hit them by increasing the lead a little. It has helped me build up target pictures in my head so I take them more instinctively. \nThanks for a truly useful app. I was going to spring for another lesson out of desperation, another £75 but Im going to stick with this for a while\"\n\nFeatures:\n• Real life physics for clay bird trajectories and leads\n• Unique multi-touch controls\n• Authentic graphics and sound effects\n• Tutorial mode, where you can practice your shotgun handling\n• Three classic clay pigeon shooting modes (similar to skeet shooting or trap shooting)\n• Arcade challenge with weapon upgrades, power-ups and endless challenge\n• Three shotguns: double barrel and two semi-automatics\n• Game Center Leaderboards and Achievements\n----------\n\nSee also the new Clay Hunt PRO - Advanced Shotgun Shooting Simulator\n\nIf you encounter any problems please send e-mail. You can also try to restart the device and make sure you have the latest software version of the game and your device."

It's the same game with quite a few twists, such as an added penalty card (10 of Diamonds) and the ability to announce penalty cards for double the points.  You may also play partnership games, (aka likha) and tear apart the other team.\n\nThere's no pleasantries in Sibeeta such as breaking hearts, starting with 2 of clubs, or shooting the moon.  Your focus is to completely obliterate your opponents even if they take every point in the deck.\n\n- Online multiplayer support!\n\n- If you're new to the game, there's a \"How to Play\" that should get you started out.\n\n- Not your standard Hearts bots, trust me.\n\n- Partnership games.\n\n- Option to add jokers as wildcards.

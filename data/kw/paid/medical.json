Simply enter the known variable and the data is instantly calculated. \n\nDeveloped by an Emergency Physician, this app minimizes the risk of medical errors allowing the provider to spend more time caring for the patient, and less time looking up and calculating doses.  \n\nIt is a critical companion for any physician, nurse, paramedic, or medical trainee involved in the care of critically ill pediatric patients."

This award winning program reliably analyzes and diagnoses your baby’s cry, then recommends helpful solutions – all in less than 5 seconds! Is your baby hungry, sleepy, annoyed, stressed or bored? The Cry Translator will tell you. Click “…More” to learn why you should download this App today!\n\n- Awarded Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n\n-  I love it ! A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor. This application is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We assume no liability for any personal harm or injury sustained as a result of using this application."

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

With V. 2.0 we added clinic videos.\n\n- How would you perform a post-extraction cross suture on a patient taking anticoagulant medication so as to keep the haemostatic sponge in the socket in place?\n\n- How would you perform a simple continuous suture after multiple extractions and/or alveolar ridge correction?\n\nThese are just two of the questions this application answers. In both cases, a loop suture would have been  less effective and a waste of time.\n\nThe list of suturing techniques dealt with in this application, which currently stands at 9, will be gradually increased with free updates.

Wherever you are within the allied health professions - medical school, nursing school, NP school, PA school, residency, and beyond - you can improve your knowledge base in the short and long term with these key associative memory aids.\n\nMedical Mnemonics puts 1796 clever acronyms, rhymes, and memory tricks on your iPhone or iPod Touch, covering topics ranging from Anatomy and Biochemistry to Pharmacology and Surgery.\n\nThe database is fully searchable and can be quickly filtered by discipline and by system. Create a Favorites list, and search and filter it similarly.\n\nThe best mnemonics can be those you make yourself. Add your own mnemonics to the database, where they'll appear seamlessly alongside those which come with the program.  Submit them instantaneously to the Medical Mnemonics server for review by an MD (that's me!) and inclusion in the next version.\n\nYou can email any mnemonic to a colleague from within Medical Mnemonics. He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human.

Have a business trip?  Milk Maid will calculate the average milk you used last week to help you estimate how long your stash will last.\n\n* Set an expiration period for each storage location and Milk Maid will track the expiration time of each bottle/bag in your stash.  Browse the stash to see containers that are nearing expiration or expired.\n\n* Use Milk Maid's optional features like the handy timer if your pump does not have one and the Left/Right feature to track each side separately.\n\n* Milk Maid supports oz or mL or both.  Milk Maid remembers which units you used last so you don't have to keep entering it over again.\n\n* Browse and edit your entire history of pumpings and feedings.\n\n* Quickly and easily browse your entire inventory of fresh and frozen milk in multiple locations.  See the total volume stored in each location.\n\n* Export all data in CSV (spreadsheet) and RTF (word processing) format via email or wifi to share with your caregiver or healthcare provider."

(Non-English and French Devices will show the English Version only).  Proceeds from the sale of this App supports future development of the CTAS and its educational materials.\n\nThis application walks the user through patient complaints in assisting nurses and physicians to assign acuity levels using the complaint oriented triage lists and modifiers.  All lists and modifier definitions and data are within the application and therefore no data connection is required.\n\nBy using the official application, nurses and physicians can be assured that they are using the most current and accurate scale as developed and revised by the National Working Group.\n\nTriage accurately! It helps patients receive the care and measures your acuity and volume against other facilities with reliability.  The CTAS is used in many countries around the world for setting patient priority.\n\nThe Canadian Triage & Acuity Scale (CTAS) is a tool that enables Emergency Departments (ED) to:\n\n•Prioritize patient care requirements\n•Examine patient care processes, workload, and resource requirements relative to case mix and community needs\n\nThe CTAS allows ED nurses and physicians to:\n•Triage patients according the type and severity of their presenting signs and symptoms\n•Ensure that the sickest patients are seen first when ED capacity has been exceeded due to visit rates or reduced access to other services\n•Ensure that a patient's need for care is reassessed while in the ED\n\nThe CTAS allows ED managers to:\n•Measure the case mix (volume and acuity) of patients who visit the ED\n•Determine whether the ED has an operational plan and the resources to meet patient needs\n•Assess the ED's role within the hospital and health care region\n\nThe triage level assigned using the CTAS criteria is a mandatory data element to be used in all Canadian Hospital Emergency Departments for reporting to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).\n\nTraining in the use of the CTAS in the clinical context is recommended before using this application to assist in clinical decision-making."

Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

      "label": "* The world's number 1 DAF app is used by thousands of people in over one hundred countries. *\n\nDAF Professional has been created to help people who stammer or have a neurological disease such as Parkinson's Disease. It helps people to slow their rate of speech which makes it clearer to others.\n\nDAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.\n\nDAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT). DAF Professional delivers incredibly low latency feedback even when running in the background.\n\nDelayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly. However, until recently, devices have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used.\n\nDAF was originally developed for people who stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010).\n\nIt works by enabling someone to hear his or her own speech in an altered manner. This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups however DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions.\n\nWhen using Bluetooth devices there is an additional delay of 60ms added to the feedback system.\n\nIf you do use a Bluetooth headset you may find you need to turn the bluetooth device on after opening the app to enable it.\n\nDAF Professional works when put in the background or the screen is turned off. Like all apps of this type, it can NOT work during phone calls or with other media apps playing at the same time.\n\nIf you wish to provide any feedback we would be delighted to hear from you. Please email us at support@speechtools.co.\n\nOur lead Speech and Language Therapist is Samantha Brady who qualified as a Speech and Language Therapist in 2001 (PGDip, City University) and gained her Masters in Speech and Language Therapy in 2006 (MSc, City University). She has a wealth of experience of working as a Speech and Language Therapist in a variety of settings and her area of clinical expertise is adult neurology and voice. Samantha is a member of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT), HPC Registered (SL10250) and Lee Silverman Voice Treatment Certified (LSVT).\n\nDAF Professional is fully GDPR compliant and will not collect any of your data without first asking for your consent."

      "label": "The Pill is optimized for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.\n\nHave you ever forgotten to take your birth control pill ? It can happen to any of us but now with The Pill iPhone App, it may never happen again. \n\nThe Pill will remind you to take your birth control pill every day at a time you choose, with a local notification alert (similar to an SMS). The application does not need to be running in order to receive the alert. Works also in plane mode.\n \nWhy not set yourself an alarm on your mobile? \nThe Pill iPhone app is much more than a simple alarm. \n\nThe Pill automatically calculates the 7 days stop period, and the 21 days when you are actually taking the pill. If you are using a 28 day pack then alerts will be sent to you every day. Alerts will not be sent during the 7 days stop period, they only occur during the 21 days when you are actually taking your pill. \n\nYou can see exactly when you have to take your pill, compare your real package with the one in the actual application and see if you have missed a pill or not. \n\nOther features include:  \n\n- Customizable alert sound and background color\n- Alerts received via email\n- Extra alert request option \n\nThe female contraceptive pill is the most popular method of contraception, with 38% of women currently taking it. However, the Pill needs to be used consistently and correctly in order to be effective.  Some types of contraceptive pill have to be taken at exactly the same time every day.  This is why this iPhone app, The Pill, is so important to help prevent unwanted or unplanned pregnancies. \n \nAdvice: take your pill in the morning, if ever you forget to take it, you still can remember it during the day, it won't be too late (after getting asleep, you increase the risk to be more than 12 (or 3) hours late). \n\n-----\nterms & conditions\n\nIn order to receive the notification, you must allow the notifications (settings menu on your iphone) and be connected on internet. WiFi connection may cause problems with notifications especially if the iPhone is in sleep mode, we advice to stay connected with 3G. The Pill also work without internet be you need to let the application running to hear the alarm.\n\nWe cannot be held liable for any breakdowns or faults on our application. Receiving the push notification is not 100% guaranteed even if we do our best to make it work all the time."

A detailed manual with 14 chapters is an ideal companion if you are a medical student, radiology resident, radiographer, a medic on the ward or preparing for board exams. It teaches the beginner (and perhaps not so much of a beginner) the technique of interpreting a chest radiograph. Over 70 flash cards on specific conditions provide short and succinct information, ideal when that odd looking film shows up on the screen. Unlike a traditional book, each condition is provided with multiple example images for better understanding.\n\nThanks to the beautiful high resolution screen, iCXR virtually turns your device to a mini PACS work station. Zoom the image by using familiar pinch gestures, use built in tools to change contrast and brightness and invert the image for a near real life experience. Over 100 detailed pictorial and text annotations superimposed on the images help better understanding. You can turn off the annotations to appreciate the findings better.\n\niCXR – The modern chest radiograph reference.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Works on both iPhone and iPad with a single purchase\n \n- No internet connection required\n\n- Largest chest radiograph library on the iphone \n\n- High quality zoomable radiographs\n\n- Zoomable text and pictorial annotations overlaid on the image that can be toggled\n\n- Multiple examples per condition\n\n- Links from text to appropriate images\n\n- Image manipulation tools that simulate a PACS work station\n\n- Manual to teach chest radiograph interpretation\n\n- Flash cards for quick reference"

Hold it at least 5cm away from the object you want to enlarge and allow the camera to focus on it first (image is brought into focus). Then slowly move the slide switch to enlarge. If the camera does not focus properly, please increase the distance to the object and make a control for the automatic focus (focus not locked) and lighting conditions. Click once for full screen view and then once more for normal. In the full screen view, you can even zoom by spreading the image with your fingers. Clicking the red button will create a snapshot of the zoomed image. It is then saved to your photo album.\nTip: No fast movements!"

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Cholesterol management is a complex, necessary task in a huge number of patient encounters. We know that getting it right is a vital part of promoting long-term health. Let ATP3 Lipids help!\r\n\r\nThe Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults - or the ATP III for short - describes the evidence-based cholesterol testing and management recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program. These guidelines categorize lipid levels by lipoprotein type, define cholesterol goals based on specific patient characteristics, and describe therapeutic recommendations for management of cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids puts fast and thorough access to this cholesterol management algorithm on your iPhone or iPod Touch, from your patients' specific cholesterol goals to details of cholesterol management drugs (dosing, percentage change, side effects, and contraindications).\r\n\r\nYou input your patients' data - lipid panel by numbers and risk factors by simply tapping to select. Input is beautiful and easy, using the popular interface from MediMath.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids then shows you the lipid classifications and specific therapeutic recommendations of the ATP III based on the lipid panel and risk factors.  You can tap a recommendation to view further information.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids includes a complete Framingham Cardiac Risk calculator which is automatically presented for use if the patient's risk factors indicate a need to evaluate the hard 10-year cardiac risk.\r\n\r\nThe info button at the top-right displays the ATP III algorithm and reference tables in textual form (the Quick Desk Reference on which the ATP3 Lipids therapeutic recommendations are based).  Tapping the 'Show Full Report' button from the info screen switches to the complete 284 page ATP III final report.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids keeps track of the last information you entered and restores it when launched, with a Clear button easily accessible to begin working up the next patient.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n • ATP III based, patient-specific cholesterol goals\r\n • ATP III based, patient-specific therapeutic recommendations\r\n • Lipid lowering drug reference, with dosing, expected lipid effects, side effects, and contraindications\r\n • Metabolic syndrome reference, with criteria and recommendations\r\n • Both executive summary and complete text of the ATP III report included\r\n • Support for US and SI units\r\n\r\nIf you love the program, please leave a review.

This app will test your ability to identify electrocardiogram rhythms. Recognition of ECG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will evaluate your resuscitation skills better than reviewing with a book because you have to diagnose the rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\n\nThe app utilizes an organized four Criteria approach to identify the rhythms. You can also study the Description of the rhythm to review the electrophysiology. Use the same process to test yourself and review all the ECG rhythms.\n\nWhen you feel you have mastered the rhythms in this program you should review the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support algorithms using the app Anesoft 'ACLS Sim 2016'."

      "label": "This app is intended for obstetricians, midwives, and nurses who use electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) in laboring patients.   In addition to interpreting fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings, health care professionals must communicate with each other about the tracings in a way that is understood by all parties, and decide what action to take.\n\nFHR 5-tier is based on the five-color system developed by Drs. Julian Parer and Tomoaki Ikeda.  (AJOG July 2007) The intent of their system is to standardize management of different fetal heart rate tracings. The system divides all fetal heart rate tracings into one of five categories:  Green (no acidemia, no intervention required), Blue, Yellow, Orange or Red (evidence of actual or impending fetal asphyxia, rapid delivery recommended).   Each color has assigned to it a:  a) risk of acidemia, b) risk of evolution to a more serious pattern and c) recommended action.\n\nThe NICHD three-tier system of classifying fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings has been criticized for having too wide a range of tracings in “Category II”. Some researchers and clinicians believe that the five-tier color-coded system more effectively classifies EFM tracings.  The five-tier system is being adopted by an increasing number of hospitals in the U.S. and in Japan.\n\nFHR 5-tier makes it easier to use the five-color system.\n\nWithout the FHR 5-tier app, one must refer to a table with 134 possible combinations of variability, baseline, and decelerations.  One must also either memorize or refer to the definitions for mild, moderate and severe decelerations, which are complex and sometimes confusing.\n\nWhen using the FHR 5-tier app it is not necessary to refer to any other table or chart. Variability and baseline, and the shape, nadir, and duration of decelerations are entered with buttons on the consecutive screens. The app calculates the severity of the deceleration and the color for each tracing.  All aspects of the tracing are summarized on the colored results screen, so that the user can quickly communicate with others.\n\nManagement recommendations as outlined by Parer and Ikeda are given. These include whether or not the obstetrician needs to be at the bedside; what other personnel should be available; and whether the patient should be moved to the operating room.  In addition, conservative management techniques are listed where appropriate.  Thus, for Blue, Yellow, and Orange tracings, the final results screen reminds the user to consider actions such as maternal position change, decreasing oxytocin, or amnioinfusion.  \n\nAs noted by Parer and Ikeda, the guidelines for management may need to be modified for institutions other then theirs, and may even change depending on time of day.\n\nThe NICHD Category (I, II, III) is also given on the results screen.\n\n This application is intended as a reference tool for use only by licensed healthcare professionals.  This application is not a substitute for each licensed healthcare professional's independent clinical judgment.  No medical decision should be based solely on information obtained by use of this tool.  \n\n\nThis application tries to faithfully aggregate information from major authorities (see references) and does not introduce or substitute the judgment of the makers of this application for those authorities.

Easily saves 10+ minutes per patient -- seriously, an RD's best friend.\n\nBased on daily routines across all types of patients, we jammed EVERYTHING we need into just 3 simple screens. We've thoroughly tested the app in our own daily routines over the past year, and can't imagine not having this app anymore.\n\nWe've double-checked calculations many times and automated everything including tube feeding formulas where possible, so you don't have to. \n\n\nScreen 1: Quick Nutrition Needs --\nQuickly determine BMI, IBW, kcal needs (both MSJ and Penn State, for on or off ventilation), and protein needs. Easily account for stress factor and protein multipliers.\n\nScreen 2: Instant Tube Feeds --\nDetermine total volume, kcal, gm protein, %kcal protein, gm CHO, %kcal CHO, and mL free H2O in literally seconds. \n\nScreen 3: Parental Nutrition (TPN) calculator --\nInput rate and duration, and either grams or percentage dextrose/amino acids/lipids to determine total volume, kcal, gm protein, gm CHO, GIR, and gm fat/kg. Works for both 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 methods.\n\n\nWe made this app to fulfill our own biggest painpoints, but after realizing how indispensable it's become to us, we hope it's helpful for others now too. \n\nFeedback from clinical RDs is welcome! Just tweet us @NutricalcApp"

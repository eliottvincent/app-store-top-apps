      "label": "Did you just experience an earthquake? Find out how close and how big it was with iFeltThat, the most customizable worldwide earthquake app for the iPhone and iPod touch.\n\niFeltThat retrieves information directly from official USGS sources to show you seven days of microquake activity as low as magnitude 1.0 in most U.S. regions. Earthquake lists for U.S. regions show you precisely where an event occurred (not just \"Northern California,\" but \"5 mi SE of Santa Rosa, CA\"). Rotate any list view to see the region-wide map. You can also see at a glance how many citizens reported the event to the USGS \"Did You Feel It?\" service\n\nIn addition to 20 region-specific event listings around the world (visit support page for a complete list), iFeltThat features a Nearby region, which uses your current location as a center point. Add an unlimited number of center points from your Address Book to keep an eye on seismic activity near your family and friends (or your own hometown while you travel) down to magnitude 1.0 in the U.S. (4.5 elsewhere). Or set a center point from any event location around the world to monitor earthquake swarms within 500 miles of the center point.\n\nView single-event and interactive region-wide maps in roadmap or satellite hybrid styles. All maps are pinch-zoomable and draggable, just like the Maps app. Optional one-touch zoom buttons in detail maps let you zoom in and out quickly for one-handed operation while on the go. Tap the Newer and Older buttons to navigate instantly from quake detail to quake detail without having to go back to the list.\n\nWhenever a ••USGS Shake Map•• is available for an event, a special icon appears in that event's detail view. Tap the icon to see the Shake Map within iFeltThat. In fact, all related web pages (including direct access to North American and Pacific/Indian Ocean ••Tsunami Warnings••) appear inside the app. Also from inside the app, send an email with info, links, and a screenshot of an event detail screen/map to anyone you like.\n\nCustomize which four regions are ready to view at a single tap on the bottom bar. For each region list, set the minimum magnitude threshold and default map zoom level.\n\nOne earthquake may have brought you to iFeltThat. You'll be so intrigued monitoring unexpected earth movements near you and around the world that you may find yourself using IFeltThat more often than you check the weather or news."

It even shows you the song history of your favorite FM/AM radio stations, so you can find out what you just heard.\n\nUltimate Song Finder\nSearch for a song and listen to it right now. Our songbots are actively searching over 90,000 (AM/FM/Internet) stations and finding out what they’re playing in real-time. Tell your personal Songbot what you want to hear, and it'll find the station that's playing the song right now. No more waiting for your favorite song to come on.\n\nAll Your Local AM/FM Radio Stations\nSongbot will give you all of your local AM/FM radio stations as well as the ones slightly further away from your radio's reception reach all in high quality. You can even enter another town's zip code to get stations playing in another city.\n\nListen to Today's Most Played Songs\nSongbot will also list the most played songs over the last 48 hours on radio, and then let you listen to them instantly. Songbot even lists the top songs by genre, so there's something for everyone.\n\nView a Station's Song History\nSongbot lets you see all the songs you just listened to, so you can listen to them again at anytime. You can even see what was playing in the past few hours on any station and be able to start listening to any of those songs listed. It's almost like rewinding a radio station.\n\nPlay YouTube Videos with the Screen Off\nSongbot not only gives you the music videos to the songs you want to hear, you can turn off the screen and continue playing the audio by simply pressing the power button twice, and then pressing Play. You can also use other apps while the audio plays in the background.\n\nSmart Favorites\nYou can save the song, artist or station as part of your favorites, so you can always get to what you want with just one tap. We also keep track of your song history for you, so you can always find that song that you just heard but forgot to add to your favorites.\n\nFind Stations Similar to Your Favorite\nIf you have a favorite AM/FM radio station, Songbot can help you find similar ones from around the world. The great thing is that you don't have to be near them to listen to them. Songbot connects you to them through the internet. And since it's only audio, it will use less bandwidth than listening to a song on a video website. It also doesn't have to do all that buffering that a video website would have to do. The songs play almost instantly.\n\nDiscover New Stations\nTired of the same stations you've already heard on your car radio? In Songbot 2.0, we've included premium stations. Now you can find stations that are playing music that you otherwise wouldn't find in your car stereo system. For example, perhaps you like K-Pop, Anime, or Cinematic music. Perhaps you want a station that only plays Eminem songs. We have that for you!\n\nRadio Talk Shows and Sports Included\nNo matter if you're looking for Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, Rush Limbaugh, Rachel Maddow, or NPR; Songbot will find a station for you that's playing their talk show. Want to listen in on the latest game? Songbot will help you find a station that's broadcasting it live.\n\nAdvanced Recommendation Engine\nWant to find other musicians similar to your favorite band? Use Songbot's advanced recommendation engine to pick out radio stations for you based on your favorite artists. Or you can just start listening to a station, and Songbot will suggest other stations to listen to that play similar music. Discover new music this way. It's also good for skipping around when a commercial comes on on your current station."

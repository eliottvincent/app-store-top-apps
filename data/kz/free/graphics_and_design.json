Every professional needs a business card or a visiting card. \n\nHere is the business card maker app that helps you to create creative business cards.\n\nKey Features\n- Insert texts like your name, company name, mobile number, email address, website, etc... \n- Select your business card from various business card designs.\n- Custom Design Editor\n- Save or Share business card\n- Save your business time without any designer.\n\nWhen you meet someone that could potentially be a great prospect or connection, don’t you want him or her to walk away with a great first impression?\nA memorable business card does a lot more than just pass on an email address or phone number.\n\nCreative business cards get shared -- continuing to market for you.\n\nA business card is a physical object that a potential prospect leaves the encounter with. Your brand stays with them.\n\nIf you meet a prospect and exchange email addresses and phone numbers you each walk away with another contact on your mobile phone -- it ends there. If you hand over a creative business card that makes a great impression that a person is likely to show it to other people -- putting you and your brand in front of additional prospects.\n\nBusiness cards show you are prepared.\n\nThe Importance of Business Cards For Professionals\n\n1. Business cards give people the ability to follow up\n\n2. Business cards show that you are a professional\n3. Having a business card keeps one focused on the goal\n4. Business cards can help make you referable\n5. Luck happens when preparation meets opportunity.\n\nIn saying that make sure that you always have your business cards with you so when the opportunity comes you are already prepared and you too may get “lucky” and find success.\n\nBusiness cards put a face to a business – When meeting someone new, handing them your business card (preferably with your photo on it) will help keep your business in the back of their minds. Though they may not need your product or services today, there may come a time when they do, and hopefully, they will be able to pull out your business card and call versus trying to remember your company name and searching the web.\n\nHow to create your professional business card?\n- Incorporate QR codes in your business card\n- Spend more on quality\n- Choose the right font\n- Consider professional help\n\nIf you choose to subscribe to any of the “Business Card Maker Pro” Subscriptions, the payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. any unused portion of the free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication.

      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

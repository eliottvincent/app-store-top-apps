You can print a hardcopy of your iPhone contacts. \n7. You can now export iPhone contacts to an Excel file which can then be imported to Outlook Contacts directly. \n8. You can also import contacts from an Excel file that has been exported from Outlook to your iPhone.\n9. You can now export/import iPhone contacts to/from a Gmail CSV-format file(UTF-8 encoded or Unicode encoded).\n10. You can upload export files over to Dropbox/GoogleDrive or download import files from Dropbox/GoogleDrive.\n11. You can password protect your export file.\n12. All Contact fields except Ringtones can be exported/imported.\n13. You can organise your contacts into groups easily on a spreadsheet and also assign a contact to multiple groups.\n14.

In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

The ability to monitor business performance with sales and labor snapshots from anywhere, keeps them out of the back office.

      "label": "This application offers a unique approach to project management, which represents your project not just as a plan, but as a coordinated mechanism moving towards the goal. \n\nThe original technique allows you to break down project objectives into smaller goals, processes and resources, but not get lost in the details, but always see the overall structure of the project as a whole. After all, project management is not a mechanical observance of the plan, but the achievement of project goals, which should not be overlooked.\n\nThe application combines the classic project approach based on Gantt charts and project management through workflow diagrams. As a rule, Gantt charts are ideal for presenting project schedules, but they are not so convenient for reflecting the complex structure of the relationship between processes, goals and resources.\n\nMore formally, the program allows you to build a customized, based on the BPMN notation, PERT diagram of the project (with events and processes at nodes). Then this description of the project is used to generate a Gantt chart and track the progress of the project. \n\nSo, inShort is a powerful project and business process management tool, which can be applied not only in office but also for personal purposes. You can further explore the capabilities of the program with the detailed interactive User Guide.\n\nKey features of the application: \n• Building the diagram of processes and resources of the project (PERT network diagram of the project, based on BPMN notation). \n• The ability to drill down the elements of workflow diagrams. \n• Tracking the execution of the project. \n• Integration with the standard Calendar.\n• Displaying the list of project tasks in the form of a Gantt chart. \n• Separation of physical and information flows of the project. \n• Ability to specify the expected time of execution, both directly and parametrically. \n• Export of charts into PDF files and OPML outlines.\n• Project management according to the methodology of the Theory of Constraints. \n• Working calendars taking into account various schedules of work for implementation of tasks. \n• Work resources and their assignment to tasks. \n• Queues of tasks: organize the work with active tasks in accordance with the elements of the GTD methodology.\n• Checklists for diagrams — monitor the sequence of actions for project management step by step.\n\nAdvanced features of project management in accordance with the Theory of Constraints technique: \n• finding the critical path; \n• positioning of time buffers of the project; \n• calculation of buffer sizes; \n• calculation of late starts for feeding paths of the project; \n• tracking of time indicators during project execution. \n\n***\ninShort Pro — application version for experienced and advanced users, contains advanced and service functions useful for in-depth work with diagrams.\nFunctions included in inShort Pro:\n• Working with layers of diagrams;\n• inReview: publications of user diagrams surveys by experienced project managers, indicating successful findings and weaknesses in the diagrams. The procedure for sending diagrams for analysis is described in the Terms of Use.\n\nThe inShort Pro version is available by monthly subscription. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\ninShort Pro Subscription Terms of Use link: http://www.shortki.com/inShort/proTerms.html\n***\n\nCannot solve a problem? Draw it inShort and sort things out with it there. It's like voodoo but it works."

      "label": "Nano Enterprise Management is a simple, yet powerful application for small and medium-sized businesses that helps you efficiently oversee purchases, sales, production, warehouses, and finances right from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch – and all without internet access or any special skills. There is also a desktop version of the app that is fully compatible with the mobile version.\nIn multi-user mode, you can locate the database on the Web hosting and connect to it all your users. To differentiate the users’ permissions in the application, the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented.\n\nThe application's primary purpose is to efficiently manage purchases and product sales for small companies. Nano Enterprise Management is also an excellent fit for any firm that provides services (auto mechanics, hair salons, etc.) or does basic production (assembling computers, crafting furniture, etc.). Thanks to its precise modular structure, all changes in one module are instantly reflected in the others. You can also take advantage of the easy-to-use configuration tool to flexibly adjust settings for various attributes (for example, new products arriving to a warehouse will instantly become available to be ordered while factoring in characteristics such as color, size, material, etc.). The special service planner allows you to flexibly manage resources, personnel, and workstations on the basis of actual load. For example, you could distribute incoming orders to various technicians based on their work schedules, rates, and specializations. All information is visible in real time, so at any time you can check how many orders are currently being processed, how many payments have come in from customers, how much stock is remaining in the warehouse, and how much cash the company has on hand. Deposits and withdrawals have been simplified to the highest degree possible, so even an inexperienced user can easily make sense of them.\n\nAnother major advantage is the attractive, elegant reports with flexible filters that allow you to instantly create excerpts based on the exact time period and data you need at a given moment. The most important information is collected in the \"Marginal Revenue\" report, where you can view your total profits for a selected time interval broken up by region, customer, store, or other factors.\n\nAnd, finally, Nano Enterprise Management stores all data locally (no internet access required), supports data transfer between tablets, and can create backup copies and manage them via email, iCloud, or Dropbox. If you frequently work on a computer or laptop, just install the desktop version of the application (for MacOS), which has the same features as the mobile version.\n\nMoreover, the application is provided along with a tutorial database for your convenience. As soon as you learn your way around the application you can feel free to delete the test data and upload your own.\n\nQuestions?\nPlease email us for help or to give suggestions. We love to hear how businesses are using our app!\n\nE-mail: erziman@gmail.com"

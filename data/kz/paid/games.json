Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realise your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system! \n\nAwesome Add-Ons: SlopeMania & Trains\n\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes!

Only a few people managed to survive in that deadly attack that hit the planet from the space, but after a short time a new catastrophe started to threaten the survivors. And the main character, the Chosen of the North-216 Community, will have to deal with it. \n\nWorld of the post-apocalypse. First person shooter for survival.\n\nThe Sun Origin: Post-apocalyptic action — is a first-person shooter with RPG elements with its own history, hundreds of tasks, a huge arsenal of weapons and armor, trade, fighting factions, mutants, bandits and prowlers. Explore the world with a huge number of locations, buy the best weapons from the merchants and improve them. You will need only the best equipment! After all, your main goal is to save your Community from hunger. And let the struggle for survival begin!!!\n\nBrief background.\n\nIn the year 2050, the sun unleashed a catastrophic surge of energy into space, a wave of power that would plunge our civilization into chaos for centuries. Though predicted for years by the scientific community, their warnings were ignored by the world leaders that instead squabbled over petty territorial concerns.\n\nWhen the wave of energy struck the earth, a storm of radioactive particles blanketed the atmosphere in a deadly, carcinogenic fog. The fog killed indiscriminately… the young, old, rich and poor all fell in equal measure. Only those that had heeded the warnings and taken shelter in abandoned bunkers were spared. \n\nWhen their supplies eventually ran out and these communities were forced to emerge from their shelters, they saw a new world of desolation and chaos. A world in which the laws of civilization had been replaced by the law of the gun. The few areas that still had clean water and arable land were held by ruthless warlords and their armies.\n\nIt was in this world that a warrior known only as Raven would emerge. A warrior that would save his people by bending the wasteland to his will. A warrior that would one day become a legend.\n\nIt's a challenge! The world of the apocalypse or you?"

By constantly intertwining and replacing each other, they maintain balance. The main character named OVO was born of these two halves and has the ability to switch between them. OVO travels through the metaphorical world, overcoming dangers and collecting mysterious symbols. These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.\n\nFeatures:\n■\tFlow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black—upward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being carried by a flow.\n\n■\tFascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions.\n\n■\tDesign without words. There is almost no text in the game and the story is told through gameplay and visuals.\n\n■\tMeditative ambient soundtrack by Brokenkites."

Your goal is to fulfill your dream, create passive income and accumulate enough savings. \n\nYou can also develop as a person and find a life/work balance. Start a family. Get rid of bad habits. Avoid common money mistakes. Stop wasting. Help your parents. Do sports. Give to charity. But don't delay, you need to win before your retirement! \n\nSince it's impossible to do everything, you need to learn how to invest your time the same way you invest your money. Study time management and plan your time carefully, and choose what's important and what's not. \n\nTimeflow is based on popular business simulators like Monopoly, Cashflow, Life, Payday, and the Tycoon series. It's also based on books by authors Robert Kiyosaki, Steven Covey, and Bryan Tracy.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Sometimes on the slopes Sven can find fast Snowmobiles which can ferry multiple animals a maintain a very high top speed.\n\nStaying ahead of the avalanche has its advantages and perks. Completing objectives can 'level up' Sven  and increase his score multiplier. Riding animals, performing backflips add to the score and with an increased score multiplier Sven will rocketing up the highscore table with ease."

Be careful though: leading has never been easy and it will be even more challenging in a similar world.

Every single event might help you reach your final victory, but at the same time it could be the reason of your failure. Who will be your friend, and who will be your enemy? Hard to say in such a complex world filled with betrayals, aliens, bionic beings and ancient myths.

      "label": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!"

The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift).

      "label": "\"Did you know that “Schadenfreude” is a German word defined as the concept of finding joy in someone else’s misfortune? It is also the main idea on which Neighbours back From Hell is built. A whole TV show based on playing increasingly outrageous pranks on your grumpy neighbor to keep the audience entertained, and viewership numbers high. It’s good to be bad in this early 2000s trash TV-inspired slapstick extravaganza! \n\nAs Woody, the vengeful star protagonist of Neighbours back From Hell, you will prank your way through Seasons 1 and 2 of the fictitious, but aptly named TV show. Take the mischief from your nasty neighbor’s flat all the way to China, India, and Mexico where you will make sure his holiday is a living hell. While you’re at it, why limit targeting your antics at your neighbor, when you can involve his mother and fellow travelers? Whatever you decide to do, your trusty camera crew will be right there and keep a keen eye on all the action. You can let your crooked creativity flow freely and watch the neighbor rage in desperation. Just be mindful not to get caught by him or his companions, or they will whoop you good and your TV show will be taken off the air. If you perform well on the other hand, by creating more and more disarray and chaos in the neighbor’s life, ratings will increase, and you could win prestigious awards. \"\n\nNeighbours From Hell 1 & 2 Remastered in one package: 28 episodes set in the neighbor’s home, on a cruise liner, and in several different holiday locations around the world \n\n- All graphics newly rendered in Full HD \n- Framerate of all animations doubled for a smoother experience  \n- Use stealth, skill, and style to perform the perfect ambush \n- Easy to use interface and controls \n- Superb cartoon-style graphics \n- Big band soundtrack \n- Game Center support\r\n- Full controller support\n\n© HandyGames"

Игра позволяет развить ассоциативное и логическое мышление, улучшить актерское мастерство и ораторское искусство.\n\nИгра отлично подходит для компаний, различных вечеринок и встреч с друзьями. Она позволяет познакомиться, раскрепоститься, создать веселую и праздничную атмосферу.\n\nКрокодил - это интеллектуальная игра. Она расширяет словарный запас и заставляет вспоминать слова, о которых вы уже не помните.\n\nСлова для игры крокодил содержат около 1000 вещей окружающего мира (персонажи, спорт, профессии, пословицы, еда, праздники, эмоции и многое другое). Выбери одну из категорий и нажми СТАРТ!\n\nИгра стала настолько знаменитой, что в нее играют в клубах, смотрят на ТВ и онлайн. Но намного интереснее собрать старых друзей, взять бочонок пива и сразиться в нее в обычной квартире!\n\nЭто игра для Дня рождения, Нового года, корпоратива, выпускного, да и вообще любого праздника!"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

As if all of that weren't enough, you'll also need to set up laser traps in the vents, collect Faz-Coins, purchase items from the Prize Counter, and as always, keep a close eye on not one, but two, Pirate Cove curtains!\n\nOther features also included:\n- Challenge menu including sixteen themed challenges\n- Voice acting from returning favorites as well as from new arrivals to the franchise\n- Unlockable office skins\n- Unlockable cutscenes\n\nNOTE: Game entirely in English.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the subscription price option you have previously selected.\n\nYour subscription can be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.

Featuring 50 selectable animatronic characters spanning seven Five Nights at Freddy's games, the options for customization are nearly endless. Mix and match any assortment of characters that you like, set their difficulty from 0-20, then jump right into the action! From your office desk, you will need to manage two side doors, two vents, as well as two air hoses, all of which lead directly into your office.\n\nThis time you will have to master other tools as well if you want to complete the ultimate challenges, tools such as the heater, A/C, a global music box, a power generator, and more. As if all of that weren't enough, you'll also need to set up laser traps in the vents, collect Faz-Coins, purchase items from the Prize Counter, and as always, keep a close eye on not one, but two, Pirate Cove curtains!\n\nOther features also included:\n- Challenge menu including sixteen themed challenges\n- Voice acting from returning favorites as well as from new arrivals to the franchise\n- Unlockable office skins\n- Unlockable cutscenes\n\nNOTE: Game entirely in English.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

Keep your focus as you guide two orbiting planets down a path without breaking their perfect equilibrium.\n\nIt's pretty hard to describe, but you should play the free online version on a desktop computer first if you are not sure if you would enjoy this game!\n\nFeatures:\n\n- More than 10 worlds, each introducing new shapes and rhythms. What do triangles, octagons or squares sound like? Each world starts with small tutorial stages and ends with a final test.\n\n- Post-game challenges: Speed Trials for each world and a blisteringly fast bonus level for the brave.\n\n- Calibration options: auto-calibration and manual calibration. This is a precise rhythm game, so use your ears more than your eyes when playing.\n\n- Play new levels for free: more levels will be added over the coming months.\n\nWARNING: This is a hard rhythm game. Not in the sense of note-spamming - for the most part all you have to do is keep a consistent beat - but this is a good test of whether you would be a good drummer. Keeping a beat is not very easy, and then weird breakbeats are added on top of that, so don't worry if you find it difficult!"

      "label": "When the implacable Professor Helsing and his assistant Raffton travel to The Shadow Blight, they'll need every weapon at their disposal to defeat Dracula's vampire horde. In this captivating, dark Gothic puzzle-adventure, use Dr. Helsing's powerful torch and tonics to save the world from the demonic uprising!\n\nAWARDS AND ACCOLADES\nThis is no ordinary game! Helsing's Fire is recognized around the world as one of the App Store's premier puzzle games; full of charm and challenge.\n\n IGF 2011 - Best Mobile Game Finalist\n IGF 2011 - Excellence in Design Honorable Mention\n IGF 2011 - Excellence in Visual Art Honorable Mention\n SlideToPlay - The 50 Best iPhone Games of 2010 (#7)\nTouchArcade - Best iPod Touch and iPhone Games (Puzzle)\n AppAdvice - The Very Best iPhone Games of 2010 (Puzzle)\n TheAppera - Best iPhone Games 2010\n TouchGen - Editor's Choice Awards (Puzzle Runner-up)\n\nPRESS QUOTES\n\nSlideToPlay\n... Helsing's Fire is one of those puzzle games that does something completely original and is unbelievably entertaining.\n\nEurogamer\n... With its insidious wit and gothic charm, Helsing's Fire is a joyously original instant classic that iPhone owners should buy immediately.\n\nTouchArcade\n... It's one of the most unique games I've ever played and is a true App Store gem. Surely only a creature of darkness would let this one slip by them.\n\nTheAppera\n... Helsing's Fire reinvents the puzzle yet again with some light and dark dynamics I guarantee you have NOT seen yet. Prepare to be enthralled!\n\nGamePro\n... This is a game that would absolutely only work on the iOS platform, and it's hands-down one of the best games on the App Store. It gets my highest recommendation.\n\nADDICTIVE PUZZLES\nHelsing's Fire features a brand-new puzzle mechanic never before seen: use the touch-screen to position Helsing's torch to illuminate different combinations of monsters, then destroy them in the correct order using Raffton's supply of different tonics. The quick, rewarding puzzles make it a perfect game for brief play-sessions, but you'll always want to play 'just one more level'!\n\nA HUGE, DARK UNIVERSE\nWith puzzles set across four worlds, with 30 different levels in each world, all featuring fifteen different monster types including four bosses, Helsing's Fire provides an incredibly\nrich, deep, and varied game experience. And because on replays puzzles are re-generated randomly, the game will always be fresh!\n\nCOMPELLING SETTING\nThe Victorian theme, Gothic setting, and engaging characters make Helsing's Fire one of the most appealing story-oriented puzzle games released. Add to that the distinct minimalist style of the character portraits, the incredible dynamic lighting of the shadows cast by your moving torch, and an original soundtrack, and it's clear that Helsing's Fire presents an epic experience. Designed just for the iPhone, this is high-quality mobile gaming at its finest.\n\nMULTIPLE MODES AND ACHIEVEMENTS\nAs if the 120 distinct levels weren't enough, Helsing's Fire also comes with additional Endless Survival and Online Bounty modes, for the bravest of the brave! And when you've stood against the horde as long as you can, you can post your scores on the fully-integrated Crystal leaderboards, earning achievements for your accomplishments and claiming bragging rights from your friends.\n\nDracula must be stopped. Raffton, take the tonics: it's time to head into the Blight!"

Get 40% off the original game and 33% off the extra story \"Blissful Sleep\"!\n\nWelcome to a grim dystopian future.\n\nA totalitarian State controls every aspect of private and public life. Laws are oppressive. Surveillance is total. Privacy is dead. You are the State-installed manager of an apartment building. Your daily routine involves making the building a sweet spot for tenants, who will come and go.\n \nHowever, that is simply a facade that hides your real mission.\n \nThe State has appointed you to SPY ON YOUR TENANTS! Your primary task is to covertly watch your tenants and eavesdrop on their conversations.

You must also REPORT anyone capable of violating the laws or plotting subversive activities against the State to the authorities.\n \nBeholder is all about making choices - choices that matter!\nWhat will you do with the information you collect? Will you report the suspicious activities of a father and orphan his children? Or will you withhold the details about his illegal activities and give him a chance to make things right?

Your goal is to fulfill your dream, create passive income and accumulate enough savings. \n\nYou can also develop as a person and find a life/work balance. Start a family. Get rid of bad habits. Avoid common money mistakes. Stop wasting. Help your parents. Do sports. Give to charity. But don't delay, you need to win before your retirement! \n\nSince it's impossible to do everything, you need to learn how to invest your time the same way you invest your money. Study time management and plan your time carefully, choose what's important and what's not. \n\nTimeflow is based on popular business simulators like Monopoly, Cashflow, Life, Payday, and the Tycoon series. It's also based on books by authors Robert Kiyosaki, Steven Covey, and Bryan Tracy.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

It is a metaphorical game filled with illusions and hidden messages.\n\nIn the world of OVIVO, Black and White exist in harmony. By constantly intertwining and replacing each other, they maintain balance. The main character named OVO was born of these two halves and has the ability to switch between them. OVO travels through the metaphorical world, overcoming dangers and collecting mysterious symbols. These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.\n\nFeatures:\n■\tFlow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black—upward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being carried by a flow.\n\n■\tFascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions.\n\n■\tDesign without words. There is almost no text in the game and the story is told through gameplay and visuals.\n\n■\tMeditative ambient soundtrack by Brokenkites."

You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****"

Only a few people managed to survive in that deadly attack that hit the planet from the space, but after a short time a new catastrophe started to threaten the survivors. And the main character, the Chosen of the North-216 Community, will have to deal with it. \n\nWorld of the post-apocalypse. First person shooter for survival.\n\nThe Sun Origin: Post-apocalyptic action — is a first-person shooter with RPG elements with its own history, hundreds of tasks, a huge arsenal of weapons and armor, trade, fighting factions, mutants, bandits and prowlers. Explore the world with a huge number of locations, buy the best weapons from the merchants and improve them. You will need only the best equipment! After all, your main goal is to save your Community from hunger. And let the struggle for survival begin!!!\n\nBrief background.\n\nIn the year 2050, the sun unleashed a catastrophic surge of energy into space, a wave of power that would plunge our civilization into chaos for centuries. Though predicted for years by the scientific community, their warnings were ignored by the world leaders that instead squabbled over petty territorial concerns.\n\nWhen the wave of energy struck the earth, a storm of radioactive particles blanketed the atmosphere in a deadly, carcinogenic fog. The fog killed indiscriminately… the young, old, rich and poor all fell in equal measure. Only those that had heeded the warnings and taken shelter in abandoned bunkers were spared. \n\nWhen their supplies eventually ran out and these communities were forced to emerge from their shelters, they saw a new world of desolation and chaos. A world in which the laws of civilization had been replaced by the law of the gun. The few areas that still had clean water and arable land were held by ruthless warlords and their armies.\n\nIt was in this world that a warrior known only as Raven would emerge. A warrior that would save his people by bending the wasteland to his will. A warrior that would one day become a legend.\n\nIt's a challenge! The world of the apocalypse or you?"

      "label": "“[A] surprising iPhone and Apple Watch bestseller is pushing the boundaries of fiction” - boingboing.net\n“This is the best game on the Apple Watch” - Time.com\n\nLifeline is a playable, branching story of survival against all odds. Using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, you will help Taylor make life or death decisions, and face the consequences together.\n\nAcclaimed writer Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) weaves a gripping interactive story through the aftermath of a crash landing on an alien moon. Taylor is stranded, the rest of the crew are dead or missing, and Taylor’s communicator can only reach you.\n\nLifeline pioneered a new narrative experience enabled by modern devices. This story plays out in real time as Taylor works to stay alive, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Taylor directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.\n\nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and see what happens when you make a different choice. Simple actions can have a profound effect. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n\nLifeline is a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes. Taylor is relying on YOU.\n\nYou can play Lifeline in any of these languages:\n- English\n- French\n- German\n- Russian\n- Simplified Chinese\n- Japanese\n- Spanish\n- Korean\n\nNEW in version 1.8: Stick around after the game for a special story epilogue from Dave Justus. For players who have already finished the game, the Bonus Story becomes available under the game options. Witness the events leading up to Lifeline: Silent Night.\n\nInternet connection not required. No in-app purchases and no ads.\n\n\nPraise for Lifeline:\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“I felt an immediate attachment to a fictional character pinging me from a strange galaxy to my wearable.” - Luke Hopewell, Gizmodo Australia\n\n“[P]laying it on the Apple Watch makes you truly feel like you’re exchanging messages with an astronaut via a futuristic transmitter.” - Michael Andronico, Tom’s Guide\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\n\nLifeline was created by:\nDave Justus\nMars Jokela\nDan Selleck\nColin Liotta\nJason Nowak\nBen “Books” Schwartz"

      "label": "Based on simple rules and minimalist features, Traffix will amaze you in no time! \nThe highway is a place where chaos, stress and rage are always present, mainly in big cities like Paris, Tokyo, Istanbul or Las Vegas. Aware of this, you must control the traffic light to keep the drivers safe and maintain peace. \nStart fighting chaos all over the world! \n\nFeatures:\nSimple rules: Tap the traffic light on the right time to change its color and manage the highway. It works just as a normal traffic light with green, yellow and red colors. \nMinimalist: You will find cars, a bus or a van in almost every city. There are cities featuring a truck, a train and even a plane. Your job? Make sure they don’t crash. \nCalming: Traffix will not force you to think too hard. Each new city will amaze your senses and help you to relax. \nTricky levels: The visual features of Traffix are very simple and minimalist, but some cities can turn very tricky! The slightest distraction can cause a big crash.\n\nEverybody hates traffic. Even when it is minimalist, like on Traffix. \nNow there is a way to control chaos and spread some peace to the streets.\nOn Traffix you are the highway manager. Each city will deliver a different dose of stress and chaos. By tapping the traffic lights on the right time, you can control the flow and avoid raging drivers.\n\nIt’s very important that you do not make drivers wait or they will get mad. \nOn the other side, do not rush or they will crash!\nYou have to wait for the right time to tap the traffic lights and guide the cars to their destination.\n\nThe lights are red by default. Wait for the right time to turn the yellow light on and let one car go. When the road is empty, double tap to activate the green traffic light!\nYou will quickly understand how Traffix works, thanks to the minimalist and evocative elements. \n\nThe rules are simple:\nRed: All the vehicles will stop. The red traffic light will get everybody angry after a while. \nYellow: It will allow one car to pass. After that, becomes automatically red. The yellow traffic light is the safest play. \nGreen: Tap twice to make the light turn green. This will open the traffic light and allow all the cars to advance. Most of the accidents occur within the green traffic light.\n\nChaos Mode:\nThere is a second game mode available. The Chaos Mode is just for pros and it will amaze you by its simplicity. As you understand by its name, it features extra stress and madness. \nYou need to guide the police cars to their destination safely. One crash and you lose.\nDo you think you can complete all the cities? This is your time to prove it. \n\nPlay all over the world!\nTraffix features the busiest cities in the world. Places where stress is rooted and peace is a distant mirage. As you progress, the highway will get more and more chaotic. \nOn that point, one of two things will happen: or you overcome the challenges or you become one of the raging drivers. \n\nSee you on the highway!"

Rare subject, stunning graphics, realistic physics, fish behavior system, wide selection of fishing gear, different game modes in the various locations around the world, changing season, day time and weather conditions that also affect fish behavior makes Ice Lakes the ultimate ice fishing simulator.\n\nKey Features:\n\n- 21 open world maps \n- 32 fish species \n- 18 competition modes \n- 18 tournaments \n- Extensive statistics about everything \n- Character customization \n- Rod movement with or without inertia sensors\n- Fish fights\n- Changing weather and time of day (Morning, Noon, Evening and Night) \n- Change of seasons (fall, winter, spring) \n- Fish behavior engine. A fish AI and swarm system controlling each species \n- Fishing equipment. Learn and master the use of dozens of jigs, rods, augers, baits and lures\n- Encyclopedia about fish species and ice fishing in general\n\n\nGame description\n\nIn this game you can roam freely in the beautiful open world maps and explore river, pond and lake locations in diverse environments. Dare to go deeper into the wild where no fisherman has gone before and find the biggest catches.\n\nFinding the best fishing spots by learning the depth maps and bottom topology of each location is fun, but requires patience and dedication. Nothing wins the expectation of finding the best location or catching the biggest fish from each lake. \n\nThe real excitement starts when it is time to throw fishing lines into the water and start fishing! The right equipment for right conditions are as essential as is mastering the location. The realistic fish behavior system, fish AI and fish swarms for over 30 fish species makes this game a lifelike fishing experience. Fishing gear can be chosen from a wide selection of different jigs, rods, augers and baits. A perfect combination of equipment for different species depends on the season, but especially weather and daytime conditions. Controlling a rod and a jig in the water in a right way and at the right depth in Ice Lakes is a skill of its own. Rod and jig physics guarantees that fish react authentically to player's actions. \n\nFishing independently without time limits or competitors makes Ice Lakes a relaxing game to play and tune your fishing skills in the comfort of your home. On the other hand, lengthy tournaments and very customizable single competitions will test the player's skills and knowledge, but will reward them with new equipment and limitless fame."

      "label": "SmoothTrack uses the AR capabilities of your phone to provide the simplest and best head tracker for 6 degrees-of-freedom head movements in your sim games.\n\nANY iOS 13 DEVICE IS SUPPORTED!\n\n----\n\"The best new controller on the market will only set you back $9.99. It's a smartphone app called SmoothTrack.\" - Polygon\n\nCustomer reviews:\n\n\"SmoothTrack just works. Less than 5 minutes to install, setup and fly. Love not being tethered to my desk! 5 stars!!\"\n\"This worked perfectly and way better than expected! Totally enhanced my experience with MFS 2020!\"\n---\n\nIt's a near magical experience to seamlessly slightly move your head and have your game perspective immediately play along (the movements in the game are exaggerated so that you only have to make slight movements of your head to control the camera).\n\n - Simply lean forward to get a closer look at your Flight Simulator cockpit!\n - Look a bit up to see the overhead panel of your A320!\n - Simply shift your head a bit to the right to see the direction of the space station you're approaching in Elite: Dangerous!\n - Look a bit left before a hard left turn in Euro Truck Simulator 2!\n\n\nNo headset or extra equipment of any kind is required! Simply set up your device so that it can see your face. Using the on-screen controls, you can shift your perspective in-game.\n\nYour head movements are slightly exaggerated which enables you to look out of a cockpit side window with just a slight movement of your head to the left.\n\nAny game that supports the FreeTrack or TrackIR protocol will work with this, including:\n\n- Microsoft Flight Simulator\n- Microsoft FSX\n- DCS World\n- Elite: Dangerous\n- IL2: Sturmovik\n- Euro Truck Simulator 2\n- Kerbal Space Program\n- ...and many, many others!\n\nINSTRUCTIONS (included in the app):\n\n    1. On your computer, install and run the latest version of the free program \"OpenTrack\". It is available on GitHub at http://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/releases\n    2. In OpenTrack, as \"Input source\", choose \"UDP over network\". As Output, choose \"Freetrack 2.0 Enhanced\", as its sub-type \"Both\".\n    3. Make sure the UDP port OpenTrack is using is open both on your firewall and router.\n    4. Find the IP address of your PC by running 'ipconfig' in a Command Line - look for \"IPv4 Address\".\n    5. Now, in SmoothTrack, set up your IP address and port in the settings\n    6. Press \"Start\" in OpenTrack\n    7. Tap Play here in SmoothTrack and you should see the OpenTrack octopus move around, which means any game that supports TrackIR will now be supporting your head tracking! If the octopus is not moving, then check Troubleshooting for more detailed instructions.\n\nEmail support is provided if there are any issues (or if you have any ideas for new features!)."

Flick dice to fire them across the screen when the numbers don’t go your way.\n\nCreate custom dice with any text or emoji on the faces, or import your own images, and easily share your dice with friends.\n\nSupports split screen and slide-over on the iPad, so you can put it alongside your other RPG apps, and speech synthesis that can read out the list of dice and the results. Also comes with a companion Apple Watch app, so you'll never be without a D20 again. Even supports AR!\n\nThe ideal app for every member of your party!"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

You can use LYNE instead of your real number when you need to use a phone number for the date, work, online shopping, or selling, etc.\n\n\nAbout 2ndLine:\n\nIf you have any question or feedback, please contact us with the Support feature in our apps or email us at support@2ndlyne.com\n\n\n>> 2ndLine offers a subscription plan for your premium numbers.\n\n\n- Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription.\n- Your account will be charged for a renewed subscription within 24 hours before the end of the current subscription.\n- Your account will auto-renew once a month, every 3 months or once a year depending on the subscription period you choose.\n- The subscription price ranges from $5.99/wk, $9.99/mo & $69.99/yr and will vary depending on the type you pick but will be shown before you confirm the purchase.\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- You can manage your subscription and switch off the auto-renewal by accessing your account settings after purchase.\n- You cannot cancel the current subscription during the active subscription period.\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://2ndlyne.com/privacy-policy.html\nTerms of Use: https://2ndlyne.com/terms-of-use.html"

It provides the same user- friendly experience that’s earned BBM millions of fans worldwide – with the end-to-end security enterprise needs. \n\nBBM Enterprise allows users to take advantage of the speed, reliability and privacy of BBM for faster communication, collaboration and decision making while providing security conscious organizations enhanced security over corporate data.\nBBM Enterprise is the ideal business communication tool because it is mobile and immediate. Unlike enterprise IM tools that were originally designed for use on the desktop, BBM Enterprise offers a truly mobile experience, on a variety of devices.\nWith BBM Enterprise, you only need one app to cover your mobile messaging and collaboration needs. Users know when their colleagues have received and read messages, so they can collaborate with confidence, in real-time. One-to-one chats, group discussions and file sharing all happen with the protection required by security-focused organizations – and all with an immediacy and accountability that’s hard to achieve through any other communication channel. \n\nBBM Enterprise uses a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic library and leverages BlackBerry’s secure infrastructure, trusted by security-conscious and regulated organizations around the world, to protect data while it’s in transit and at rest.  All the added security offered by BBM Enterprise happens in the background, so there’s no impact on the BBM user experience.\n\n\nTo use BBM Enterprise for personal use, you can buy an auto-renewable subscription from within the app. The BBM Enterprise auto-renewable subscription provides access to use the app for enhanced secure communication for 6 months with a 1 year free trial.  Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the end of the free trial period. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store account settings after purchase.\nTerms of Service: https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/legal/blackberry-messenger"

The free GoToWebinar mobile app lets you not only see and hear webinars, but take part in them as well. No matter where you are, you can ask questions, take part in polls and more. If you’re running the webinar, you can present directly from your iPad, share your iPad’s webcam and chat with other event staff.\n\nFEATURES\n\nFor Attendees\nAttend and participate in online events while you’re on the move.\n   •  Join easily by tapping the online event link in an invite email or your calendar.\n   •  Use a single tap to dial in to the phone conference or connect to audio using WiFi or 4G/3G.\n   •  View the event speaker’s slide presentations up close.\n   •  Participate in polls, raise your hand and ask the event speaker a question.\n   •  View up to 6 webcams on any iOS device. \n\nFor Organizers\nIn addition to the above, as an organizer you can\n   • Schedule Webinars\n   • View previously scheduled Webinars\n   • View the number of registrants for an upcoming Webinar\n   • Share a Webinar registration link via email, SMS, twitter, facebook and more.\n\nFor Panelists\nIn addition to the above, as a panelist you can use your iPad to\n   • Share your webcam\n   • Share a document from your favorite cloud storage app\n   • Chat with other panelists and organizers\n\nHOW TO JOIN AN EVENT\nThere is no purchase necessary to attend a GoToWebinar event. Two easy ways to join:\n   • Tap an event link in the invite email or your calendar.\n   • Tap the GoToWebinar icon after you download the app and enter the session ID.\nNOTE: Presenter controls can be passed to anyone in the event if they have content to share. If you’re using an iPad, you can access and present content stored on cloud services.\n\nAUDIO\n   • Upon joining an event, you will automatically connect to audio through your Internet connection (WiFi or 4G/3G).\n   • For the best audio experience, plug a headset into your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.\n   • If you prefer to dial in over your phone line, you can do that with a single tap after joining the event. \n   • If you are attending the event in person, easily disconnect from audio any time so you can continue to participate in polls and see the speaker’s presentation up close.\nNOTE: Due to network constraints, iPhone users on the Verizon network will be unable to join the event and dial in over the phone at the same time.\n\nVIDEO CONFERENCING\nIf additional presenters are using webcams, you will automatically see them upon joining the event. \n   • GoToWebinar presenters can turn on webcams by tapping the webcam icon then the Share My Webcam button.\n   • While it is possible to stream video over a 4G/3G connection, WiFi is recommended to avoid charges with your network carrier."

Simple, easy, focused and fun.\n\nI made this app as a prototype for a larger app I was working on, to my delight my kids LOVED it. They use this whenever they want to draw instead of the other drawing apps we already had.\n\nI think they love it so much because there's no extra stuff to get in the way, they can just be totally immersed in drawing.\n\nSo I decided to release it to the App Store and let others try it out too. I appreciate your support.\n\nFeatures:\n* Draw anything you want with the colors of the rainbow.\n* Draw together with friends and family using the Messages app. Just send a drawing to a friend and they can open it and draw on it too and then send it back.\n* 6 convenient preconfigured marker sizes\n* Undo, Redo, and Clear drawing actions\n* Special \"Rainbow\" marker lets you draw with a rainbow!!! you gotta try it!\n* Change the background color by long pressing on one of the colors\n* Remembers your last used marker color and size and your canvas color.\n* Import photos to trace, annotate, and have fun with\n* Shake to erase\n* Save your drawings to your Photos library\n* Print your drawings to AirPrint enabled printers\n* Share your drawings with Messages, Mail, and many more\n* Tip Jar allows you to provide financial support to further development of Whiteboard.\n\nWhiteboard Labs Features (early stage features you can opt-in to try)\n* Draw with Knobs - draw pictures using knobs the old school way!\n* Screen Recording - record the screen and audio as you draw, save or send the recording to friends and family.\n* Infinite Canvas - add more pages to your canvas as you draw\n* Draw with Motion - tilt your device to draw a picture\n\nMy goal is to make the funnest and easiest to use drawing app for kids. I improve Whiteboard with your reviews, feedback, and financial support. If you or someone you know, enjoys using Whiteboard:\n\n• Please leave a tip in the Tip Jar\n• Please rate the app 5 stars so more people find it\n• Please share Whiteboard with a friend or family member to help get the word out.\n• Please send me an email and let me know how you're using Whiteboard, send me drawings, questions, concerns and feedback.\n• Please send me your Whiteboard drawings on Instagram @getwhiteboard.\n\n- Jim"

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly.

      "label": "With JOBSEEQR, we ditched the old-fashioned send-your-cv-via-email method of applying for a job and developed a first-of-its-kind job search platform that successfully created a user-friendly space for job seekers and employers to discuss employment more freely than ever before, doing so via messaging and video chat. With thousands of users on JOBSEEQR already, along with a several hundred employments, we can help you find just what you're looking for, be it the right job opportunity or the most suitable employee.\n\nFrom real-time messaging to video chat for interviews, JOBSEEQR presents you with the next-level features you deserve on a job search platform, making the online hiring process easier than previously possible, especially when it comes to remote jobs. We believe the features we provide will definitely make the decision-making process for employers when it comes to employing an individual a lot more efficient, as there’s more to an individual than just their CV, thus also promoting fairness in favor of the job seeker in question. \n\nJOBSEEQR was first created as a result of the ongoing dire economic situation in Lebanon. As we watched the unemployment rate in the country hit all-time highs, we wanted to do something about it, but we also didn’t want to build a basic platform that has many similarities with other platforms of the kind, hence failing to offer users with real value and showing a lack of commitment to the cause from our part. We can proudly say that through JOBSEEQR we’ve changed the lives of many many individuals for the better, as well as helping dozens of companies across Lebanon find employees they’ve been longing to have. We hope to continue to make a difference in people’s lives while we also continue our quest towards revolutionizing online job search platforms for the better.\n\nJOBSEEQR FEATURES:\n\nAS A JOB SEEKER, YOU CAN:\n1) Browse available job posts posted by employers\n2) Be matched to job posts that match your desired job\n3) Build your professional profile, with the ability to upload your CV for employers to see\n4) Chat with employers regarding job posts that interest you\n5) Receive messages from employers who believe you're a suitable candidate\n6) Get interviewed virtually by employers via video chat\n\nAS FOR EMPLOYERS, YOU CAN:\n1) Post new job posts and edit existing ones\n2) Add a public profile for job seekers to know who you are\n3) Browse all job seekers on the platform and filter them by desired job\n4) Get in touch with job seekers who you consider to be potential candidates for your company\n5) Evaluate job seekers by studying their profile (CV included)\n6) Ask follow-up questions with ease via messaging\n7) Conduct video chat interviews with potential candidates\n\nMake sure you follow us on Instagram (@jobseeqr) for all the latest news and announcements, and please feel free to inform us of any inquiries or concerns you may have.\n\nYour data on JOBSEEQR is completely safe with us, with no third-party entities having access to any of it.

Which apps can you use? It depends on what’s been created for you. Here are some examples you might see, or ones you can make yourself using the Power Apps website:\r\n\r\n• Campus app: Map your campus with icons for landmarks and facility details.\r\n• Event registration app: Record attendees as they arrive using barcodes or QR codes.\r\n• Expenses app: Let employees submit their expenses and upload photos of receipts.\r\n• Health clinic app: Let patients check in to appointments with just a few taps.\r\n• NFC reader app: Scan NFC tags on ID cards, equipment, packages, etc.\r\n• Performance app: Visualize data and get insights with interactive dashboards.\r\n• Sales app: See opportunities and leads, review comments, and approve for your P&L.\r\n• Space planning app: Take 3D measurements and manipulate objects in mixed reality.\r\n• Timesheet app: Collect, consolidate, and analyze shift data from employees.\r\n\r\nThis is just a handful of examples; the possibilities are endless. Build and share low-code apps for your work or school at the Power Apps website.\r\n\r\nTIPS\r\n\r\n• Swipe right to make an app a favorite, swipe left to add a shortcut to the home screen.\r\n• As an admin, mark an app as Featured, so that it stays pinned to the top of the apps list.\r\n• Some apps can work offline, and Power Apps will sync your data when you reconnect.\r\n\r\nAccessibility: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2121429"

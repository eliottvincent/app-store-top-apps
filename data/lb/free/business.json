The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

With our 4,000+ partnered recruiters (among which BWN, Henkel, Zalando, Amazon, Deutsche Bahn to name a few…) it doesn’t matter if you are looking for an internship during your studies or a full time job right after you graduate: JobTeaser has your back.\n\nIt’s clear and very simple: create your professional profile in a few minutes, upload your CV and other relevant information (your best TikTok is not), and you’re all set. While recruiters are discovering your profile you can always browse through our job listings where you can apply on your own. We rank the 10 most relevant jobs to your specific profile so that you don’t have to scroll for hours!\n\nRecruiters will then see your profile when they are looking to recruit for a specific job, and \nthey’ll send you the job description if they think you’d be a good fit for it (we just heard you screaming \"That is so lit!\", don't pretend you didn't).\n\nThe next steps are up to you! Let them know what you think. If you are interested in the job, they’ll get full access to your CV and will contact you to get the process started. If not, then you won’t hear from them again.\n(But you'll probably keep hearing from us, we're not into one-download stands)\n\nWe're here for you, anytime. Please don't hesitate to reach us out in case of need, and to rate our app!"

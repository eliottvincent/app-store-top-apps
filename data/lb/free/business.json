During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

Whova is one of the most widely used mobile apps by professionals for networking at conferences, trade shows, expos, summits, conventions, business meetings, corporate events, association events, and community gatherings. Whova, the Mobile Event App, has received the Event Technology Awards for five years in a row (2016-2021). \n\nWatch this PREVIEW VIDEO to see how Whova can help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IKTYK8ZS9g\n\nWhat makes Whova special? Whova's technology builds comprehensive profiles of attendees so you can view all attendee profiles before you even arrive at the event or conference. Plan in advance whom to meet at an event, what to talk about with each attendee and reach out to others via in-app messages before, during and after the event. You can also create casual meetups and arrange social activities with other groups of attendees. Whova revolutionizes event networking and significantly improves the ROI of attending events.\n\nYou can also use the Whova conference app to digitize and manage business cards you receive at events. Whova exceeds other business card reader apps like CamCard, CardMunch, ScanBizCards or Scannable etc. by automatically building full profiles using Whova's SmartProfile technology. This allows you to gain deep insights into your contacts' professional backgrounds, work experience, passions, and interests. You can also seamlessly connect with contacts online via LinkedIn and other platforms. Whova's business card scanning feature now supports cards in English, Chinese, and Korean.\n\nWhova is SOC2 Type II and PCI compliant. These security and privacy certificates recognize Whova’s practice of reliable, safe, secure, and trustworthy management of user data protection and privacy.\n\nGet more out of events:\n\n- Never miss important updates: Get instant notifications from event organizers\n\n- Browse comprehensive professional profiles of all event attendees\n\n- Use the Community Board to self-organize social activities and gatherings, coordinate rideshares, break the ice, explore job opportunities, post questions and lost & found items, etc.\n\n- Scan and save business cards and gain deep insights into your contacts\n\n- Send in-app messages and schedule private meetings before and after events\n\n- Access the agenda, GPS guidance, interactive floor maps, parking directions, slides, and photos\n\n- Get involved in event activities through live polling, event gamification, Tweeting, photo sharing, group chatting, and mobile surveys\n\n- Conveniently explore exhibitors' information and get coupons/giveaways with one tap\n\nTestimonials:\n\n- “It makes networking much more effective at this event with 500+ attendees. We no longer have to wander around wondering if we will bump into the person we really would like to meet. “\n\n- “I could see who attended and easily follow up with the people after this entrepreneur/investor event”\n\n- “I have seen other event apps but neither of them provided such valuable information of the attendees. “\n\n- “This app has been fantastic for networking, announcements, agenda, etc., at this one-week conference!”\n\n- “Another great feature of the Whova app is the ability to share slides and documents electronically.”\n\n- \"Whova is an amazing app for keeping track of your connections and storing them in one easy-to-access place. I love the ability to connect with contacts via LinkedIn and the simplicity of emailing potential members.\"\n\nGet in touch:\n\nTo partner with Whova or simply to stay up-to-date with the latest news, please visit our website and follow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/whovasupport\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback!\nContact us at: support@whova.com\n\nAcknowledgements: Icons by Icons8"

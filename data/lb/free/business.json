The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

      "label": "With JOBSEEQR, we ditched the old-fashioned send-your-cv-via-email method of applying for a job and developed a first-of-its-kind job search platform that successfully created a user-friendly space for job seekers and employers to discuss employment more freely than ever before, doing so via messaging and video chat. With thousands of users on JOBSEEQR already, along with a several hundred employments, we can help you find just what you're looking for, be it the right job opportunity or the most suitable employee.\n\nFrom real-time messaging to video chat for interviews, JOBSEEQR presents you with the next-level features you deserve on a job search platform, making the online hiring process easier than previously possible, especially when it comes to remote jobs. We believe the features we provide will definitely make the decision-making process for employers when it comes to employing an individual a lot more efficient, as there’s more to an individual than just their CV, thus also promoting fairness in favor of the job seeker in question. \n\nJOBSEEQR was first created as a result of the ongoing dire economic situation in Lebanon. As we watched the unemployment rate in the country hit all-time highs, we wanted to do something about it, but we also didn’t want to build a basic platform that has many similarities with other platforms of the kind, hence failing to offer users with real value and showing a lack of commitment to the cause from our part. We can proudly say that through JOBSEEQR we’ve changed the lives of many many individuals for the better, as well as helping dozens of companies across Lebanon find employees they’ve been longing to have.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

      "label": "With JOBSEEQR, we ditched the old-fashioned send-your-cv-via-email method of applying for a job and developed a first-of-its-kind job search platform that successfully created a user-friendly space for job seekers and employers to discuss employment more freely than ever before, doing so via messaging and video chat. With thousands of users on JOBSEEQR already, along with a several hundred employments, we can help you find just what you're looking for, be it the right job opportunity or the most suitable employee.\n\nFrom real-time messaging to video chat for interviews, JOBSEEQR presents you with the next-level features you deserve on a job search platform, making the online hiring process easier than previously possible, especially when it comes to remote jobs. We believe the features we provide will definitely make the decision-making process for employers when it comes to employing an individual a lot more efficient, as there’s more to an individual than just their CV, thus also promoting fairness in favor of the job seeker in question. \n\nJOBSEEQR was first created as a result of the ongoing dire economic situation in Lebanon. As we watched the unemployment rate in the country hit all-time highs, we wanted to do something about it, but we also didn’t want to build a basic platform that has many similarities with other platforms of the kind, hence failing to offer users with real value and showing a lack of commitment to the cause from our part. We can proudly say that through JOBSEEQR we’ve changed the lives of many many individuals for the better, as well as helping dozens of companies across Lebanon find employees they’ve been longing to have. We hope to continue to make a difference in people’s lives while we also continue our quest towards revolutionizing online job search platforms for the better.\n\nJOBSEEQR FEATURES:\n\nAS A JOB SEEKER, YOU CAN:\n1) Browse available job posts posted by employers\n2) Be matched to job posts that match your desired job\n3) Build your professional profile, with the ability to upload your CV for employers to see\n4) Chat with employers regarding job posts that interest you\n5) Receive messages from employers who believe you're a suitable candidate\n6) Get interviewed virtually by employers via video chat\n\nAS FOR EMPLOYERS, YOU CAN:\n1) Post new job posts and edit existing ones\n2) Add a public profile for job seekers to know who you are\n3) Browse all job seekers on the platform and filter them by desired job\n4) Get in touch with job seekers who you consider to be potential candidates for your company\n5) Evaluate job seekers by studying their profile (CV included)\n6) Ask follow-up questions with ease via messaging\n7) Conduct video chat interviews with potential candidates\n\nMake sure you follow us on Instagram (@jobseeqr) for all the latest news and announcements, and please feel free to inform us of any inquiries or concerns you may have.\n\nYour data on JOBSEEQR is completely safe with us, with no third-party entities having access to any of it.

Use that code along with your username and password.\n•        Receive a push notification on your mobile device that you approve as authentication. If your organization requires you to define an additional device authentication mechanism to meet the security requirements, you will be prompted for the additional local authentication such as passphrases or biometrics.\n•        Use Touch ID, Face ID, or Passcode in a push notification to authenticate yourself on your mobile device.\nNote: Touch ID or Face ID authentication requires that your mobile device is Touch ID or Face ID capable and that you have registered a fingerprint or facial recognition authentication on the device.\n\nThe strong authentication method you use depends on the method implemented by your participating organization.\n\nYou can generate a security code even if you do not have a network or mobile connection.\n\nQR/App Codes\n\nScan a QR Code at participating organizations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and more to generate a security code every 30 seconds to securely sign in. Enter this security code along with your password to add strong authentication to your favorite websites.\n\nBe sure to read the VIP End User Agreement after downloading VIP Access: https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/end-user-agreement-english"

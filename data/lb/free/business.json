The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

With thousands of users on JOBSEEQR already, along with a several hundred employments, we can help you find just what you're looking for, be it the right job opportunity or the most suitable employee.\n\nFrom real-time messaging to video chat for interviews, JOBSEEQR presents you with the next-level features you deserve on a job search platform, making the online hiring process easier than previously possible, especially when it comes to remote jobs. We believe the features we provide will definitely make the decision-making process for employers when it comes to employing an individual a lot more efficient, as there’s more to an individual than just their CV, thus also promoting fairness in favor of the job seeker in question. \n\nJOBSEEQR was first created as a result of the ongoing dire economic situation in Lebanon. As we watched the unemployment rate in the country hit all-time highs, we wanted to do something about it, but we also didn’t want to build a basic platform that has many similarities with other platforms of the kind, hence failing to offer users with real value and showing a lack of commitment to the cause from our part. We can proudly say that through JOBSEEQR we’ve changed the lives of many many individuals for the better, as well as helping dozens of companies across Lebanon find employees they’ve been longing to have. We hope to continue to make a difference in people’s lives while we also continue our quest towards revolutionizing online job search platforms for the better.\n\nJOBSEEQR FEATURES:\n\nAS A JOB SEEKER, YOU CAN:\n1) Browse available job posts posted by employers\n2) Be matched to job posts that match your desired job\n3) Build your professional profile, with the ability to upload your CV for employers to see\n4) Chat with employers regarding job posts that interest you\n5) Receive messages from employers who believe you're a suitable candidate\n6) Get interviewed virtually by employers via video chat\n\nAS FOR EMPLOYERS, YOU CAN:\n1) Post new job posts and edit existing ones\n2) Add a public profile for job seekers to know who you are\n3) Browse all job seekers on the platform and filter them by desired job\n4) Get in touch with job seekers who you consider to be potential candidates for your company\n5) Evaluate job seekers by studying their profile (CV included)\n6) Ask follow-up questions with ease via messaging\n7) Conduct video chat interviews with potential candidates\n\nMake sure you follow us on Instagram (@jobseeqr) for all the latest news and announcements, and please feel free to inform us of any inquiries or concerns you may have.\n\nYour data on JOBSEEQR is completely safe with us, with no third-party entities having access to any of it.

      "label": "Being away from your computer doesn’t mean you have to miss out on online events. The free GoToWebinar mobile app lets you not only see and hear webinars, but take part in them as well. No matter where you are, you can ask questions, take part in polls and more. If you’re running the webinar, you can present directly from your iPad, share your iPad’s webcam and chat with other event staff.\n\nFEATURES\n\nFor Attendees\nAttend and participate in online events while you’re on the move.\n   •  Join easily by tapping the online event link in an invite email or your calendar.\n   •  Use a single tap to dial in to the phone conference or connect to audio using WiFi or 4G/3G.\n   •  View the event speaker’s slide presentations up close.\n   •  Participate in polls, raise your hand and ask the event speaker a question.\n   •  View up to 6 webcams on any iOS device. \n\nFor Organizers\nIn addition to the above, as an organizer you can\n   • Schedule Webinars\n   • View previously scheduled Webinars\n   • View the number of registrants for an upcoming Webinar\n   • Share a Webinar registration link via email, SMS, twitter, facebook and more.\n\nFor Panelists\nIn addition to the above, as a panelist you can use your iPad to\n   • Share your webcam\n   • Share a document from your favorite cloud storage app\n   • Chat with other panelists and organizers\n\nHOW TO JOIN AN EVENT\nThere is no purchase necessary to attend a GoToWebinar event. Two easy ways to join:\n   • Tap an event link in the invite email or your calendar.\n   • Tap the GoToWebinar icon after you download the app and enter the session ID.\nNOTE: Presenter controls can be passed to anyone in the event if they have content to share. If you’re using an iPad, you can access and present content stored on cloud services.\n\nAUDIO\n   • Upon joining an event, you will automatically connect to audio through your Internet connection (WiFi or 4G/3G).\n   • For the best audio experience, plug a headset into your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.\n   • If you prefer to dial in over your phone line, you can do that with a single tap after joining the event. \n   • If you are attending the event in person, easily disconnect from audio any time so you can continue to participate in polls and see the speaker’s presentation up close.\nNOTE: Due to network constraints, iPhone users on the Verizon network will be unable to join the event and dial in over the phone at the same time.\n\nVIDEO CONFERENCING\nIf additional presenters are using webcams, you will automatically see them upon joining the event. \n   • GoToWebinar presenters can turn on webcams by tapping the webcam icon then the Share My Webcam button.\n   • While it is possible to stream video over a 4G/3G connection, WiFi is recommended to avoid charges with your network carrier."

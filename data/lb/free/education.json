In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain.

To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy.

      "label": "From the award-winning team at Mrs Wordsmith comes Word Tag: A brand new, epic word game so engaging, your child won’t want to stop learning!\n\n\r\nCombining cutting-edge design, educational research and compelling gameplay, Word Tag will help your child improve their vocabulary and become a confident reader in just 20 minutes per day. Using a tried-and-tested framework, Word Tag uses fun minigames to give kids the eight exposures they need to retain vocabulary, in bite-sized chunks, over the course of three weeks. \r\n\r\nWe collaborated with the team behind the wildly fun Subway Surfers game to make vocabulary learning into just as exciting a ride. \r\n\r\nBut though it might look like play, it’s actually learning! We brought in literacy experts to help produce our unique pedagogical approach, including Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory. \r\n\r\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across three different games: \r\n\r\n-Wild Styling: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word. It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\r\n-Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\r\n-Pop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz!\r\n\r\nThe order of the minigames in Word Tag is carefully scaffolded, with each minigame building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning. \r\n\r\nThe truth is that you don’t have to choose between game-first design and educational value. The same elements that make sure kids want to play also make sure that they learn more effectively. \r\n\r\n_______________________\r\n\r\nWhat vocabulary will kids see in Word Tag? Word lists are tailored to their needs, including:\r\n-Creative writing and literature words\r\n-Textbook words from the Lexile database\r\n-US exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\r\n-UK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\r\n-Inspirational words\r\n-STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\r\n\r\nThe game uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nDON’T WORRY:\r\n-No third-party ads, no in-app purchases\r\n-Suitable for ages 7-13\n\nFor more details please read our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

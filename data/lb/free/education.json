We will continue in the hopes that there will soon be peace for our children and children all around the world!\n\nDrawing Academy from Bini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) is a unique app where kids are inspired to learn by drawing. In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy. Just download and go!\n\nA free 7-day trial period is available to you, or you can subscribe right after download.\n\nAfter your free trial, your subscription will automatically start unless you adjust your subscription settings at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\nWe provide different subscription options for your convenience: monthly and annual subscription.\n\nIf you change your mind at any point, cancellation is easy through your iTunes settings.\n\nPayment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nYour subscription automatically renews unless you turn the renewal feature off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n\nYou will be charged for renewal within 24 hours of the end of the current period.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription anytime through your Account Settings without any cancellation fees.\n\nYou can use your subscription on any device registered with your Apple ID.\n\nABOUT BINI GAMES \n\nBini Games (ex-Bini Bambini) was started in 2012 by four parents with experience in children's education.

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "The Center for Educational Research and Development (CRDP) is providing teachers, learners and parents in Lebanon with the digital version of the national textbooks and their relevant educational guides. This digital version includes all books for pre-university general education stages, from preschool to the third secondary - in all its sections - and for all subject matters.  This initiative falls in response to the plan of The Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) in Lebanon to facilitate distance learning opportunities for all Lebanese.\n\tCRDP developed this “CRDP ebooks” application to download the digital version of the national textbooks. It is free and available to all those who are interested in these books.  With the beginning of the current school year, learners can - just once - connect to the Internet to download all their textbooks via this application; each according to his/her grade, with a license to use throughout the school year without the need for a permanent connection to the Internet.\n\tWe hope that this step minimizes the challenges faced by teachers and learners at public primary, intermediate and secondary schools during the distance learning period; wishing that it becomes a part, even if limited, of the efforts that the public school deserves so that it could meet the aspirations and needs of the Lebanese.\n\nVersion 2.0.0 Update:\nWe are constantly working on improving the app based on the users’ feedback and questions. These updated contains many features\n\n· Global authentication: one MEHE account used for all systems, verification of users, and controls to synchronize info with CRDP system.\n\n· Resume Reading feature: This helpful feature lets you know the last page you had open in the book, when you were there last time, and clicking on it will take you right back to that page\n\n· bookmarks: Ability to add bookmarks on pages so the student/teacher can go back to bookmarked pages\n\n· List of contents for books: you can now discover the book by checking its content and view all chapters, sections and subsections and page number for each title.\n\n· Voice Recorder: This feature allows you to record and memorize voice memo.\n\n· Notes: This feature enables you to add many text notes in each page.\n\n· Draw or Highlight: This feature enables the user to take notes on the page by drawing or highlighting the text for later use.\n\n· Notification system: Allow CRDP to send you notification concerning any announcements (new book, news...)\n\nThe Center For Educational Research and Development (CRDP) developed a new updated version of the eBooks, with support from USAID’s QITABI 2.\n\n“This material is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nThe contents are the responsibility of QITABI 2 and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government."

Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n• 2019 PCMag Editors’ Choice\n• 2019 Tabby Awards Winner\n• 2019 Best Mobile App Awards: Best Designed App and Best Overall App\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next.

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain.

By using controls the user goes through the algorithm while observing its work.\n\nThe current version of the application covers the following basic computer algorithms and data structures: \n\n1. SORTING\n\nBubble sort,\nSelection sort,\nInsertion sort,\nMerge sort,\nHeap sort,\nQuick sort, \n\n2. BINARY SEARCH TREE\n\nPre-order traversal, \nIn-order traversal, \nPost-order traversal,\nBreadth-first traversals,\nInsertion a node into binary search tree, \nDeleting a node from binary search tree,\n\n3. HASH-TABLE (chaining technique)\n\nInserting data into a Hash-table, \nDeleting data from a Hash-table, \n\n4. GRAPH\n\nDepth-first search,\nBreadth-first search,\nMinimum Spanning Tree,\nDijkstra's algorithm,\nGraph Constructor\n\nThe visualization of the algorithms and data structures is accompanied by a piece of code that shows its implementations. There is a direct link between the code and the visualization. The full code of each algorithm can be found by the link to a third-party Internet resource. Although the given code is written in Java and Python, the explanation and visualization of the algorithms are in no way tied to a specific programming language.\n\nAlgorithms and Data Structures is designed for a wide range of users and does not require any programming skills to understand this or that algorithm. However, since the application focuses on algorithms, it lacks definitions of data structures (with which the algorithms operate). Therefore, before using Algorithms and Data Structures app, it is recommended to be acquainted with such data structures as an array, binary tree, binary search tree, linked list, hash table, stack, queue, graph, etc. Algorithms and Data Structures may also interest experienced programmers, as it enables users with quick and efficient revision of the above algorithms.\n\nThe advantage of Algorithms and Data Structures app in comparison to other numerous resources for learning algorithms (books, presentations and videos), is that it helps master the material with minimal waste of time since while the user is observing the visual effect at every step, he or she is being involved in the algorithm. There is no need to pause or rewind in order to comprehend the idea of a lecturer as it happens with video-content. The speed of advancement in the Algorithms and Data Structures training program depends on the pace of the user, and not on the speed of a video clip."

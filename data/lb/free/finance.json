      "label": "Get on the safe side: With the S-pushTAN app, you can get the practical and secure approval procedure of your Sparkasse on your iPhone or iPad. When banking online, use pushTAN, an advanced, mobile security procedure.\n\nIT'S THAT EASY\n• When banking online with iPhone, iPad or computer, place your payment orders and send them.\n• The S-pushTAN app always shows the details of the order. Just check the order data and release the order by swiping.\n• Usable for all orders with TAN release. Whether transfers, submitting or changing standing orders, securitie or service orders and much more.\n\nLET'S GO AFTER ACTIVATION BY YOUR SPARKASSE\nYou can start with the S-pushTAN app if you are registered for the pushTAN procedure and have got your personal registration letter.\n\n1 - Apply for the pushTAN procedure or switch from your previously used procedure at the online branch of your Sparkasse.\n2 - Download the S-pushTAN app to your iPhone or iPad for free.\n3 - As soon as you have received the registration letter from your Sparkasse, start setting up the S-pushTAN app. \n\nSAFETY\n• The S-pushTAN app communicates exclusively encrypted via tested interfaces and ensures secure data transfer according to German online banking requirements.\n• Access to S-pushTAN is protected by a password you have chosen and optionally by Touch ID or Face ID.\n• The app automatically locks after a short period of time, which means that your data is secured as much as possible even if the iPhone or iPad gets lost.\n• The German TÜV confirms these highest safety standards every year anew.\n\nWORTH TO KNOW\n• In order to be able to use pushTAN, you need an activation by your Sparkasse and a registration letter for the first setup.\n• In order to use the current version of the app, you need iOS from version 13 on your iPhone or iPad.\n• If your iPhone or iPad is jailbroken, S-pushTAN is not executable on it. The important high security standards for the mobile banking we offer cannot be guaranteed on manipulated devices.\n• Please do not deny S-pushTAN any of the requested permissions when setting it up, as these are necessary for the smooth functioning of the app.\n• You get the app for free, but its use can cause costs. Please note the given information of your Sparkasse.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe take the protection of your data very seriously. It is regulated in the privacy policy.

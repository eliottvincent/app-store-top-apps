      "label": "The Bitcoin.com Wallet, trusted by millions, is an easy-to-use, multichain, self-custodial crypto wallet that puts you in full control of all your crypto holdings.\n\nIt allows you to:\n\n- Buy Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), and select ERC-20 tokens quickly and easily via credit card, Apple Pay, and more.\n- Sell BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, and select ERC-20 tokens into your local currency (in select regions).\n- Send, receive, and swap between BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, USDT, USDC, and a huge range of ERC-20 tokens.\n- Access DeFi apps that enable use cases like earning interest on your crypto, borrowing and lending, participating in NFT marketplaces, synthetic assets, and more.\n\nOther key features include:\n\nSELF-CUSTODIAL\n\nYour cryptoassets are ultra-secure because only you can access them. Self-custodial means not even Bitcoin.com has access to your funds, and you can easily port your assets to another crypto wallet whenever you want. No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password. Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

Our payments keyboard lets you get paid in any messaging app. You can now spontaneously create custom invoices within chats - just add our ZiiBoard to your list of international keyboards in settings and switch keyboards when you're chatting with customers to type out an amount. Once you hit send, that amount becomes a clickable invoice that customers can tap to pay you in seconds. Use it on Whatsapp, Instagram, Messenger, and all messaging apps.\n\nWho said businesses can't extend fun into the payment process? Ziina makes finance delightful by giving you the option to add a personal touch to all your interactions on the app. Businesses can bring their own branding and generate personalized invoices any time a customer has to pay. Both business and personal users can add a GIF, note, or photo to the money they send. Money is social IRL. Why can't it be social online? Because getting paid is great. But getting paid with a GIF? Even better.\n\nZiina Payments LLC is licensed by the UAE department of economic development. Ziina Ltd is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) under registration number F00673.\n\nPrivacy and security is baked into Ziina's DNA. We are PCI-DSS compliant. You can safeguard your account with biometrics such as a face scan or fingerprint to provide an extra layer of security. Users also have the option to secure their accounts with 3DS technology, which layers on top of biometrics to provide an additional PIN code as an authentication step to access your account. This significantly reduces theft, misuse of cards and loss of funds.\n\nZiina offers real-time fraud monitoring and prevention, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. To ensure your money is safe, our internal engine instantly flags suspect transactions for further investigation and takes appropriate measures to block fraudulent users from using Ziina.\n\nWe also provide IRL payment solutions for small businesses and freelancers. Don't let anything hold you back from participating in your local town or city's next market or convention. Get paid in markets, pop-ups, and mobile stalls by setting a pre-fixed amount on your QR code and displaying it for customers to scan and pay you in seconds. Embed your QR code into an NFC chip so clients can tap to pay for a quicker, more seamless customer experience. Ziina is a POS in your pocket.\n\nKeep a pulse on your sales with our analytics report. Use it to track revenue and optimize your financials whenever you need.\n\nCreate an account and get verified in minutes, for free.

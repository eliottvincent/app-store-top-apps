When banking online, use pushTAN, an advanced, mobile security procedure.\n\nIT'S THAT EASY\n• When banking online with iPhone, iPad or computer, place your payment orders and send them.\n• The S-pushTAN app always shows the details of the order. Just check the order data and release the order by swiping.\n• Usable for all orders with TAN release. Whether transfers, submitting or changing standing orders, securitie or service orders and much more.\n\nLET'S GO AFTER ACTIVATION BY YOUR SPARKASSE\nYou can start with the S-pushTAN app if you are registered for the pushTAN procedure and have got your personal registration letter.\n\n1 - Apply for the pushTAN procedure or switch from your previously used procedure at the online branch of your Sparkasse.\n2 - Download the S-pushTAN app to your iPhone or iPad for free.\n3 - As soon as you have received the registration letter from your Sparkasse, start setting up the S-pushTAN app. \n\nSAFETY\n• The S-pushTAN app communicates exclusively encrypted via tested interfaces and ensures secure data transfer according to German online banking requirements.\n• Access to S-pushTAN is protected by a password you have chosen and optionally by Touch ID or Face ID.\n• The app automatically locks after a short period of time, which means that your data is secured as much as possible even if the iPhone or iPad gets lost.\n• The German TÜV confirms these highest safety standards every year anew.\n\nWORTH TO KNOW\n• In order to be able to use pushTAN, you need an activation by your Sparkasse and a registration letter for the first setup.\n• In order to use the current version of the app, you need iOS from version 13 on your iPhone or iPad.\n• If your iPhone or iPad is jailbroken, S-pushTAN is not executable on it. The important high security standards for the mobile banking we offer cannot be guaranteed on manipulated devices.\n• Please do not deny S-pushTAN any of the requested permissions when setting it up, as these are necessary for the smooth functioning of the app.\n• You get the app for free, but its use can cause costs. Please note the given information of your Sparkasse.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe take the protection of your data very seriously.

      "label": "The Bitcoin.com Wallet, trusted by millions, is an easy-to-use, multichain, self-custodial crypto wallet that puts you in full control of all your crypto holdings.\n\nIt allows you to:\n\n- Buy Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), and select ERC-20 tokens quickly and easily via credit card, Apple Pay, and more.\n- Sell BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, and select ERC-20 tokens into your local currency (in select regions).\n- Send, receive, and swap between BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX, USDT, USDC, and a huge range of ERC-20 tokens.\n- Access DeFi apps that enable use cases like earning interest on your crypto, borrowing and lending, participating in NFT marketplaces, synthetic assets, and more.\n\nOther key features include:\n\nSELF-CUSTODIAL\n\nYour cryptoassets are ultra-secure because only you can access them. Self-custodial means not even Bitcoin.com has access to your funds, and you can easily port your assets to another crypto wallet whenever you want. No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password. Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

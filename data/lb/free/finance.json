You’ll get a credit line reported to Equifax and Experian every month. Each on-time payment builds payment history, which helps your credit score! Whether you have a low credit score or no credit score, we make it easy and worry-free – no credit check required and it only takes a few minutes to apply.\n\nHow it works:\n1. We set up a credit account for you and report it as a $750 credit line.\n\n2. You make a purchase in the Kikoff store with that credit line, and you just pay back what you spend (our lowest + most popular payment amount is $5/month). We report those payments to the credit bureaus every month while your utilization rate stays low (like 8% low).\n\n3. You have the option to put your credit building on autopilot by turning on AutoPay – that’s right, no heavy lifting required from you after account setup.\n\nKikoff helps you build credit by establishing a payment history and maintaining a low utilization rate, all with no unexpected fees or interest."

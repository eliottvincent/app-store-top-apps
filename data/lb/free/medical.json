Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

The data is encrypted – if you have a passcode on your device – meaning it is secure should you lose the device.\n\n\n# Sharing\n\nThe measurements are directly added to the growth chart PDFs. You can email these PDFs, print them out (if you have an AirPrint enabled printer nearby) or share them with other means provided by iOS, such as storing into your Dropbox or box.com. You can do the same with a spreadsheet file containing all this kids on your device, or one file per kid. Finally, there is an export option so you can transfer all your data to a different device of yours or a colleague.\n\n\n# Units\n\nWhether you're used to the metric system and have all data available in centimeter and kilogram or whether you're in the US and using imperial units, Charts has got you covered. You can switch the units you want to use right from the keyboard and these units will be saved as your preferred units. You can also change units from a dedicated list when viewing your child's measurements.\n\n\n# Included Charts\n\nThe app currently includes 40 official growth charts from these institutions:\n\n• World Health Organization (WHO)\n-- 0 - 24 months (weight, length, head circumference and weight for length)\n-- 2 - 5 years (weight, height and weight for height)\n-- 5 - 10 years (weight)\n-- 5 - 19 years (height and BMI)\n\n• Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n-- 0 - 36 months (weight, height, head circumference and weight for length)\n-- 2 - 20 years (weight, height, BMI and weight for height)\n\n\n# Requirements\n\nTo run this app you will need a device running iOS version 7.0 or newer."

Research has shown that smaller, more frequent study sessions are the key to knowledge retention. In other words, taking short quizzes on the go is a much more effective means of exam preparation than reading page after page in a textbook.

Meet ECG Basics, your go to app to learn the concepts of this ever challenging subject.\n\nThis app is organised into various sections - starting from basic concepts moving towards more advanced topics.\n\nInitial sections introduces you to calculate rate, analysing rhythm, and cardiac axis. Also you will learn about the waves - how they are generated and their morphology. \n\nSubsequent sections are organised in to topic wise not limiting to rhythm disturbances, bundle branch blocks, conduction disturbances, cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias, stress testing (TMT), Pediatric ECG, Pacemaker ECGs, electrolyte disturbances.\n\nThis app sort of works like an ECG atlas so that you can refer to specific electrocardiogram in emergency. \n\nElectrocardiography and electrocardiogram interpretation is must for any cardiologist and this topic is to be mastered in cardiology.\n\nThe free version does not include some chapters (which are not very essential, but more important to someone looking for advanced learning) and it contains ads. Purchase the pro version to gain mastery over electrocardiography.\n\nThis app is most useful for people looking for basic concepts (consider it as ECG for dummies) like medical students, paramedical staff, nurses, physiotherapists. But people who already mastered electrocardiography can also have look back into basics. \n\nLook out for the companion app, ECG flashcards by us in AppStore for rapid review of ECGs.\n\nIn future updates, we are planning to challenge you with pro features like self assessment so that you can evaluate yourself what you have learnt.\n\nPlease do post a positive review if you like the app. It means a lot for us. And is you have any issue, contact us at email provided below. Happy Learning."

This simple tool lets you report adverse effects to medicines, keep track of previously reported information and receive official news and alerts about medicines you are taking or interested in. \n \nWhy use the app?\n \n• Quick and easy to report adverse effects\n• Instant access to medicines safety information\n• Help make medicines safer for all\n• It’s free!\n \nKey features of the app\n \n• Submit reports on adverse effects even while offline\n• View and submit updates to previously submitted reports\n• See immediate acceptance of your reports\n• Create a ‘watch list’ of medications to receive personalised news and alerts\n \nWhy does it matter?\n \nMedicines are developed to be as safe and effective as possible, but they can still cause side effects. It is important for people to report adverse effects to medicines as this information can be used to identify previously unknown issues with those medicines.\n \nAdverse effects sometimes stop patients from completing their treatment, which can lead to even more serious problems. Reporting adverse effects encourages a dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals and helps professionals to identify and investigate unknown or poorly described adverse effects.\n \nThe Med Safety app has been developed as part of the WEB-RADR project. WEB-RADR is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI JU) under grant agreement n° 115632, resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and EFPIA companies’ in kind contribution."

Children use their voice to interact with characters on the screen: animals, lights, stars, and other objects.\n\nTYPICAL TODDLERS AND INFANTS\nEncouraging your toddler vocalizations may help him develop better control of his speech apparatus and improve word pronunciation.\n\nSPEECH THERAPY FOR NONVERBAL CHILDREN WITH LANGUAGE DELAY AND AUTISM\nWhy is your child not speaking? He sits alone in a dark and safe space. He doesn’t want to leave this safe shelter. He flinches when called upon. He trembles when looked at. The sounds are too harsh. The light is too bright and scary. People are too unpredictable. Because of his fear, the baby never wanted to talk to anyone and did not dare to meet anyone's eyes. \n\nVADA has been developed to help your child control his voice. As he sits in his usual shelter, he will hear a calm, quiet, and affectionate voice calling on him to respond. On the screen, everything is calm, safe, and predictable. He raises his voice to affect movement: to fly the balloon, to blow off leaves, interact with animated characters and so on. Controlling objects on the screen makes him more confident using his voice. Once confidence has been built, we can move to more complex exercises like Speech Interactive Therapy App (SITA) to shape his articulate speech and Language Therapy (Mental Imagery Therapy for Autism or MITA) to train his language and cognition."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

Covering over 70 conditions from an evidence-based pharmacy perspective, it outlines for each:\n•       Clinical Features\n•       Referral Criteria\n•       Timeframe to Resolution\n•       Management Strategies\n\nOTC Consult will aid clinical decision-making, give users increased confidence that their recommendations are aligned with current guidance, and standardise the care patients receive."

      "label": "What is tinnitus?\n\nTinnitus is the perception of a sound within the ear, without a real sound being actually emitted from outside the auricle.\n\nSome people do not find this condition to be of disturbance, while for others it can be extremely annoying as it is perceived as a constant whistle, buzz in the head or hiss that distracts the brain and diverts its capacity of concentration from everyday tasks.\n\nThe ear's educational treatments for tinnitus are based on sound therapy. During the latter, the patient listens to an artificially generated sound as similar as possible to the one his ear perceives for 4 to 6 hours a day. This sound masking mitigates the perception of sound, re-establishing a new threshold to auditory experiences.\n\nIf the audio treatment is continued for 6 weeks straight, the symptoms of tinnitus are lessened considerably, and even appear to disappear completely.\n\nHow to use this app\n\nTinnitus Relief Sound Masking System is avery modern system to find your tinnitus and provide a remedy. Wear some headphones. Select a masking sound from the list, choosing the one that most of all resembles the one perceived by your ears.\n\nEmit the sound by pressing the “Play” button. Adjust your volume until you feel like your tinnitus has completely disappeared. You can act only on a single audio channel or on both. You can also add music to make your experience more enjoyable.\n\nThe app has a library of noises available to mask your ear noise (7 are free, the others can be unlocked with the “Premium” package). You can find 5 environmental noises, 9 beep sounds (from 174 to 963 Hz), white and pink noises, 6 ambiental and nature noises (air conditioning, fan, hair dryer, vacuum cleaner, rain and water sounds).\n\nAnd here is the list of available songs to relax your ears and your head more (2 are free, the others can be unlocked with the “Premium” package):\n\nSerenity (new age music) (free)\nSoothing Melody (new age music)\nCalming Sounds (new age music)\nTotal Relaxation (new age music)\nDreams (new age music)\nRelaxing Piano Music (piano music) (free)\nThe Pianist (piano music)\nClassical Meditation (piano music)\nSlow Symphony (piano music)\nEmotions (piano music)\n\nWe confide this app can give you relief and help to fight some tinnitus symptoms.

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

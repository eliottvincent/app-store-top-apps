Supports twins!\n\nBeing a FTM (first-time-mom), or mom in general, is very tiring and challenging! You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders. Alarms and graphs are a great way to have an at-a-glance look at what you need to do without stressing over \"what if I forget?”.\n\nOur app will help you keep track of feedings, your baby’s weight and how long they were eating to make sure they’re gaining weight properly and at a normal rate. Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently. This baby care app will help you keep track of everything in one convenient place and help moms take care of themselves by having a peace of mind.\n\nEmail us your comments and suggestions, and we'll implement them as soon as possible!\n\nGOLD STATUS IN THE APP\n- You can subscribe to regularly updated backup and synchronization with relatives\n- The subscription costs $2.49 per month, $11.49 per year, $4.99 and $9.99 for lifetime\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n- Private Policy - https://wachanga.com/privacy\n- Terms of Use - https://wachanga.com/terms"

This will prevent you from getting bitten by mosquitos and other insects. The pitch of the sound is so high that most humans will not hear anything.\n\nOnly female mosquitoes bite humans and animals. They are attracted by light, body odor, lactic acid, carbon dioxide and heat.\n\nTurn on the application and keep it close to you it will produce high frequency sound and mosquitos will avert you. It is not 100% guaranteed but will repel most of mosquitos biting you. Its not foolproof because there are about 3500 admitted mosquito species in the world and they all react marginally different to the repeller.\n\nThe app does not guarantee a 100% protection as there are over 3500 known mosquito species in the world and they all react slightly different to the repellent. Use the pitch selector to find optimal repelling frequency for the mosquitoes in your region.\n\nYou can change the frequency of the ultrasound to make sure you find the ideal frequency (the higher the frequency is, more efficient it is)!"

Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves.

      "label": "Rhythm modules review ECG rhythm recognition. ACLS Cases is a simulator.\n\nThe new rhythm primer module presents the basics of reading electrocardiograms. The new challenge module provides three fun exercises to reinforce your ability to identify the EKG rhythm. This latest version has improved performance when internet connection is not available.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases will help you pass the American Heart Association Advanced Cardiac Life Support ACLS course. With regular use of ECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases you will maintain your cardiac resuscitation skills so that you will always be ready to serve as an effective leader of the 'code blue' team.\r\n\r\nECG Rhythms and ACLS Cases includes four modules to improve your ability to identify the ECG rhythm and treat the patient. The first module, ECG Rhythm Primer, reviews the basics of identifying the cardiac rhythm in electrocardiogram lead II. It describes the waves, intervals, and a four step method to identify the rhythm. Rhythm Tutor teaches and reinforces the organized four question approach to identification of electrocardiogram rhythms. When you think you have mastered identification of the rhythms in Rhythm Tutor, you should use Rhythm Challenge to test yourself.\r\n\r\nThe Rhythm modules present 80 different electrocardiogram wave forms as they sweep across the screen just like on a real ECG monitor. Recognition of EKG rhythms as the wave forms sweep across a monitor screen is a different skill than diagnosing cardiac rhythms on a static tracing. This app will improve your clinical skills more than reviewing with a book because you will learn to diagnose the EKG rhythms as they dynamically move across the screen.\r\n\r\nAfter you are comfortable identifying the cardiac rhythm, you can use the ACLS Cases module to practice the resuscitation of patients based on the latest ACLS guidelines. ACLS Cases enables you to rehearse megacode management in a realistic screen-based simulator. The current version follows the updated 2015 AHA treatment guidelines. You must evaluate the patient and electrocardiogram rhythm, decide on the appropriate management, and serve as the team leader guiding two assistants through the resuscitation including administration of electrical defibrillation and medications.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 cardiac arrest case scenarios included. The first three cover ventricular fibrillation, the next two are for pulseless ventricular tachycardia, another covers asystole, and the remainder of the cases cover tachycardia algorithms. This app is for training purposes only. Do not assume a real patient will behave exactly the same as any of the simulated patients, however, with regular practice you will always be ready to run a full cardiac resuscitation."

Click on the 'info' button within the App for details, and links for purchase.\n\nmore…\n\nFor examination of the ears, the App is designed to work best with the OtoscopeApp OTOSCOPE ADAPTER device, which can be purchased at the OtoscopeApp website.\n\nThe OtoscopeApp system can be used to safely examine the ears of both children and adults at home with little or no prior otoscopy experience.   The ear canal, ear drum, any ear wax and ear tubes placed in surgery can all be easily seen.  \n\nDirections:  Prior to use, remove your smartphone from any case you might be using.  Slide the OtoscopeApp.com Device on to the phone so that the main camera and flash are facing the extended, optical tube portion of the device.  Snap one of the ear speculums onto the end of the optical tube and open the OtoscopeApp application on your mobile device.  It is best to choose the largest ear speculum that will comfortably fit into the ear canal.  The App will default to ideal lighting and zoom settings, though these can be adjusted if you wish.   You can restart the App or hit the ‘RESET’ button at the bottom of the screen to restore the default settings at any time.  Insert the ear speculum gently into the external auditory canal of the ear while watching the screen on your smartphone.  You will begin to see structures inside the ear come into view.  It may help to use two hands – one holding the phone to examine the ear and the other to gently pull the external ear upward and back.  This will straighten out the EAC some for a better view.   The phone should auto focus, though it may help to lock the auto-focus by hitting the ‘AF/Lock’ button once the camera has focused adequately inside of the ear.  Video capability is available on the PRO version of the App, available as an In-App purchase.\n\nIf there is no evidence of external ear disease, the ear specula can be reused.  Cleaning between each use is recommended using soap and warm water.  You can also order new ear specula at our website.  The ear speculum should not be inserted more than ½ inch into the ear canal.  Discontinue use immediately if any pain or discomfort is experienced.  Do not use in patients with active ear drainage, bleeding or extremely small ear canals.  \n\nOtoscopeApp does not provide medical advice - always seek attention from a physician for any medical conditions, questions or concerns.  OtoscopeApp should not be considered a replacement for examination and consultation with a trained physician.\n\nThank you for choosing OtoscopeApp  -  please email us with any questions or feedback at support@otoscopeapp.com"

Currently despite the abundance of textbooks in infection, these are often bio-medically oriented with an emphasis on the biological mechanisms and clinical management. Tailored learning materials with a public health perspective are in short supply. The shortcoming is compounded by the relative lack of locally relevant resource materials which could be used for teaching purpose. This set of publications is designed to fill these gaps. Today, the number and diversity of people specialising in public health are continuing to rise. Hopefully, the book and the Apps would also serve as references for health and social science professionals working in the public health field in Hong Kong and other cities in the region."

      "label": "Doctor Care Anywhere is a new kind of health service that gives you the confidence and reassurance to look after you and your family's health - wherever you are, whenever you need us.\n\nFrom video and phone appointments with UK qualified registered Doctors at times that suit you, to a prescription delivery service, instant referrals, 24/7 access to your medical records and more, we are all about putting people in charge of their health.\n\nAppointment times to suit you\n\nIt’s easy to book an appointment with Doctor Care Anywhere. Just login through your device, find a time that works for you and book your appointment instantly. We’re open 8am-10pm, 365 days a year (UK time).\n\nThe modern family doctor\n\nChoose your doctor by the areas they specialise in, the languages they speak, their name if you’ve seen them before or by gender if you’d like to specifically like to speak to a male or female doctor. All our Doctors are UK registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) and Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) qualified and specially trained in virtual consultation skills.\n\nSame day medication\n\nYou can have your prescription medicine delivered to your door (4 hours within London, next day rest of UK) or get it sent to your nearest local UK pharmacy for you to pick up at a time that suits you.\n\nInstant referrals\n\nFollowing a thorough consultation, if appropriate, your Doctor Care Anywhere Doctor will write you an instant referral and email you to let you know it has been stored securely on your patient record. You can then download this to share with your specialist or insurer.\n\n24/7 secure access to your patient record\n\nYou can access your patient record at any time, update it as necessary and use it to download notes and referrals for future consultations.\n\nApple Health\n\nConnect to Apple Health and use your Watch to take your heart rate in a consultation and share the reading with the doctor.\n\nWhat our users say\n\n\"The advice from the GP was excellent and thorough and the whole service is refreshingly immediate. I have already recommended it to friends and family and will continue to do so.\" \nCharlie from Fulham\n\n\"I’m delighted my days of stuffy waiting rooms are over! I was able to make an appointment really quickly and easily with a doctor who really took the time to answer my questions fully and gave really informed and relevant advice.\"\nLucy from Surrey\n\n\"Doctor Care Anywhere has changed the way I view GP medical care from both a personal and professional perspective. Their online service is incredibly easy to use yet still maintains the highest level of personal care and privacy.\"\nLara from Warwickshire\n\n“There are times when it can be difficult to get to the doctor, especially for parents juggling home, work and small children. Having access to Doctor Care Anywhere, a service that allows you to consult with a doctor online or over the phone seven days a week is both handy and helpful, at the times when you need it most.\"\nJustine Roberts, CEO Mumsnet"

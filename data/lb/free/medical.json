      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

It helps you collect, track and analyse your measurements by composing them into a beautiful color-coded chart.\n\nBesides the usual features for this kind of app — like sharing reports to physician, or support for multiple profiles — Blood Pressure also employs couple of more interesting concepts that can help you find correlations between changes you make and the BP levels you are getting. Meet measurement tags and chart filters. You can create your own tags for marking the records with the facts like dietary choices, exercising regimes, stress levels, taken supplements or medications, etc. And then you can compose various chart filters based on those tags to compare the sets of measurements in before-and-after fashion.\n\nWe hope you will find Blood Pressure app useful in your wellbeing journey!"

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

In this app, you can tear the membrane flap with your finger to form a perfectly round opening for starting cataract surgery. \n- The aim of the game is the prevent the membrane from tearing out to the side, while maintaining a round tear path. \n\n***** Phacoemulsification of Lens ***** \n- An important part of cataract surgery is ultrasound phacoemulsification of lens (phaco). In this app you use your fingers to control a virtual ultrasound probe to phaco a lens. \n- You can control the position and angle of the probe by sliding your fingers \n- The aim is to phaco the lens into quadrants by following the guidelines and rotating the lens. Watch out not to puncture the posterior capsule or catch the anterior capsule rhexis edge! \n\nKey features: \n*** Rhexis *** \n- You get a score on how closely you reach the target \n- Time your procedure \n- Adjust the size of the pupil and density of the lens to increase the challenge \n- Adjust how spherical your lens is (affects how easily the tear goes out) \n- Tear the rhexis clockwise or anticlockwise \n- Save images of your rhexis for emailing to your friends \n\n*** Phaco *** \n* Use fingers to control phaco probe to phaco a lens into quadrants \n* Adjustable lens density \n* Adjustable capsulorhexis size \n* Save image of your phaco end result for email to your friends \n* Time your phaco procedure \n\n*** Note this app is a virtual reality simulator/game - it is not intended for cataract surgery training. *** \n\n\nPlease visit my blog http://donkeykong-george.blogspot.com/ for latest information and tips on updates for this game. \n\ncataractMobile App is Copyright© 2011 by Dr Yu Xiang George Kong MBBS BMedSci PhD"

How about you take your patients’ image data with you on your mobile device wherever you go?\r\nWith mRay you can now connect your entire hospital or doctor’s office with just one app that enables instant case based communication!\r\n\r\nWe developed mRay to combine the power and mobility of modern mobile devices to access your radiological images anywhere and anytime.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to other solutions, mRay is specifically designed for mobile devices. Important tools like annotations and measurements are available as well as an adaptable level window. Image data is encrypted and stored temporally locally on the device, removing the need of a permanent Internet or Wi-Fi connection while ensuring highest security standards. Most notably, mRay implements well-established security measures to protect your image data and privacy. An individual user and device authentication controls the image access of every user for every image.\r\n\r\nWith mRay you are ensuring a high standard of networking with your colleagues anytime and anywhere. The integrated Instant Messenger offers a secure communication platform to share DICOM images as well as key images, audio and text messages. E.g. now you can easily share the current state of your viewer with another colleague to get a secondary opinion. Moreover the app offers a telephony feature using VoIP enabling every aspect of mobile devices without compromising patient confidentiality.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, mRay works seamlessly with your existing infrastructure. A minimal server application needs to be installed which reads DICOM files from the disk and is able to receive files directly from your PACS. That’s all you need to start simplifying your everyday life at work!\r\nYou can check out the app in a demo mode.\r\n\r\nDo you want to view your patients’ image data anywhere and at anytime?\r\nmRay enables physicians to access images at home while on background duty or on the go.\r\nContact us on how to access your image data with mRay.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n- Viewer for radiological images (CT, MR, PR etc.)\r\n- Full functional client, no remote desktop viewer\r\n- Communication through messaging, audio messages or VoIP.\r\n- Intelligent connection management\r\n- MPRs\r\n- Optional pseudonymization\r\n- Query/Retrieve functionality\r\n- High security due to AES-256 based encryption\r\n- Server works seamlessly with every PACS\n\nIntended purpose:\n\nThe software mRay as a radiology instrument can be used by medical specialists for the visualization of image data. Image processing allows the calculation and visualization of healthy and abnormal tissues.\nThe patient group, for which mRay can be used, includes all patients from whom radiological image data has been created for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. In a worst-case scenario the medical condition of the patient may be critical.\nmRay can be operated in hospitals, medical practices, on the go or at home. The software is dedicated for mobile devices for fast and immediate access to radiologic images for informational purposes. When using mRay for diagnostic purposes, national regulations must be considered and an appropriate display must be used. mRay allows the display of images and data types that are defined by the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard (e.g. computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), fluoroscopy (XA), digital x-ray (CR), ultrasound (US)). The software offers common radiological software tools (e.g. windowing, measurements, thick slices and annotations)."

A few slide and tap action is enough for logging data.\n\nBlood Pressure Categories:\n\nWhat is blood pressure?\nAccording the National Institute Of Aging, Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries as the heart pumps blood. When a health care professional measures your blood pressure, they use a blood pressure cuff around your arm that gradually tightens. The results are given in two numbers. The first number, called systolic blood pressure, is the pressure caused by your heart contracting and pushing out blood. The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, is the pressure when your heart relaxes and fills with blood.\n\nThe blood pressure categories definition is from \n2018 ESC/ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension: The Task Force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH)  from \nhttps://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/33/3021/5079119\n\nand 2017 Guideline for High Blood Pressure in Adults by American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association\nfrom \nhttps://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2017/11/09/11/41/2017-guideline-for-high-blood-pressure-in-adults"

      "label": "IAM Medical Guidelines helps Canadian medical professionals become more familiar with a curated selection of the many Clinical Practice Guidelines they are increasingly expected to know about. We currently have guidelines for Asthma, COPD, Breast Cancer Recovery for primary care and patients, genetic screening, deprescribing of BZRAs, CHEIs, memantine, PPIs, AHGs and antipsychotics, and Shared Decision Making for Abdominal Aortic Aneurism, Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Cancer of the Colon, Lung Cancer and Prostate Cancer, with more to come!\n\nIAM is a single container for these Guidelines; we started with an accredited program in partnership with the Canadian Thoracic Society and their 2012 Guideline Update: Diagnosis and Management of Asthma in Preschoolers, Children and Adults. This has been followed with recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of Asthma in preschoolers (2015), Severe Asthma Guidelines (2017) and COPD (2017).\n\nThe app also includes Breast Cancer Survivorship guidelines deriving from the work of Marian Luctkar-Flude RN PhD, Alice Aiken PhD, Mary Ann McColl PhD, Joan Tranmer RN PhD and Hugh Langley MD CCFP, published in Canadian Family Physician (Le Médecin de famille canadien) Vol 61: november 2015. These key guideline recommendations for post-treatment breast cancer care were synthesized from existing guidelines produced by credible cancer care and primary care organizations, and align with the most recent guidelines published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the American Cancer Society in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Vol 34(6): 2016. \n\nNotably, we include Breast Cancer Recovery guidelines for Breast Cancer survivors; this is the same information as in Breast Cancer Survivorship, but presented for non-medical professionals.\n\nA more recent addition is GEC-KO, a channel published by Genetics Education Canada whose mandate is to increase genetics literacy in health care professionals and thereby enhance quality of care in order to optimize the health and well-being of Canadians.\n\nThe most recent channel is Deprescribing, a Decision Support application applying the methods and algorithms developed by Dr. Barb Farrell and Dr. Cara Tannenbaum and their collaborators. See https://deprescribing.org.\n\nWe simplify study by:\n•\tFeaturing only guidelines published by recognized authorities\n•\tSelecting the recommendations most important to the intended audience of each guideline, using a Delphi process\n•\tWorking with guideline authors to condense each recommendation for easy scanning on the “Topics” page\n•\tUsing Push Notification to gently highlight a different recommendation each week\n•\tPresenting each recommendation at three levels; Topics (searchable list of condensed recommendations), Recommendation (the full monte) and Guideline (the recommendation shown in context in the full guideline)\n•\tOptimizing the guideline for easy reading on small devices, while maintaining access to the full original content\n\nWe encourage study by:\n•\tPromoting reflective learning, using ITPCRG’s research-proven Information Assessment Method (https://www.mcgill.ca/iam/home-page); for each recommendation, a short questionnaire encourages reflection on how the information could be valuable to the practitioner.\n\nAll the app content is stored on our servers and downloaded to your device when you add a new channel, so you can study anywhere – the subway, in-flight, at the cottage…  As new guidelines are added, they will become available for download, and corrections and updates to existing guidelines will be incorporated seamlessly. The app keeps itself up-to-date.\n\nOur goal is to become a one-stop shop for Medical Guidelines, so that you only need to invest your valuable time (and iPhone homepage real estate) in a single app, rather than downloading and learning about a separate app for each guideline."

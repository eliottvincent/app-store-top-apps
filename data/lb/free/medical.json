Measure your stress to manage it!\n\n- What is the principle behind StressScan? − \nMany of the functions essential to maintaining human health are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is medically recognized that the balance of the autonomic nervous system can become disordered through fatigue and other stress, stemming from causes such as work and human relationships. By analyzing the waveform of your heartbeat as measured at the fingertip, StressScan can analyze the balance of your autonomic nervous system and measure your stress level on a stress index of 1 to 100.\n\n- You can trust StressScan! - \nThe technology used by StressScan is based on heart rate variability analysis, which is widely recognized in the field of heart rate analysis and autonomic nervous system research. \nAlthough heart rate variability analysis technology is not yet generally well known, many medical institutions and companies have taken an interest and are beginning to put it to use. The technology is seeing use even at the cutting edge of stress care, including adoption by the US military to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers returning from the battlefield, and by NASA for astronaut training and health management.\n\n- Usable in a range of scenarios! - \n· Periodic checking of daily stress level\n· Checking the effects of favorite meals and drinks on stress\n· Checking relaxation while traveling or at a favorite spot\n\n- Device compatibility -\nThe app is intended for use with a camera- and flash-equipped smartphone. It is not usable with devices that do not have a camera and flash.\n\n- Usage environment -\nAn Internet connection is required to use the app. External support for measurement functions is used for complex stress analysis."

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

You’ve just made it home from the hospital, exhausted and overwhelmed by your new responsibilities, and need a little help. Don’t worry! In the first few months of your baby's life, it really revolves around eating, sleeping, diaper changes and occasional little doctor's visits. As a new mom, it’s not always easy to remember the last time you fed your baby or changed their diaper. We don’t blame you for falling asleep on the couch occasionally, so we’ve got you covered with handy alarms and reminders.

Unfortunately for some parents, it’s imperative that they track every last drop of food their baby eats since some infants are born with illnesses that make it harder to gain weight normally. Keeping track of diapers is also imperative to keeping your baby healthy. Everyone needs an easy way to check how often they’re changing diapers, and if everything looks normal during each change.\n\nJust click the appropriate button at the beginning of the feeding and other activities. Your baby care history will be reliably stored. All this information may be useful when you visit the pediatrician, as well as for the further development of your child.\n\nCheck your baby’s day to day activities easily and efficiently.

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

      "label": "In 1963, Dar Al Shifa Hospital (DASH) was established as the first private hospital in the State of Kuwait. Originally, it was a maternity hospital located in Sharq, Kuwait city. Since that time, the hospital became a leading health care organization in the region.\n\nIn 1992, DASH went through a notable expansion under the ownership of Mr. Ali Jeraq who had a visionary goal to make healthcare services accessible to every individual in the community. As a result, DASH developed into a fully-fledged general hospital that included a wide scope of services.\n\nOver the last few years, DASH has proved itself as a trustworthy organization in which patient/family-centered care is provided through a competent and diverse team of health care professionals utilizing the latest technology and applying evidence-based practices. Another significant achievement of DASH is attaining recognized international accreditation and awards from Accreditation Canada and American College of Radiology.\n\nToday, DASH is continuously growing and evolving as a distinguished health care organization with a focus on providing comprehensive and specialized services to meet the needs of the community. DASH dedication towards development and growth is reflected in the ongoing expansion which will make it the largest private hospital in Kuwait.\n\nفي عام 1963، تم تأسيس مستشفى دار الشفاء كأول مستشفى خاص في دولة الكويت. وقد كان بالأساس مستشفى متخصص للنساء والولادة يقع في منطقة شرق، بمدينة الكويت. ومنذ ذلك الوقت، أصبح المستشفى مؤسسة رعاية صحية رائدة في المنطقة.\n\nفي عام 1992، مر مستشفى دار الشفاء بمرحلة توسعات تحت إشراف المالك السيد/ علي جراق والذي كان يمتلك رؤية وهدفاً في تمكين كل فرد في المجتمع من الحصول على خدمات الرعاية الصحية. ونتيجة لذلك، حقق مستشفى دار الشفاء تطوراً كبيراً وأصبح مستشفى عام متكامل يتضمن مجموعة واسعه من الخدمات.\n\nوعلى مدى السنوات الأخيرة، برهن مستشفى دار الشفاء عن أصالته وأنه مؤسسة موثوقة حيث يكون المريض وعائلته هم مركز الإهتمام والرعاية، ويتم تقديم الخدمات من قبل فريق متنوع ومختص من مقدمي الرعاية الصحية بإستخدام أحدث التقنيات وتطبيق الممارسات الصحية الموصى بها عالمياً. ومن الإنجازات الهامة والبارزة التي حققها المستشفى أيضاً حصوله على شهادات اعتماد عالمية معتمدة من مجلس اعتماد الجودة الكندي والكلية الأمريكية للأشعة.\n\nواليوم، يعتبر مستشفى دار الشفاء مؤسسة بارزة ومستمرة التطور في مجال الرعاية الصحية والتي تُركز على تقديم الخدمات المتخصصة والشاملة لمواكبة احتياجات المجتمع. إن تكريس مستشفى دار الشفاء لجهوده نحو النمو والتطور ينعكس من خلال التوسع المستمر والذي يجعل منه أكبر المستشفيات الخاصة في دولة الكويت."

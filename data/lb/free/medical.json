Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators.

Create blood pressure reports in PDF format with blood pressure data, charts and stats and share with your doctor or healthcare provider. \n\n- View 7, 14, 30 day summary grouped by daily AM/PM averages and tags. Create, share and print summary PDF reports and CSV file.\n\n- Print PDF reports or charts directly\n\n- Analyze the progress you are making using intuitive graphs and statistics (including mean and variability for a period). Filter the data analyzed based on tags which can prove useful in analyzing how well you are doing and if any lifestyle modifications or medications have proven effective. Compare graphs and stats based on your tags side by side. See correlation for systolic vs. diastolic blood pressure.\n\n- Add ECG records\n\n- Back up your health data and access it on all your mobile devices with SmartBP Cloud.  This is an optional service. We do not sell your health data.\n\n- Sync directly between iPhone and iPad through Bluetooth or WiFi without sharing on the cloud.\n\n- Backup all your blood pressure data by exporting your file to iTunes, Dropbox and Drive.

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Everybody needs to continue to act carefully and remain cautious.\n\nDownload the app and keep it up to date to receive the latest guidance.\n\nThe app uses proven privacy software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. You can delete your data, or the app, at any time.\n\nThe NHS COVID-19 app features:\n\nAlerts: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have since tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nLatest information: Find out the latest COVID-19 guidance and know the level of COVID-19 risk in your local area.\n\nSymptoms: Check if you have COVID-19 symptoms and follow the latest guidance.\n\nTest:  Enter any positive test result (NHS or paid-for) to anonymously notify other app users who were near you that they might be at risk. You'll also get the latest health advice.\n \nAvailable in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.\n\nThe app can be used when travelling across England, Wales, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), and alerting them if they have been in contact with someone who later reported a positive test result in the app.\n\nThe app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.\n\nThe app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended)."

From there, users will be given information regarding a specific characteristic regarding a drug and the user will then select from a list of drugs which one is the correct answer.  \n\nThere are no other pharmacology resources that allow users to do this.  Our database contains over 2000 flashcards that users can test their pharmacology knowledge on.\n\nIn addition, Flashcard Pharmacology contains a full drug\ndirectory with information about each drug at your fingertips!\n\nUsers can also access the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) supplement\nwhich contains information and tests on ANS function.\n\nFlashcard pharmacology is regularly updating info and looking for interested students who would like to be a part of our team.  If you have any questions about our app please email us at:\nflashcardmed@gmail.com"

The chart was smoothed to avoid discontinuity between the preterm datasets and the World Health Organization (WHO) Growth Standard, to promote an improved transition between preterm and WHO growth charts. This implementation uses LMS parameters (skew, median, and standard deviation) to allow calculation of precise percentiles and Z-scores.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• gender-specific, from 22 4/7 to 50 0/7 weeks gestation\n• calculation of percentile and Z-scores for weight, length, and head circumference\n• alert for small (less than 10th percentile) or large (greater than 90th percentile) for gestation\n• displays growth needed to maintain current percentile\n• convenient buttons to display 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile measurements\n• slider selection to display measurement between 1st and 99th percentile"

And you can buy cheap air tickets. How do you like the idea?\n- You can subscribe to notifications about the cheapest air ticket, the most convenient one or the most direct flight (yes, this is possible as well). This way you can keep track of changes in the cost of plane tickets. As soon as the price changes, we will send you a notification.\n- But these are not all of the subscriptions! You can also subscribe to the search for air tickets from your city and catch cheap tickets for a plane that flies in the most unexpected direction. What a surprise!\n- We also have a \"Price Schedule\" - it helps you buy a cheap ticket if you are not tied to the departure date.\n- And the \"Price Map\" - in case you have not yet decided on your destination. The map shows both domestic and international flights.\n- We save the passengers' passport information so that next time booking a flight won't take much time.\n- It's so comfortable to plan weekend trips with us, to fly on Saturday morning and to go back on Sunday evening.\n- And maybe you want to see around during the stopover - we will tell you which option is the most convenient if you want to see another city during the trip (also this type of air tickets is cheaper).\n- Our developers made app filters for any occasion, including for tickets with luggage and filtering for aircraft models.\n- If you don't want to search for flights on exact dates, you can choose one or several months and we will find plane tickets in a given range.\n\nBy the way, it's not only plane tickets search. We can also search for:\n\n- Accommodation with recommendations according to your interests: business trip, family, romantic, good for instagram and so on.\n- Guided and self-guided tours.\n- Cars and transfers to get from the airport to the hotel. And wherever else you want to go\n\nDownload the WayAway app now to start traveling and buy tickets.\n\n*** The application from WayAway.com allows you to find the lowest possible cost of an air ticket. We do not sell anything, we help you find flights online with the best conditions.\n\nTerms of use of the WayAway Plus subscription: https://wayaway.io/plus-terms-of-use"

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others.

      "label": "Silicon Valley’s new success story, inDrive is a free ride-hailing app available in more than 700 cities in 47 countries. We are growing fast by putting the power back in the hands of people.\n\ninDrive first emerged as a taxi alternative — a mobility app where affordable rides for passengers would still mean well-paid rides for drivers. \n \nBut now, there’s so much more to it. You can use inDrive to travel to other cities, send and receive packages, book a truck for your personal or business needs, and even hire a local pro to help you with whatever you need. You can also sign up as a driver, courier, or tasker.\n\nThe main idea is the same for all services: A fair price is the one you agree on — not hope for. inDrive exists to prove that people can always come to an agreement. \n\nWhat We Offer\nCITY RIDES\nAffordable everyday rides with no surge pricing. You get to set the fare and choose your ride based on the driver’s price offer, rating, number of completed rides, car model, and pickup time.\n\nINTERCITY RIDES\nA safe and convenient way to travel between cities. Specify your destination, pickup date, time and location, offer your fare and request a ride. \n\nCOURIER SERVICES\nThis door-to-door on-demand delivery service is a fast and safe way to send and receive packages of up to 20 kilos. Offer your fare ​​and track your delivery in real-time.\n\nFREIGHT SERVICES\nBook a truck for your delivery and moving needs. Set the time and the fare and specify any extra details in the comments. Wait for the offers to roll in and choose the one that works best for you.\n\nPROFESSIONAL SERVICES\nFrom home improvement to tutoring and beauty care services. Describe your task, name your price and get skilled help from local pros you can trust.\n\nWhy choose inDrive\nQUICK AND EASY\nIt's simple and fast to request an affordable ride — just enter points \"A\" and \"B\" in the app, name the fare you are willing to pay, and choose your driver.\n\nOFFER YOUR FARE\ninDrive provides you with a tailored, surge-free ride-hailing experience. Here you, and not the algorithm, decide on the fare and choose the driver. We do not set the pricing according to time and mileage like other services. You agree on a win-win price with the driver before the ride starts.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR DRIVER\ninDrive lets you choose your driver from a list of the drivers who accepted your ride request. Pick them based on the best deal, arrival time, driver's rating, number of completed trips, and even a car model.\n\nSTAY SAFE\nSee the driver's name, car model, license plate number, and the number of previously completed trips before accepting the ride. During your trip, you can share the driver's information and the real-time location of the car with your family or friends using the \"Share Your Ride\" button. Your real-time geolocation can be shared via messengers, social networks, e-mail, or SMS Text. All of that is there to make your experience safe & trusted. We're continuously adding new safety features to the app to make sure both riders and drivers can enjoy 100% safe rides.\n\nADD TRAVEL OPTIONS\nDo you have specific requirements? Specify travel add-ons — SUV, extra stops on the way, a child seat, or accommodating special needs. You can write your specific needs or any other details in the comments field like \"traveling with my pet,\" “I have luggage,\" etc.\n\nSIGN UP AS A DRIVER & MAKE EXTRA MONEY\nIf you have a car, inDrive provides an excellent opportunity to make extra money. Set your schedule and enjoy complete transparency with inDrive. See your passenger's drop-off location and fare before accepting the ride request. If the passenger’s price doesn’t seem enough, you can always offer your fare or skip the rides you don’t like with no penalties.\nBest of all, low-to-no service rates mean you make more money driving with inDrive!\n\nWe can't wait for you to experience it. Install the app and let’s ride!"

Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango. These scooters are bright yellow (not lime green), so you can't miss them! Easily order a scooter, find locations on the map (they look like a dot), and build routes with the same high-quality scooters you know and love, all in one convenient, top-tier app. We offer free unlocks and 20 NIS discounts on the first 3 rides to everyone who loves the feel of the wind in their hair.

After less than ten minutes you’ll already be able to speak a few words. Just give it a try, and you’ll soon realize!\n\nThese 400 expressions for travelers have been selected with care. They have been divided into 17 topics, corresponding to different situations that you may encounter in everyday life.\n\nNatural speaking voices, original illustrations, comprehension quizzes and an audio facility are just some of the many features that help you to memorize rapidly, and make the app enjoyable to use. \n\nEqually, this app is ideal for those who wish to start learning a foreign language, and who want to use this as their first language course to make real progress very quickly.\n\n* * *\n\nThe expressions given in each language are not literal translations from another language; they are the expressions that would normally be used in particular situations that people find themselves in when traveling. The translators, all of whom are professionals, have not always chosen the grammatically closest translation, because that would not necessarily be the one used most often when you’re there! \n\nHere’s a very simple example: in French, the phrase ‘please’ is often used when making a request, but it’s quite different in Finnish and in most of the Asian languages. \n\nTranslating is essentially a question of personal choice: if you feel that another translation would be more appropriate than the one suggested by this app, please write to us directly using contact form here, or better still via the contact page on our website www.loecsen.com. \n\nWe make every effort to ensure that the content we provide is as authoritative as possible.\n\n* * *\n\nList of topics: \nEssentials, Conversation, Looking for someone, Time tracking, Parting, Bar, Restaurant, Taxi, Transportation, Hotel, Beach, Family, Feelings, Learning, Colours, Numbers, In case of trouble"

Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

Save hundreds of dollars compared to other travel sites.\n\nDiscover extraordinary travel deals, set fare alerts, and uncover great hotel rates.\n\nWe’re so good, United Airlines actually sued us for it!\n\n• Find flights other search engines won’t show you -- including HIDDEN-CITY flights and arbitrary round-trips\n• Filter flights by duration, number of layovers, takeoff/landing time and more\n• Our powerful search engine pulls in the best deals to save you from having to google flights and check multiple sites\n• Monitor prices for trips you have in the hopper and let us alert you when the best deal is available\n• Book hotels as well, including last-minute hotels and special deals\n• Filter hotels, read reviews and view traveler ratings\n• We now offer car rental as well, so you can use one app as your complete trip planner\n• Our new Stories feature lets you book activities for your vacation - take a brewery tour, rent a kayak, or buy tickets in advance and get your guide to museums and exhibits\n\nThe fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

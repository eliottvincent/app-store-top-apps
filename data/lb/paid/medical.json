      "label": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance."

      "label": "What is iBP?\n\niBP is a blood pressure tracking and analysis tool. Please note, it is not possible to measure your blood pressure by touching the screen. A separate device is required.\n\nWhat kind of analysis does iBP provide?\n\niBP uses color icons to indicate when your blood pressure values are normal, high, or hypertension. It also provides interactive graphs that allow you to display your values by weeks, months, year and time of day. The graphs display lows, highs, averages, and trend lines using statistical analysis.\n\nWhy iBP vs. other blood pressure apps?\n\niBP is a universal app designed to work on the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which means you only pay for the app once and you get all versions! iBP is the only blood pressure app with a built in transfer capability to sync all your iOS devices.\n\nWhat are the key features?\n\n* Reads and writes Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data (details below)\n* Easy data input using dials instead of keyboard\n* Transfer capability to sync all of your iOS devices\n* Calculates Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure\n* Track one personal item (blood glucose, stress level, medication dosage, exercise time)\n* Backup / Restore capability\n* Multiple users\n* Multiple email addresses (you and doctor)\n* Multiple email formats (PDF, HTML, CSV, Plain Text)\n* Passcode to protect your data\n* Touch Id for passcode on devices that support it\n* Snapshot of the graphs can be saved\n* User configurable color ranges\n* Weight units (lb or kg)\n* Withings Blood Pressure Monitor & Wireless Scale\n\nApple Health\niBP is now able to read and write Apple Health blood pressure, pulse, and weight data. If your blood pressure monitor (i.e., Omron, iHealth, Withings) adds data to Apple Health then you can easily import that data into this app. If you manually input your data into this app, then it will write that data to Apple Health.\n\nWithings + iBP = No more data entry!\niBP can retrieve your blood pressure and weight data directly from your Withings account.  The Blood Pressure Monitor and wireless Body Scale automatically record and send the data to your account.  There is no data entry required and you can view the data anywhere using a web browser or a variety of mobile apps.\n\n\nDisclaimer: iBP is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor.

A great help !\n“The Cry Translator makes parenting easier. It's like having our son's grandmother there to help when he cries. The Cry Translator has also helped my husband become a more doting father. With this app we are both more relaxed so we can calm our baby down quickly. As a result we have found our son cries less. Peace has returned to our home! (…)” \nMom Patty\n\nYour baby won’t stop crying. You’ve tried feeding him, burping him and playing with him but nothing seems to be working. You don’t know what to do and baby can’t tell you what he needs. Or can he?\n\nWith the Cry Translator, it takes less than five seconds to find out what your baby’s cry means. Think of this app as a universal translator between infant and parent or caregiver. Just hit the Start button and Cry Translator analyzes which of the five distinct cries your infant is making before giving you great tips to calm and soothe your upset baby.\n\nThe suggestions you get from Cry Translator are 96% effective, in accordance with clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital. These tips are real, valuable pieces of information from a studied, medically proven source. \n\nNaturally, Cry Translator is a helpful tool, not a medical device. If baby cries excessively or there are any concerns about baby’s health, a physician should be sought to determine the cause of the distress. For the five most common and distinct types of infant cries though, Cry Translator is the perfect tool, especially for new parents.\n\nJust look at the features you get in Cry Translator:\n* Attractive, easy to use interface\n* Identifies the 5 distinct cries made by infants\n* Takes less than 5 seconds to get a translation\n* Each translation is accompanied by helpful tips and suggestions\n* Add emergency contacts from your address book for fast, easy access\n* Winner of Medal of Gold at Salon des Inventions de Genève 2010\n* Includes tutorial\n* Great for new parents, grandparents and caregivers\n\nYour baby is telling you what he or she needs and wants, you just don’t speak the same language yet. Let Cry Translator help. Download the app now to your iPhone or iPod Touch with a microphone, so you’re prepared for the next time grandma and grandpa babysit or you just aren’t sure how to soothe your infant. You and baby will both be glad that you did.\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTING - According to clinical research conducted in a pediatric hospital in Spain, 96% of babies ceased crying after applying the suggestions displayed by the Cry Translator®. The 4% of cases that did not respond to the suggestions may have been affected by external noise or issues not related to the five types of crying the Cry Translator deciphers.

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!"

Some of these conditions could never be experienced live!\n\nExplore this spatial application. As you walk towards the heart, the heartbeat becomes louder, due to the integrated spacial sound and to make this experience even more engaging you can also feel the heartbeat on the palm of your hand using haptic feedback on iPhone.\n\nDive into the amazingly detailed model of the heart and explore the new blood flow simulation.\n\nTap on the spatial annotations to get more dedicated information for each region of the heart from every angle. \n\nAnd there is a lot more to come - so stay tuned!\nThis and the other following apps in the INSIGHT-series will take medical education to a whole new level - no one has ever seen the human heart in this way before."

After gallons of coffee and many sleepless nights spent pouring over notes and textbooks, you still wonder if you’re going to make it.\n\nPreparing for a career in medicine requires learning a daunting amount of information and technique. When facing an important test of your knowledge and abilities, like the physical examination of a patient, nerves can derail all of your memorization and confidence, in a hurry.\n\nYou know the material; you just need a little last minute boost and memory jogger to quell the stage fright. That’s where Physical Exam Essentials comes to the rescue. \n\nThis application lets you look up selected terms, view illustrations of physical exam maneuvers, read the Clinical Correlates to discover the significance of certain findings and find descriptions of special tests. Physical Exam Essentials even offers a guide for describing your findings.\n\nPhysical Exam Essentials is not a comprehensive medical reference. Rather, it is a handy overview resource that is perfect for medical students, pre-meds, health professionals and anyone who practices or has an interest in medicine. Conveniently located on your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad, this application provides quick, easy-to-use reviews of procedures and techniques for 14 different categories:\n\n* The Health History\n * The General Survey \n* Skin and Nails \n* HEENT and Neck \n* Thorax and Lungs\n * Breast and Axillae\n * Cardiovascular Exam \n* Peripheral Vascular System\n * Abdominal Exam \n* Male G*******a, Anus, Rectum, Prostate\n * Female G*******a, Anus, Rectum\n * Mental Status Exam \n* Cranial Nerves\n * Neurological Exam \n\nAs you can see, Physical Exam Essentials has got you covered for examining your patients. That’s not all, though. Just look at some of the other features you get!\n\n* Attractive, easy to navigate interface\n* Look up certain selected terms in Wikipedia, Google, or Google images\n * Pictures in each section help to illustrate physical exam maneuvers\n * Includes \"Clinical Correlates\" which highlight the significance of certain physical exam findings\n * \"Presentation Tips\" included to help you describe your findings \n* Includes descriptions of special tests that are not usually performed in a routine physical exam\n * Content and images added and updated regularly \n\nForget carrying those heavy textbooks everywhere you go. Sometimes, all you need is your iDevice and Physical Exam Essentials.\n\nDownload this amazingly helpful application now. You and your patients will be glad that you did."

With V. 2.0 we added clinic videos.\n\n- How would you perform a post-extraction cross suture on a patient taking anticoagulant medication so as to keep the haemostatic sponge in the socket in place?\n\n- How would you perform a simple continuous suture after multiple extractions and/or alveolar ridge correction?\n\nThese are just two of the questions this application answers. In both cases, a loop suture would have been  less effective and a waste of time.\n\nThe list of suturing techniques dealt with in this application, which currently stands at 9, will be gradually increased with free updates.

      "label": "Simple, fast, yet more thorough than any other pregnancy wheel available for the iPhone, Perfect OB Wheel is better than just a replacement for your trusty paper wheel.\n\nHere's why Perfect OB Wheel is your best choice of gestational calculator:\n\n 1) Input flexibility: Start with one of:\n    • Last menstrual period (LMP)\n    • Conception date\n    • Estimated date of confinement/delivery (EDC)\n    • Ultrasound dating: Number of weeks and days gestation as of a given date (\"X Weeks\").\n\n 2) Input speed: Other wheels for the iPhone make you conform to them for entering your patient's information. Why not be able to choose based on how you are holding the phone and what else you are doing at the same time?\n    • Use the numeric entry pad (0 3 3 0 2 0 0 8) and immediately see the results, OR\n    • Spin the date wheel at the bottom of the screen and tap Next.\n\n 3) Thorough results: All the information you would expect from a classic wheel, plus more:\n   • Estimated Due Date\n   • LMP Date\n   • Conception Date\n   • 1st Trimester End Date\n   • 2nd Trimester End Date\n   • Gestational Age\n   • Conceptional Age\n   • Expected Fetal Length based on standard fetal growth curves\n   • Expected Fetal Weight based on standard fetal growth curves (\"How much does my baby weigh, doctor?\")\n\nResults are relative to 'today' by default; this can be quickly changed to reflect any date by tapping the 'today' button and selecting a new date.\n\n 4) Accurate results: Perfect OB Wheel provides exact dates and accounts for all calendar variance, including leap years. \n\n 5) Persistence: Perfect OB Wheel remembers the date and date type you last used and restores them when launched to streamline your workflow.\n\n 6) Perfect OB Tracker upgrade: Available as an in-app purchase update, the Perfect OB Tracker lets you track any number of pregnancies, with at-a-glance due date and gestational age and one-tap access to all the data Perfect OB Wheel provides.  A  picture and text notes can be kept on each patient. Postpartum tracking is also available. Passcode locking is available for HIPAA compliance."

This app does not replace the original manuscript of these landmark critical care trials – instead, it serves as a fast reference and learning tool for some of the most important ICU trials over a wide range of specialties.\n\nEach entry contains a short one-liner about the critical care trial and key points, which includes only the most pertinent details, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, treatment protocols, pertinent endpoints and findings, as well as expert commentary regarding key subgroup analyses or limitations to the trial.\n\nWant to send a colleague a citation? Use the \"Share Trial\" button to send a PubMed link and quick summary. Using this feature, it’s incredibly easy to share pivotal critical care trials with students, residents, and other colleagues.\n\nThe database features 150+ landmark trials related to: ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT/PE, delirium, glycemic control, heart failure, hemorrhage, meningitis, nephroprotection, nutrition, pneumonia, sedation, seizure, sepsis/shock, spinal cord injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage – with more trials and topics to be added on a regular basis!\n\nThis app is designed and maintained by Sean P. Kane, PharmD, BCPS -- a clinical pharmacist specializing in critical care with a background in information technology and application development."

Wherever you are within the allied health professions - medical school, nursing school, NP school, PA school, residency, and beyond - you can improve your knowledge base in the short and long term with these key associative memory aids.\n\nMedical Mnemonics puts 1796 clever acronyms, rhymes, and memory tricks on your iPhone or iPod Touch, covering topics ranging from Anatomy and Biochemistry to Pharmacology and Surgery.\n\nThe database is fully searchable and can be quickly filtered by discipline and by system. Create a Favorites list, and search and filter it similarly.\n\nThe best mnemonics can be those you make yourself. Add your own mnemonics to the database, where they'll appear seamlessly alongside those which come with the program.  Submit them instantaneously to the Medical Mnemonics server for review by an MD (that's me!) and inclusion in the next version.\n\nYou can email any mnemonic to a colleague from within Medical Mnemonics. He or she can view it within the email or add it to their own copy of Medical Mnemonics with a single click.\n\nUpdates will be free for life and will include new mnemonics submitted by users (that's you!) and added as we all continue learning together.\n\nEvery mnemonic is physician-reviewed, but we're only human. If you find a mistake, email us; we will pay a $5 bounty per substantive mistake found to the first reporter of that mistake!"

      "label": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. Now supports Apple Airpods and Bluetooth Headphones.\n\n\"It took some time and patience... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the USA and 102 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's fetal sounds (kicks, heartbeat etc.) - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first. Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's heart beat, sounds (kicks, heart beat and more) and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nNOTE: It takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it. When you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with Hear My Baby heartbeat and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling (can't find your own heartbeat etc. DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your fetal sound. We recommend Bluetooth Headphones for best results.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. Listen to your own heartbeat first to confirm the app is set up correctly. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best baby heartbeat results.\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for Hear My Baby to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other fetal sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\n13,12, X, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong :) Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA. This is not a medical device and is not a medical baby heartbeat monitor. It is for FUN.\n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp"

A detailed manual with 14 chapters is an ideal companion if you are a medical student, radiology resident, radiographer, a medic on the ward or preparing for board exams. It teaches the beginner (and perhaps not so much of a beginner) the technique of interpreting a chest radiograph. Over 70 flash cards on specific conditions provide short and succinct information, ideal when that odd looking film shows up on the screen. Unlike a traditional book, each condition is provided with multiple example images for better understanding.\n\nThanks to the beautiful high resolution screen, iCXR virtually turns your device to a mini PACS work station. Zoom the image by using familiar pinch gestures, use built in tools to change contrast and brightness and invert the image for a near real life experience. Over 100 detailed pictorial and text annotations superimposed on the images help better understanding. You can turn off the annotations to appreciate the findings better.\n\niCXR – The modern chest radiograph reference.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Works on both iPhone and iPad with a single purchase\n \n- No internet connection required\n\n- Largest chest radiograph library on the iphone \n\n- High quality zoomable radiographs\n\n- Zoomable text and pictorial annotations overlaid on the image that can be toggled\n\n- Multiple examples per condition\n\n- Links from text to appropriate images\n\n- Image manipulation tools that simulate a PACS work station\n\n- Manual to teach chest radiograph interpretation\n\n- Flash cards for quick reference"

Having trouble explaining the exact course of the fever to the pediatrician? Keep track of body temperatures and medication for your whole family with Feevy.\n\n\nTEMPERATURE, MEDICATION AND NOTES\nWith Feevy you can not only record temperature measurements, but also track medications and enter text notes. This way, you can verify if medication was effective and capture additional information, e.g. regarding the patient’s condition. Be perfectly prepared for your next visit to the doctor!\n\nBEAUTIFUL CHARTS\nEntering data is worthless if you can’t analyze it later. Feevy comes with a beautiful and very detailed interactive chart, which makes it easy to get a quick overview, as well as to analyze temperature curves in more detail. You can freely zoom and pan it to see all the details you need.\n\nPRINT AND SHARE YOUR DATA\nOf course you can also print and export your data. This way you can bring your fever curve with you to the doctor or even send it via e-mail. The PDF contains all measurements, medications and notes, as well as a full-page chart showing the temperature curve.\n\nTRACK MULTIPLE PEOPLE\nFeevy lets you track the fever curves for multiple people. It is perfect for keeping track of your children's conditions and illnesses. To represent your family with some personality, Feevy comes with a set of cute profile icons to choose from.\n\nSYNC WITH FAMILY MEMBERS\nEspecially if you use Feevy to track your kids' illnesses, you will appreciate its sync functionality. No matter who measures the temperature or administers medication, both parents will always see the same data on their devices.\n\nUNIVERSAL APP\nFeevy supports both iPhone and iPad, including iPad multitasking (Slide Over and Split View). Use your iPhone while on the go or to quickly enter a new measurement, and use the iPad to have a detailed look at the charts.\n\n\nFeedback is always welcome: feedback@feevyapp.com or via Twitter @feevyapp.\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nIn case of fever and sickness, please always consult your doctor. Using this app to track body temperature and symptoms is not a substitute for a visit to the doctor!\n\nOF COURSE YOU CANNOT MEASURE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WITH THIS APP! You can only record, visualize and archive the measurements obtained with a fever thermometer."

      "label": "Cholesterol management is a complex, necessary task in a huge number of patient encounters. We know that getting it right is a vital part of promoting long-term health. Let ATP3 Lipids help!\r\n\r\nThe Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults - or the ATP III for short - describes the evidence-based cholesterol testing and management recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program. These guidelines categorize lipid levels by lipoprotein type, define cholesterol goals based on specific patient characteristics, and describe therapeutic recommendations for management of cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids puts fast and thorough access to this cholesterol management algorithm on your iPhone or iPod Touch, from your patients' specific cholesterol goals to details of cholesterol management drugs (dosing, percentage change, side effects, and contraindications).\r\n\r\nYou input your patients' data - lipid panel by numbers and risk factors by simply tapping to select. Input is beautiful and easy, using the popular interface from MediMath.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids then shows you the lipid classifications and specific therapeutic recommendations of the ATP III based on the lipid panel and risk factors.  You can tap a recommendation to view further information.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids includes a complete Framingham Cardiac Risk calculator which is automatically presented for use if the patient's risk factors indicate a need to evaluate the hard 10-year cardiac risk.\r\n\r\nThe info button at the top-right displays the ATP III algorithm and reference tables in textual form (the Quick Desk Reference on which the ATP3 Lipids therapeutic recommendations are based).  Tapping the 'Show Full Report' button from the info screen switches to the complete 284 page ATP III final report.\r\n\r\nATP3 Lipids keeps track of the last information you entered and restores it when launched, with a Clear button easily accessible to begin working up the next patient.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n • ATP III based, patient-specific cholesterol goals\r\n • ATP III based, patient-specific therapeutic recommendations\r\n • Lipid lowering drug reference, with dosing, expected lipid effects, side effects, and contraindications\r\n • Metabolic syndrome reference, with criteria and recommendations\r\n • Both executive summary and complete text of the ATP III report included\r\n • Support for US and SI units\r\n\r\nIf you love the program, please leave a review. If you have comments, suggestions, or questions, please contact me directly at support@atp3lipids.com as it's not possible to respond to reviews."

      "label": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏"

      "label": "Blood calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis are important health issues. The consequences of abnormal levels are often life-changing and occasionally life-threatening. Using this app is the equivalent to spending hours with the world’s most experienced doctors teaching you about your calcium, parathyroid, osteoporosis, and vitamin D issues. Your tests results are analyzed to determine if a problem exists, what risks are associated, and what to do about it. Beautiful graphs make understanding these problems simple!\n\nBlood tests and bone density scans can be difficult to interpret—even many doctors do not diagnose calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid problems correctly or timely. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease that affects 1 in 800 people and 1 in 250 women over 50 and is very often overlooked while patients suffer from chronic fatigue, memory loss, depression, osteoporosis, bone pain and many other symptoms. Calcium Pro is a powerful software program that will analyze your calcium health and provide you guidance about the status of your bones, kidneys, parathyroid glands, vitamin D, and other related health issues.\n\nYou start by entering your test results for calcium, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D. Then we look at your bone density (osteoporosis levels). CalciumPro will analyze and graph your tests making them easy to understand. It will let you know the status of your parathyroid glands and your chance of having hyperparathyroidism. Suggested next steps are given. Tracking tools will show your calcium and vitamin D levels over time, and will show if your bones are losing density (worsening osteoporosis), or gaining bone density. There are important learning tools on every page, and an extensive video and reading library at the end. The app will provide guidance about talking to your physician regarding the possible need for surgery and other important steps.\n\nA Risk Assessment Tool shows your relative risk for conditions associated with high blood calcium: Osteoporosis, Heart Disease, Heart Arrhythmias and Palpitations, High Blood Pressure, Kidney Stones and Kidney Failure, GERD, several Cancers, and others. Watch your risk assessment graphs change as you address your calcium problems. \n\nThis app was developed by doctors at the Norman Parathyroid Center, the world’s leading parathyroid and calcium treatment center using over 4,000,000 data points from over 30,000 patients. Let the world’s leading doctors help you understand these problems so you and your doctor can make important, informed decisions. Take control of your own health!"

Learn to read chest X-rays in no time and discover the most frequent diagnoses through multiple fully annotated examples.\n\nRealWorld Radiology currently features more than 70 real-world cases (with more coming for free every month!) each containing: \n- High-resolution X-rays \n- All appropriate series (posterioranterior, lateral, expiratory, etc.) \n- Clinical information regarding the patient and mode of presentation\n- Detailed radiologic interpretation\n- Drawings of every radiological finding right on the X-ray \n\nOur cases have been especially selected for their high pedagogical value and real-world representativeness. They can be classified either by diagnosis (e.g. pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrosis) or by actual radiological finding (e.g. alveolar opacities, interstitial opacities, silhouette sign), making the learning of the differential diagnosis easier than ever while keeping each case easy to find for quick access.\n\nTest your knowledge with the Quiz mode and check if what you see matches the radiologist's findings.\n\nAll in all, RealWorld Radiology is your ideal reference for example-based learning or quick on-the-spot study while waiting for your attending."

The information is maintained for one year and is presented in reverse chronological order grouped by day, so the latest data is presented first in the list. Editing allows for: 1) changing the number of servings; 2) changing the date; and 3) deleting records. Individual Intake Items can be copied to the current day, and all Intake Items for a single day can be copied to the current day.\n\nIf you are working towards healthy eating, knowing the amount of cholesterol in the foods available for consumption can be extremely helpful.\n\nThe iCholesterol app provides information about foods and how they are rated for content of dietary cholesterol. This is provided as a means to assist in deciding which foods to eat. The food servings are rated from EXTREMELY LOW in cholesterol all the way up to EXTREMELY HIGH. The following colors help readily identify which is which:\n\n- Black = Rated EXTREMELY HIGH in Cholesterol (151 - 641 mg)\n- Dark Red = Rated VERY HIGH in Cholesterol (81 - 150 mg)\n- Red = Rated HIGH in Cholesterol (51 - 80 mg)\n- Orange = Rated MODERATELY HIGH in Cholesterol (31 - 50 mg)\n- Yellow = Rated MODERATE in Cholesterol (21 - 30 mg)\n- Light Green = Rated MODERATELY LOW in Cholesterol (11 - 20 mg)\n- Green = Rated LOW in Cholesterol (6 - 10 mg)\n- Cyan = Rated VERY LOW in Cholesterol (1 - 5 mg)\n- White = Rated EXTREMELY LOW in Cholesterol (0 mg)\n\nEssentially, the cooler the color, the lower the amount of Cholesterol, with white being the coolest color and black being the hottest (think burnt).\n\nThere are eight tables listing food servings: \n\n- All Foods \n- Fast Foods\n- Fruits & Vegetables \n- Meat, Fish & Shellfish\n- Dairy & Egg\n- Cereal Grains & Pasta\n- Sweets\n- Snacks\n\nThe All Foods list allows you to search by any word or partial word from all the Food Titles. \n\nSelecting a food in any of the tables will display pertinent information about the selected food serving:\n\n- Food Title\n- Weight (in grams)\n- Common Measure (serving size for weight)\n- Cholesterol Content (in milligrams)\n- Calories\n- USDA Description\n- USDA Food Group\n- USDA Nutrient Database Number\n\nInformation is derived from the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference: Cholesterol Content of Selected Foods per Common Measure. There are currently over 1,100 different foods included, searchable using more than 2,500 names (some foods are known by different names or how they are prepared, e.g., \"Egg, Scrambled\" and \"Scrambled Egg\"). A few these have as many as six searchable names.\n\nThe iCholesterol Info screen provides access to additional information pages:\n- What is Cholesterol?\n- Cholesterol in Foods\n- Highest Cholesterol Foods\n- How to Use this App\n- Access My Records\n- iNutrients Custom Food Definitions (another app with more features and data for 10 nutrients)\n- Other Important Info. (includes allowance to 1) Report a Problem; 2) Ask a Questions; and 3) Make a Suggestion)\n\nIf you are experiencing difficulties with the app, please report the problems to the developer directly via james@hollender.com before giving negative feedback. Some errors during loading are beyond our control. In one instance it was deemed to have occurred because the iPhone was jail-broken. The user was able to get the app functioning properly, but only on a non jail-broken device."

It provides fast, easy access to vital assessment information, medications, and drug doses; quick interpretation of 12-Lead EKGs; and the latest CPR and ACLS algorithms from the American Heart Association (AHA). The ALS app is also suitable for Intermediates whose practice orders require a more detailed understanding of these topics. \n\nREVIEWS\n\n“The EMS Field Guide by Informed is probably the most popular pocket reference guide carried on ambulances across the country.”\n\n“I love your guides. I’ve been a paramedic for 25 years and your ALS guides are the best source of reliable on-scene information.”\n\n“This is a great review tool as well as a resource.”\n\n“…Highly recommended in some of my advanced cardiac life support training courses.”\n\n“One of the best things a paramedic can have. A cheat sheet for the things you may not always remember.”\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nInformed Publishing offers a full product line of references for the medical and first response markets, as well as a consumer line for home and family emergency preparedness.

The videos and information are all accessed from within the app with no connection to the internet required. \n \n(*Internet access is required for links accessed from within the app and tertiary video content.)\n\nA unique system that combines live sonoanatomy via ultrasound scans, 3D animated anatomy and real time video of the performance of regional anaesthetic nerve blocks. All elements are combined and synchronised with audible narration.\n\n* Full length offline demonstrations of many regional anaesthetic techniques.\n\n* Insertion of a Pajunk E-Cath (CPNB)\n\n* A video guide to the Pajunk E-Cath, including setting up of the system, insertion and fixation.\n\n* 3D Animated anatomical models, interlinked with live ultrasound scans.\n\n* Synchronised (US and camera) nerve mapping scans.\n\n* Visualise a whole block from start to finish.\n\n* Clear narration during the procedure.\n\n* A source of tips and advice which we wished had been around when we started using ultrasound. \n\n* Easy accessed tabs for Anatomy, Procedure and Tips.\n\n* Stunning full screen diagrams.\n\n* Annotated ultrasound screen shots.\n\n* Fantastic for the novice or experienced anaesthesia provider.\n\n* Learning tool for ODP’s, ODA’s, Anaesthetic nurses, PA(A)’s, AA’s, CRNA’s and all staff working within regional anaesthesia.\n\n* Medical students can gain a better insight into regional anaesthesia.\n\nA tab system gives the user access to anatomy, procedure, tips and equipment. The anatomy tab gives an overview of anatomy related to the specific block, it includes schematic diagram’s which can be expanded to full screen. The procedures tab is a full pictorial and text guide to the performance of the specific block, including annotated ultrasound screen captures to help visualise nerves. The tips tab contains useful advice related to the selected block, also included is advice on the use of ultrasound and local anaesthetics.\n\nA must have app for both junior and senior anaesthetic staff as well as practitioners working within regional anaesthesia.\n\nThe blocks are:\n\nInterscalene & Mapping\nSupraclavicular & Mapping\nInfraclavicular\nAxillary x 2 & Mapping\nRadial Nerve & Mapping\nMedian Nerve & Mapping\nUlnar Nerve & Mapping\nTAP\nFemoral Nerve & CPNB\nSaphenous Nerve\nPopliteal Sciatic\nPECS1\nPECS2\nPECS1 and 2 combined\nSerratus anterior\n\nDedicated nerve mapping videos now make orientating yourself with anatomy even easier. Using demonstrator video interlinked with annotated live ultrasound scanning can help you to locate and track nerves and other relevant anatomy. (The nerve mapping videos will be available as online content to cut down on the size of the app, an internet connection will be required to access these.)More blocks will be added to this app, contact us to let us know what you would like to see in future updates.\n\nwww.raguru.com\n\nThis App is exactly what it says it is - it’s a guide. It doesn’t set out to replace a standard text book. It certainly isn’t a substitute for a sound knowledge of anatomy and local anaesthetic pharmacology. It’s more of a guide to the occasional blocker, a refresher to the more experienced, and a teaching aid to the trainer. \n\nWe are a busy hospital with a heavy teaching commitment. Therefore we choose to use nerve stimulation in conjunction with ultrasound as we feel it adds another layer of safety to the patient, and reassurance to the operator."

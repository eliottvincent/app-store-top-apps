For anyone looking to curtail their phone usage, the Forest app might be for you.\"— Business Insider\n\nIf you want to temporarily put down your phone and focus on what’s more important in real life, you can plant a seed in Forest. As time goes by, this seed will gradually grow into a tree. However, if you cannot resist the temptation of using your phone and leave the app, your tree will wither. \n\nThe sense of achievement and responsibility will encourage you to stay away from your phone, and will help you make better use of your time. Stop getting distracted by your phone, make you self-motivated and get more things done.\n\nStay focused. Be present! \n\nSTAY FOCUSED\n• A interesting way to help you beat phone addiction and overcome distraction\n• Turn your focused moments into a lush forest.\n\nGET MOTIVATED\n• Earn rewards and unlock more than 50 new tree species and white noises.\n• Share your forest and compete with friends and users around the world.\n• Plant trees along with friends & family.\n• Unlock achievements and earn extra rewards.\n• Plant real trees on Earth and protect the environment with tree-planting organization Trees for the Future.\n\nSTATISTICS\n• Manage your own tags and view detailed statistics of your time distribution.\n• Browse your weekly, monthly and even your yearly big forest.\n• Track your focused time in the Apple Health App.\n• Track your daily phone usage and screen time.\n• Recall memories of your planting journey with our brand new Forest Timeline!\n\nIt's never to late to build up productive habits! \n\nNOTICE\n• Forest is an app available for both iPhone and iPad, and can be accessed across all iOS devices with a one-time purchase. To download or unlock non iOS version of Forest, this requires a separate purchase. However, by logging into the same account, the account data can be synchronized across all platforms.\n• Due to budget constraint, the number of real trees each user can plant is limited to five. We will be introducing limited time events that will allow users to plant more real trees. Please follow our social media page or check the in-app announcement for more updates.\n• There is only one version of Forest on the App Store. Other apps that are similar and mimics Forest are not developed by the Forest team.

You can add notes, tag it, schedule it, and break it down into smaller steps.\n\n• Your Projects\nCreate a Project for any big goal, then add the to-dos to reach it. Use headings to structure your list as you outline your plan. There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on. This keeps everything neatly organized, and helps you see the big picture as you set your plans in motion.\n\n• Your Plan\nEverything on your schedule is neatly laid out in the Today and Upcoming lists, which show your to-dos and calendar events. Each morning, see what you planned for Today and decide what you want to do. The rest is down to you :)\n\n\nMORE THINGS TO LOVE\n\nAs you dive deeper, you’ll find Things packed with helpful features.

A great example is the Share extension, which allows you to create to-dos with content from other apps, such as a link to a website you want to get back to.\n\nYou can also enjoy a beautiful dark mode at sunset, connect your calendars, add widgets to your home screen, create to-dos via Siri, import from Reminders—Things can do it all! There’s even Shortcuts integration if you want to automate your workflows.\n\n\nMADE FOR APPLE WATCH\n\nThings comes with a great app for Apple Watch. Just raise your wrist to glance at your Today list, mark to-dos complete as you go, and dictate new ones on the fly—all synced instantly with your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\n\nAWARD-WINNING DESIGN\n\nMade in Stuttgart, with two Apple Design Awards to its name, Things is a fine example of German engineering: designed not only to look fantastic, but to be perfectly functional as well. Every detail is thoughtfully considered, then polished to perfection.\n\n“It’s like the unicorn of productivity tools: deep enough for serious work, surprisingly easy to use, and gorgeous enough to enjoy staring at.”\n—Apple\n\n\nGET THINGS TODAY\n\nWhatever it is you want to accomplish in life, Things can help you get there.

      "label": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase."

      "label": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4, that very same app in 2022 is now optimized for iPhone 14 Pro Max running iOS 16. It even works on devices that didn't exist back then, such as the iPad Pro and the Apple Watch.\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later."

      "label": "LockBox Pro lets you store and protect sensitive info such as credit card numbers, bank accounts, passwords, pin numbers, private notes, and any other secret information on your iPhone or iPod Touch.\n\nNow supports ios11\n\nNEW Version v1.2 fixes a bug that sometimes causes imports to fail or only import partial data. Thanks to everyone who reported this and helped us fix it!!\n\nNEW Version 1.1 allows you to:\n\n- NEW! Import Bulk Data from your computer into LockBox Pro.  Saves lots of typing on your device!\n\n- NEW! Export/Backup data to your computer over a WiFi connection! Remember to do this regularly!\n\n- NO Ads!\n\nUse it to keep information handy and also protected at the same time.\n\nNew Pro Edition Features:\n(not found in the free version)\n\n* Import Data - create a file on your computer and import it into LockBox Pro via Wifi.  Saves you lots of typing on the device.\n\n* Stronger Security - data is secured via Apple's Keychain which utilizes 3DES encryption for high security.\n\n* More Flexible - you can add as many fields as you like to each entry. (the free version is fixed at 2 fields per entry)\n\n* No Ads\n\nIMPORTANT:\nExisting free version users... you can now upgrade easily while keeping your data!  Just export your data first using the free version and then import it into LockBox Pro via the WiFi import feature.\n\nNew Features:\n\n* import/export via WiFi \n* Sound effects can now be turned off! :-)\n* The app exits correctly when you lock your iPhone with the top button.\n* You can now easily rearrange and delete items in your list. (and they stay rearranged)\n* Your data is backed up via the regular iTunes backup, but be sure to use the new export feature as data is sometimes saved incorrectly in iTunes. iTunes also does not allow you to change devices... your data will be lost if you don't back it up using the new WiFi export method.\n\n(all bug fixes are available in the free version as well... however the new advanced features are not)\n\nMore Info:\n\nAll data is encrypted and protected by your secret code, so only you have access to it, even if you let your friends borrow your phone to make a call or browse online.\n\nThis is the kind of information that you want easy access to while you are on the go, but find it hard to recall just when you need it.  For example, I always forget my bank account number right when I need to deposit a check at the bank.\n\nNot sure if you need this?\n\nTry the FREE version first... it's called LockBox (not Pro) :-)\n\nGo Pro for a low price for a limited time!  \n\nIMPORTANT BACKUP INFORMATION: \n\nRemember to sync and do a backup of your data through the LockBox app before updating to newer versions!  You never know what might happen to your phone in the middle of a sync :-)  Also, the iTunes backup is not enough in some cases especially when you have to replace your phone or reset it, so make sure you use the WiFi backup method to protect your data.  Its the only way to make sure your data is safe when doing a sync or restore for your device."

It's just like working with the real circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!\n\nThere are over 70 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from a programmable Arduino, to simple resistors, to switches, to MOSFETS, to digital gates.\n\nThe app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals. The scope can also display the Fourier transform of any signal so that you can see the performance of filters.\n\nSupported elements include:\n\n• Programmable Arduino using a subset of the C programming language\n• Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources\n• Resistors, Capacitors, and Inductors\n• Manual SPST/SPDT and DPST/DPDT Switches, Push buttons, and Relays\n• LEDs, Diodes, BJ Transistors, and MOSFETs\n• Audio simulation with Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs\n• ADCs, and DACs\n• Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR\n• JK and D Flip-flops\n• 38 7400 series digital parts \n• 78xx and LM317 voltage regulators\n• 7-segment display and driver\n• Antenna with simulated AM and FM signals\n\nYou can also create sub circuits to introduce new elements and componentize your designs.\n\nNo matter your skill set, you'll be playing with circuits in no time with iCircuit."

      "label": "TaskTask is the easiest way to get your Outlook or Gmail tasks onto your iPhone! TaskTask directly connects with your Office 365 Business, Exchange on-premises, or Google tasks to keep your full task list in sync between Outlook and your device. Everything is tracked, include all the advanced properties you can see in Outlook. Best of all TaskTask includes flagged items (email!) so you can see your complete task list on the go.\n\nUsing TaskTask, you can manage your to-do list, create tasks, set start/due dates, mark complete, assigning categories, change importance, set and receive reminders, and delete tasks. An Exchange Server or Office 365 account is required to synchronized tasks with Outlook. No additional software is necessary. TaskTask works with Gmail directly, although in a limited fashion.\n\nKey Features:\n- Simple interface, quickly create new tasks and mark tasks completed\n- Set task attributes, such as category, importance, start/due/complete dates, and notes\n- Synchronize your task list with your e-mail account (no hidden fees or software to download)\n- Quickly swipe to complete or delete a task \n- Easy set up with automatic configuration of your server\n- Drag-to-order your tasks, see the same order in Outlook\n- Recurring tasks and reminders\n- View attachments on your tasks and attach files from other apps\n\nHow is TaskTask better than Reminders?\n- See your task list how you prefer: organize by start date, due date, category, importance, or reminder date.\n- Reorder your tasks just by dragging them around\n- Full category support, including downloading your list of categories and colors from your Exchange Server.\n- See tasks in the same order as Outlook's To Do Bar\n- Task filters: filter out tasks in the future or tasks you don't want to see on your mobile device\n- Flagged mail items: See the full list of items from your To Do Bar, not just tasks\n- Quick Task Entry: Type a list of task subjects quickly in one space, and TaskTask automatically creates the set of tasks\n- Mark tasks as private: Hide tasks from others who have visibility to your task list\n\nNote: To synchronize your tasks with Outlook, your email account must be on a compatible Microsoft Exchange Server or Office 365 Business account. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and newer versions are supported, although there may be additional factors that prevent TaskTask from working with your server. \n\nIf you are using Mail.app or Microsoft Outlook 2011 (Macintosh) with your email account in \"Exchange\" mode, TaskTask is compatible with your server. Because there are specific requirements for your server, please verify with your e-mail administrator that your server meets these requirements before purchasing this app."

      "label": "Jotter is the most appropriate tool to write a note on an iPhone or an iPad.\n\nJotter is like a notebook. You can easily write something quickly or draw a simple diagram with Jotter conveniently. Instead of a notebook, you can use Jotter to write or draw your idea in a quick, easy and convenient way. Jotter is acting like a real notebook. The size of you device is the size of your notebook, which will rotate automatically as you rotate the device, so what you see is what you get. If you want to use it in portrait mode, you can lay the device lengthwise. If you want to use it in landscape mode, you can lay your device widthwise.\n\nJotter provides three note lists: ‘My Notes’ list to manage note prepared on the device; ‘Favorites’ list showing notes designated as favorites; and iCloud list showing notes on iCloud. You can edit notes on ‘My Notes’ list and upload them to iCloud, if you have an iCloud account. You can change the type of a list by swiping the list view left or right.\n\nYou can use Jotter on all iOS devices (iPhone and iPad). If you have several devices, you can share your notes on all devices via iCloud.\n\n\nHandwriting\n• Provide a variable-width pen optimized for handwriting: if you write fast, the pen width becomes thinner, and vice versa. You can also use a fixed-width pen.\n• Provide a highlighter with which you can draw a translucent line over text.\n• Provide a zoom-in window, with which you can enter much more content on a limited space. It will also support you to write text more comfortably.\n• When writing on the zoom-in window, the window will move automatically to write without additional control. When you reach the right margin of the page, it will automatically move to the next line.\n• The zoom-in window supports both text directions: right-to-left and left-to-right.\n\niCloud\n• As notes made on several devices are stored in an iCloud stream, you can see all the notes on each device.\n• You can download a note to your device among notes stored in the iCloud stream. You can edit the downloaded note, and share it with other devices via iCloud.\n• For notes with different sizes (made on other devices), you can change the size and position of the notes when opening them.\n\nShare\n• You can send a note to other people via email as a JPEG or PNG file.\n• You can upload a note on SMS by using Copy function. Copy your content and paste it on a SMS window, then it will be sent to SMS.\n• You can store notes in My Photo list.\n• You can send your notes to your Twitter account set on your device.\n• You can send your notes to your Facebook account set on your device, or upload them by logging in Facebook.\n• You can send a note to other apps as a PDF file by using ‘Open with other app’ function.\n• Jotter will send an image as you can see on the screen. If you want to share a portrait image, lay the device widthwise and share the image. If you want to share a landscape image, lay the device lengthwise and share the image."

There is no centralized (shared) storage space on your device. This means that this app's proprietary printing engine only works within this app. To say it another way: the iOS does not support/allow third party system-wide drivers. The iOS cannot use this app to print files within another app's storage space—for example, files stored in Pages, Numbers, Safari, Notes, Mail, etc. Therefore, files created in other apps must be imported into this app.\n\n\nHOW DO I IMPORT FILES INTO THIS APP?\n    • Use a web browser to transfer files between your computer and this app.\n    • Use iTunes to upload files into this app.\n    • Use a WebDAV server to transfer files.\n    • Email a file to yourself.

      "label": "CalenGoo gives you a fast and easy way to access and modify your Google Calendar with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. It can also be used when you have no Internet connection, using the cached data. Changes are saved and uploaded the next time you are connected.\n\nThe calendar view is similar to the web view of Google Calendar. Events are displayed using the same calendar colors that you use in your Google Calendar, even Google's event colors are supported (please see http://www.calengoo.com/cc ). It also recognizes which calendars are visible and which are hidden. So the view should match the view of your Google Calendar as much as possible. \n\nCalenGoo also has a month view similar to that of Google Calendar. It can be zoomed and panned to quickly get an overview over the events of a month. Zooming the month is done by using the two-finger-zoom gesture that you know from Safari and the photo application. A double tap opens the tapped day.\n\nIt also supports the same kinds of recurrence rules as Google Calendar and displays recurring events correctly even when you are offline or scroll far into the future.\n\nYou can also use Google Calendar's feature to invite people to events and see their status (accepted, declined, maybe, no answer). They will get an invitation email with links to e.g. accept or decline the invitation.\n\nGoogle Calendar has an integrated task list, called Google Tasks. Tasks with a due date are displayed on the corresponding days of the calendar. CalenGoo can do the same, it can sync this list, display your tasks in the calendar views and in a list view and it even makes your tasks available offline. You can edit and add tasks and the changes will be synced with Google Tasks.\n\nYou either need a (free) Google Calendar account to use this app or you can use it with your iOS calendars. However using it with Google Calendar has a few advantages.\n\nTo get more information, screenshots and a tutorial, please go to http://www.calengoo.com\n\nIf you have any problems or suggestions, please send an email to calengoo@dgunia.de or take a look at CalenGoo's support website to get help.\n\nIf you think the font is too small and hard to read, you can increase the font size of all calendar views in the settings under \"Settings\", \"Display and Use\".\n\nFeatures ( http://www.calengoo.com ):\n\n- Drag&drop to quickly copy and move events\n- Templates to quickly create similar events again. They can even be combined, e.g. one template for the location of an event and another for the attendees\n- Print/PDF function to print the day, week, month or agenda view via AirPrint or to email it as a PDF file\n- Supports the same recurrence rules as Google Calendar\n- Supports Google Calendar's event colors when syncing via OAuth2\n- Icons can be assigned to Google Calendar events\n- Date/time can be entered using the iOS wheels or by using a keypad\n- Fast search function\n- Show/edit iOS calendars in addition to Google calendars (or instead of Google calendars)\n- Sync with Google Tasks and iOS Reminders\n- Reminders can be snoozed and they can be (optionally) repeated every minute\n- Birthdays and anniversaries of your contacts can be displayed\n- Zoomable month view, which can be configured to scroll horizontally (month by month) or vertically (week by week)\n- Events can be linked to contacts\n- Floating events and completable events\n- Photos and PDF files can be created and attached to events (via Google Drive)\n- Calendar selection bar to quickly show and hide single calendars\n- The location of an event can be opened with Apple Maps, Google Maps, Navigon, TomTom, Skobbler, Sygic, iGo or Waze\n- View/edit calendars that are shared with others via Google Calendar\n- Many configuration options to change the way the app looks and works"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "One of the basic principles of Clay Target shooting is the process of first visualising and then physically re-creating what you've seen in your mind's eye. In Olympic Trap we don't know the direction of the target but we know the scheme. Confidence can be enhanced by mentally walk through the scheme before you step on the shooting range using this App. \n\nThis App contains the nine ISSF Olympic Trap tables so that you can accustom to the angles and elevations that you'll experience on the shooting range.\n\nThe App can also be used as shooting game. The target can be shot by swing through with your finger through the flying target. For a more realistic experience, the App uses real life shooting range changing background.\n\nBenefits:-\n\n    1)Faster target acquisition.\n    2)Improve target recognition on dark green backgrounds.\n    3)If projected on a wall, it can be used for dry fire training.\n    4)Improve clay target mental imagery and visualisation.\n    5)Enhance confidence and preparation.\n    6)Enhance Eye-Hand coordination.\n\n\nFeatures:-\n\n    1)Contains the nine ISSF Schemes.\n    2)Target can be shot using a swing through with tip of finger.\n    3)You can have two shots at a clay with shotgun sound.\n    4)25 targets are thrown as per real life situation.\n    5)Target Speed can be adjusted from 0.6 sec to 10 sec.\n    6)Target to target delay can be adjusted from 0 to 15 sec. \n    7)Three real life shooting range backgrounds for a realistic experience.\n    8)Target breaks on hit.\n    9)Available for the iPhone and the iPad.\n    10) Chose between Competition mode ( our of 25), Show Scheme or 2017 ISSF Final format ( 50 targets).\n    11) Supports acoustic control  so you can call for the target using your voice.\n    12) Compete online on the Apple Game Center. You can tap into the leaderboards which will show your rank against your friends.\n13) Apple Watch App \n\n\"Great app for getting you ready for the round. Even small things can help you reach the top of the game. With this you can read the targets better and you will be ready for all schemas!\" - David Kostelecký, Beijing 2008 Olympic Gold Medalist."

      "label": "Dive Log is designed to work either as your primary SCUBA diving logbook application or in conjunction with compatible 3rd party desktop logbook applications. You can use Dive Log at the dive site or on the dive boat to capture the information about the site while it is fresh in your mind (or your dive guide's mind). You can even capture the GPS coordinates of the dive site using the built in location services of your iOS device. Details about your actual dive can be added immediately after your dive or at the après dive event and later be saved to your desktop computer. The dive buddy feature is fully integrated with Contacts on your iPhone or iPad, letting you capture information about your newest dive buddy or quickly add an existing buddy to a particular dive. The dive data and statistics features let you have an immediate answer the next time your dive guide asks how much weight you used on your last dive or have all the information you need about your dive history when you fill out that next dive waiver.  Metric and Imperial values are supported for all appropriate logbook fields. You can easily enter values using the appropriate units for the situation and view them in your preferred measurement system. You can even explore detailed dive profiles from popular dive computers that you download with your desktop software and later upload to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad. Dive profile data can also be transferred directly from certain dive computers directly via Bluetooth or using a supported Bluetooth accessory and an associated in-app purchase.  \n\nOn Windows, Diving Log 6.0 (www.divinglog.de) is fully integrated with Dive Log on iPhone/iPad and has built in synchronization. Diving Log 6.0 has extensive support for importing data from dive computers and other dive log applications. \n\nOn Mac OS X, logbook information can be imported to Dive Log on iPhone/iPad from a number of compatible applications using the free Dive Log Manager application available from More Mobile Software (www.moremobilesoftware.com/divelog-sync). Dive Log DT (available on the Mac App Store) can be used to directly import a number of dive computers and file formats and can synchronize with Dive Log on iOS.\n\nDive data can be directly downloaded on a Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch from Bluetooth LE capable dive computers such as the Suunto EON Steel, Suunto EON Core, Suunto D5, Scubapro Galileo 2 (G2), Aladin Sport (Matrix), Aladin H (Matrix), G2 HUD, Aladin A1, Shearwater Teric, Peregrine, Petrel 2, Perdix, Perdix AI, NERD 2, Oceanic VTX, Pro Plus 4, Geo 4.0, VEO 4.0, Aeris A300CS, Aqualung i300C, i550C, i750TC, i770R, Sherwood Wisdom 4, Mares Genius and certain heinrichs weikamp OSTC computers as well as the DiveNav Inc. bluebuddy and Tech Buddy dive logger accessories. Supported Bluetooth LE accessories are available separately.\n\nMares Bluelink Pro is a Bluetooth LE accessory by Mares and available for purchase separately (www.mares.com). The Bluelink Pro allows you transfer dive data from certain Mares dive computers (Puck Pro, Smart, Smart Air, Quad and Quad Air) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nDive Computer Buddy (aka DCbuddy) is a Bluetooth LE accessory by DiveNav Inc. (note that the DCbuddy itself is no longer available). The DCbuddy allows you transfer dive data from certain dive computers (including models from Suunto, Oceanic, Aqualung, Aeris, Sherwood, Tusa and Mares) directly to Dive Log on your Bluetooth LE (Bluetooth 4.0) compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch."

In addition, this tab lets do a fine tunning adjustment for the high and low needles to adapt to the concrete engine. \n\n- Weather: In the second tab, called Weather, you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: You must set in this screen the information about the engine, that is, the engine type (Leopard, X30 Senior, X30 Junior X30 Super), carburetor, exhaust restrictions (for Junior engines), the oil mix ratio and the type of the circuit (short or long tracks). Depending of the track type, the jetting setups will be adapted.\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity). \n\nThe application works with different measure units: inHg, mb, mmHg, hPa, atm for pressure, ºC and ºF for temperature."

      "label": "Trimix blending and planning tools that can be used where you are and when you need them.\n\nYou can use these tools to plan your mixes prior to arriving at the dive shop or to fill your cylinder at the air station or on the boat. Calculations are provided for the best Trimix given a planned depth and a desired maximum partial pressure of oxygen and equivalent narcotic depth (END). You can also calculate the ceiling and maximum depths along with your END based on your planned mix. The dive planning tools support both salt water and fresh water calculations. The blending tools provide for filling a cylinder with a remaining mix (or empty) to a specified target mix using oxygen, helium and a topping mix (air or another available mix). You can also calculate the result of topping an existing partially filled cylinder with a specific topping mix (air or another available mix). There is also a Bleed Down calculator that allows you adjust an existing full or partially full cylinder to a new mix with minimal wasted gas. Trimix Tools supports calculations in both metric and Imperial/US systems of measure.\n\nTraveling on a boat or working out of network range? These tools are at hand any time you have your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. You could, for example, easily calculate the result of topping your cylinder from your first dive with air from the boat's compressor to take advantage of any remaining mix. You also have the convenience of saved settings that you can recall at a touch and adjust to a new situation as needed.\n\nChances are you regularly work with a specific set of mixes and common dive situations. Trimix Tools includes the convenience of saved settings that you can recall and adjust to a new situation as needed. You can also select mix values using pre-installed default mixes or your own saved custom mixes. When updating one of the mixes for a tool you are offered a list of saved mixes that you can use directly or adjust as needed. You can save the currently displayed mix by tapping on the \"+\" button. Just like with the saved calculations, you can re-arrange or delete any mixes in your saved list.\n\nDo you need to share your planning or blending calculations with other divers? All the tools have the ability to share the results of the calculations from within the application. You can set default email addresses and a subject Trimix Tool's settings that will be automatically added when you share a result.\n\nAll END calculations (Dive Planning and Best Trimix tabs) in Trimix Tools treat oxygen as a narcotic gas by default. There is an option available under the Settings tab to change the default so that oxygen is not treated as narcotic if that is your preference. Remember you must always personally analyze your mix before diving it.\n\nThis application is not a substitute for proper training and should not be used as a substitute for proper dive planning or the primary Trimix blending and planning methods taught during training. Please do not attempt to handle high pressure oxygen or fill SCUBA cylinders without proper training."

      "label": "Dive Plan is a digital decompression table and log book, made using general public information, most compatible with PADI, SSI, SDI, NAUI, NAVI diving tables, and it is comparable with most of the other current diving organizations and their dive tables. Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

      "label": "This nice little tool - a must have for every paraglider pilot - emulates a variometer on your iPhone. \n\nSince version 3.0 the app supports iOS9, as well as the pressure sensor of your iPhone 6(s) or iPhone  6(s) Plus. \n\nTherefore your iPhone is a complete replacement for a \"real\" variometer. \n\nIn conjunction with an external sensor such as ASI FlyNet2, FlyTec SenseBox or the XC-TRacer, the app provides even more precise climb- and sink-rates. \n\nYou can use it to measure\n\n    - climb/decline rate\n    - absolute altitude\n    - hight over ground\n    - relative height\n    - speed over ground and\n    - course\n\nValues ​​displayed in meters or feet/kn.\n\nThe current climb- or sink-rate is signaled via different \"beep\" sounds, as usual for a variometer. \n\nYou can watch your flight using the integrated map view in real time, so you will never loose your orientation. Even if your are flying accidentally within a cloud or under poor visibility conditions!\n\nBy typing to „Alt 3“ - usually after the adjusting phase - or any time later you can reset „Alt 3“ to „0“.\n\nMoreover you can use the App to\n\n    - record you flights \n    - view your recorded flights in the integrated map view  \n    - send your recorded flights by mail as kml-files or gpx -files to your friends \n    \nOne last note: \nThe app reacts a little somewhat slower, as e.g. a Bräuninger- or Flytec Vario, if you use the internal pressure sensor of the iPhone, because the sensor doesn't provide data as often as an external sensor. \n\nThe app requires a good GPS signal, if no internal or external pressure sensor can be used. \n\nPlease make sure in any case, that you have a good GPS signal,  if you use the app. \nThe app does NOT work - completely and reliably - in buildings or other situations in which you have no or a bad GPS signal! \nHowever, this should not be a problem, since you usually flying under a clear open sky. ;-) \n\nUsage - without - an internal or external sensor is possible, but subject to known the limitations of a pure GPS operation, such as using only open-air, a good GPS signal and altitude changes > 5m with at least 1-2 m/s. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\nEven if the App is running in background, the GPS location service is used by the App, if you record your flight!"

      "label": "Blackjack Card Counter is a unique application for the iPhone and iPad.  Beware of imitations this is the original.\n\nIt allows any blackjack player, professional or amateur to keep track of their card count.\n\n** True Count **\n\nBlackjack Card Counter calculates the \"True Count\" for you and does it more accurately than manual methods.  As buttons are pressed in the app the total counted cards are recorded.  This is then adjusted to take into account cards that aren't recorded.  A “total cards dealt” number is determined which is then divided by 52 to represent total decks dealt.  This number is then used in the \"True Count\" calculation.\n\nYou can adjust the number of decks in the shoe by going to the info screen.\n\n** Card Counting Methods **\n\nFor each strategy press the button that contains the face value of the cards as they are drawn from the deck.  Depending on the strategy and on the value of the card the button will either add or subtract 1 or 2 from the \"Running Count\".\n\nHi-Lo  - Low cards 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (add 1 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q, K and A (subtract 1 from total).\n\nHi-Op  I - Low cards 3, 4, 5, and 6 (add 1 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 1 from total).\n\nHi-Op  II - Low cards 2, 3, 6 and 7 (add 1 to total) 4 and 5 (add 2 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 2 from total).\n\nOmega II - Low cards 2 and 3 (add 1 to total) 4, 5 and 6 (add 2 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 2 from total).\n\nAfter a shuffle the new deck button should be pressed to set the tally back to 0.\n\n** Basic Strategy **\n\nAs most blackjack players know if you stick to the Basic Strategy for blackjack the house has a small advantage.  But if you can keep count of the number of High and Low ranked cards in the pack you can gain a small advantage.  You do this by betting more when there are more High cards still in the deck.  \n\nYou have an advantage when more high cards are in the deck particularly near the end of the shoe.\n\nThis small advantage, around 1%, over a long period of time can result in huge wins.\n\nDisclaimer: This app is intended for home use entertainment purposes only. At many casinos it is deemed illegal to use an electronic device with the intention of gaining an advantage over the casino. By choosing accept you agree not to use this app for illegal purposes.  The developers of this app can not be held responsible for any misuse of this application.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWebtopia is the trading name for Poulet Maison Pty Ltd"

      "label": "This is the original Kart Chassis Setup app (you'll see a fake app in the App Store).\n\nSet up your kart chassis analyzing information like cold and hot tyre pressures, tyre temperatures and behaviour in corners. Using all the data the application will give you some recommendations about how to adjust your chassis in order to resolve any set up problem that you're suffering. For each advice, you'll find an explanation about the adjustment. The explanation usually contains pictures to be more understandable.\n\nThe application is valid for sprint (road) karts and for all classes (adult or senior, cadet, junior). It's usefull for both experienced or novice drivers. For the former, it'll be a second opinion about what's wrong with the chassis setup, and for novices it will teach them the secrets of the chassis adjustments and chassis setup.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Driving: in this tab you'll have to inform about how the driver feels the behaviour of the kart in corners. In the first fields, \"Behaviour in corners\" you'll have to enter the information about what the driver is feeling and in which grade, that is, if it's very noticeable or not. These are the most important information used by the application to calculate the advices. You can enter, in this tab, if the track is clockwise or anti-clockwise, and the current temperature. Both elements are taking into consideration for calculations.\nBesides, you can indicate some information about the driver in order to adjust the calculations for his weight and chassis special features. \n\n- Pressure: in this tab you can inform about the hot and cold pressures of each tyre. \n\n- Temperature: you can set in this screen the information about hot tyre temperatures in the inside, middle and outside of the patch.\n\n- Results: this tab will show you some recommendations related on which adjustments you can do to solve any problem in the chassis setup that you can be suffering. A screen with detailed information about the adjustment will be shown. This explanation is very important in the \"Modify pressures\" advice, because it will show how much you should adjust your pressures.\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, PSI and BAR for pressures, lb and kg for weights."

For this reason, even if it reduce our success percentage, we wanted to serve you almost every league. You will decide which league or which team you want to bet on.\n\n For “1” and “2” predictions, we suggest you to use only first leagues. For second and third leagues, it is more common to see that strong teams loose the match or the match ends in draw. We do not restrict those kind of situations in our application because we want to serve you every single match.\n\n For “Over” and “Under” predictions, we suggest you to prepare one table to determine which league is suitable for “Over” or “Under” betting. For example: Greece first league, Greece second league, Portugal second league, Spain second league are not suitable for “Over” predictions. Do not bet on.\n\n We tried to explain how you are going to use this application, we hope that we succeeded. If you are good at logic and mathematics, than you will use this application more effective and successful. You will use this application more effective day by day. You will even create black list for teams and leagues by time pasing.\n\n Good luck !"

You can use these tools at your air station to provide the information you need to fill a Nitrox tank from any existing mix (or empty). Dive Planning tools provide your Equivalent Air Depth, PPO2 at your planned depth, Maximum & Contingency Operating Depth at various oxygen partial pressures and  the \"best mix\" for a planned depth and oxygen partial pressure.\n\nYou can easily switch between Metric and Imperial/U.S. systems of measurement to adapt to a new fill station. The dive planning tools also support both salt and fresh water calculations.\n\nChances are you regularly work with a specific set of mixes and and common dive situations. Nitrox Tools includes the convenience of saved settings that you can recall at a touch and adjust to a new situation as needed. You can also select mix values using pre-installed default mixes or your own saved custom mixes. When updating one of the mixes for a tool you are offered a list of saved mixes that you can use directly or adjust as needed. You can save the currently displayed mix by clicking the \"+\" button. Just like with the saved calculations, you can re-arrange or delete any mixes in your saved list.\n\nDo you need to share your planning or blending calculations with other divers? All the tools have the ability to share the results of the calculations from within the application. You can set default email addresses and a subject within Nitrox Tool's settings that will be automatically added when you share a result.\n\nNitrox Tools supports a number of blending methods:\n\n• Top Up - blend a final mix from starting mix and pressure using 100% oxygen and air or any available topping mix.\n\n• Bleed Down - save expensive oxygen and valuable time by easily calculating how much gas to bleed from an existing cylinder to switch to a different mix using air or any available topping mix.\n\n• Mix + Mix - make a specific final mix using the remaining gas in the cylinder and mixing that with banked Nitrox (rather than pure oxygen) and air or another topping mix. This enables the blending of Nitrox without the use of pure oxygen for certain combinations of mixes. Avoiding pure oxygen may increase the safety of the blending process and help manage the cost.\n\n• Top Off - determine the expected result from topping an existing cylinder with air or some other topping mix. This situation is common when a diver wants to have the blender top the mix remaining from the first dive with air from the boat's compressor.\n\nRemember you must always personally analyze your mix before diving it.\n\nThis application is not a substitute for proper training and should not be used as a substitute for proper dive planning or the primary Nitrox blending and planning methods taught during training. Please do not attempt to handle high pressure oxygen or fill SCUBA cylinders without proper training."

Aimed at both coaches evaluating multiple athletes and individuals monitoring their performance, the app can be applied to a variety of different tests to measure speed, agility, jumping altitude and overall physical condition.\n\nFitnessMeter includes the following tools: \n\nFlying Sprint \nUsing the camera view, FitnessMeter measures the top speed or acceleration of a sprinter over a predetermined distance of 10-20 m. Two red lines, functioning as timing gates, aid in identifying the points between which running time is measured.\n\nSprint and Shuttle \nThis mode can be applied to both sprints and agility tests. The app functions as a starting gun and a timing gate, and can be configured to handle several different types of tests, from conventional sprint to more complex drills, such as the 505 Agility test. \n\nVertical Jump \nFitnessMeter records a short video that allows you to easily measure the height of a jump. If you are evaluating your​ performance, put the iPhone in your pocket and use the accelerometer tool instead. \n\nRepetitions \nFitnessMeter can count and time various repetitive activities such as sit-ups, push-ups, step-ups, etc. The iPhone can be placed beside you, using the camera to track repetitions using motion detection, or attached to yourself to allow monitoring through the accelerometer.\n\nBeep Test \nA configurable Beep Test that saves an image after each lap, which makes it easy to keep track of results, even for a large group of runners.\n\nSee the demo video at the support url appmaker.se/fitnessMeter\n\n\"A serious must have\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"FitnessMeter is an awesome tool\"\ngreatist.com/fitness/strength-training-iphone-apps\n\n\"Super cool app that measures a whole bunch of fitness related exercises.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com"

      "label": "Listen to your racquet and perfect your game!\n\nRacquetTune ensures that your racquet is ideally suited to your style of play. Simple and straightforward to use, the app uses the sound generated by tapping the strings to calculate the tension with high accuracy. In addition, the interactive swingweight calculator aids in customizing your racquet to fit your own stroke pattern, while the stiffness calculator allows you to simulate different racquet configurations. \n\nRacquetTune not only makes it easier to decide when it is time to restring, it is also an invaluable tool when testing different racquets and strings and in identifying which of your racquets is best suited for different types of games. RacquetTune also allows you to check whether your stringer is consistent in his work. \nRacquetTune includes the following user-friendly tools:\n\nTension measurement \n- Quickly determines the tension and stringbed stiffness. \n- Able to detect changes in tension as small as 0.1 kg/0.2 lb.\n- An accuracy indicator ensures results are consistent. \n- Graphical presentation of sound waves helps you find the ideal way of tapping the strings. \n- Settings can be customized to serve tennis, squash, racquetball and badminton racquets, respectively. \n- View the tension history for each racquet as a list or a graph.\n- Email a spreadsheet with test data.\n\nSwingweight calculator \n- Add as many weights as you wish to the frame. \n- Move and change weights to visualize how swingweight, balance and sweet spot location are affected.\n- Enter target values for the racquet and let RacquetTune distribute the weights automatically.\n\nStiffness calculator \n- Simulate various racquet and string configurations\n- Vary tension, string type and racquet head size. \n- Shows load-displacement curves, stiffness and elastic energies \n- Handles the large deformations encountered in actual play \n\nView a demo video at racquettune.com\n\nRacquetTune has been featured in tennis magazines in USA, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden and Norway. \n\n\"The app is very, very impressive. I get more tension diagnostic questions than just about anybody in the universe, so this is a very good thing to be able to recommend.\" \nJonathan Wolfe \nUS Racquet Stringers Association\n\nNote, that the actual string tension in the racquet and the setting seen on a stringing machine are two different things and therefore incomparable - more information can be found at racquettune.com."

Determining the solunar period is therefore useful for activities such as birdwatching, fishing or hunting. There are two major and two minor solunar periods each day. The time at which each solunar occurs varies depending on the date and on your geographical location.\n\nThe app helps you to determine the solunar period and expected animal activity index (where 6-point is when animals are most active). It also tells you the exact sunrise, sunset, sun transit, moon rise, moon set, and moon transit times, alone with moon phase. The app can utilize your iPhone's build-in GPS to obtain your geographical location. In case you are using iTouch or without GPS signal, the app also accepts user input of longitude and latitude. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n.Locations: GPS or Manual Entry\n.Major & Minor Periods\n.Activity Index\n.Moonrise / Moonset Times\n.Moon Phase Data\n.Sunrise / Sunset Times\n.Sun Transit\n.Moon Transit\n.Day / Week View\n.Any Date\n.Any Location - Worldwide\n\nNo network is needed.

In Olympic Trap we don't know the direction of the target but we know the scheme. Confidence can be enhanced by mentally walk through the scheme before you step on the shooting range using this App. \n\nThis App contains the nine ISSF Olympic Trap tables so that you can accustom to the angles and elevations that you'll experience on the shooting range.\n\nThe target can be shot by using the magnetic input on the Google Cardboard VR. For a more realistic experience, the App uses real life shooting range changing background and shot sound.\n\nBenefits:-\n\n    Faster target acquisition.\n    Improve clay target mental imagery and visualisation.\n    Enhance confidence and preparation.\n    Enhance Eye-Hand coordination. \n    Practice body swing and follow though.\n\n\n\nFeatures:-\n\n    Contains the nine ISSF Schemes.\n    You can have two shots at a clay with shotgun sound.\n    25 targets are thrown as per real life situation.\n    Real life shooting range background and shotgun for a realistic experience.\n   Choice of Beretta or Perazzi shotguns. \n    Target breaks on hit."

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created. With My Jump 2 you can analyze the evolution of your performance during time. You can even observe exactly how much you have improved!\n• Export your data to Excel, Numbers, Google Drive and more!\n• Beautiful, intuitive like design.\n• Universal app: purchase once and install it on your iPhone, iPad and Mac (10.15+)\n \nNote: My Jump 2 works better with slow-motion videos.\n \nMY JUMP 2, A JUMP PLATFORM RIGHT ON YOUR HAND!"

The following carb values are given: main jet, emulsion tube, needle type and clip position, inner pilot jet (iddle diffuser) and outer pilot jet (iddle jet). In addition, this tab lets do a fine tunning adjustment for the main (high) and needle (mid) circuits to adapt to the concrete engine. \n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n- Engine: you should set in this screen the information about the engine and the carburator (Dellorto VHSH 30 / VHSB 36 RD), that is, the engine model (IAME Screamer -1,2 or 3-, X30 Shifter and 175 cc Super Shifter), the float type and height, the oil mix ratio and the type of the circuit (sprint or road racing, short or long). Depending of the track type, the jetting setups will be adapted.\n- GPS: this tab allows to use the GPS to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\nThe application works with different measure units: inHg, mb, mmHg, hPa, atm for pressure, ºC and ºF for temperature."

      "label": "Designed by sports scientists and coaches. Scientifically validated (publication in review in a high-impact journal). \nThe only app that accurately calculates the complete power-force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino et al.´s method (published in 2015). \n\nMy Sprint is the first app scientifically developed to measure the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes. Innovative design, validated by sports scientists, My Sprint is as reliable as a 4000$ radar plus PC system. Scientifically approved!\n\nSprint running, power output and forward acceleration are a key combination of performance in many sports activities. Determining individual Force–Velocity profile, maximal power and mechanical effectiveness during sprint propulsion is of great interest for coaches, sport practitioners, or physiotherapists. What makes you fast?\n\nTheir opinion about My Sprint:\n\n- Dr. Samozino: “One of our main interests is to make accessible to sport practitioners the scientific evaluations we do in our labs with very specific devices. The simple method on which My Sprint is based was developed in this sense to test the sprint mechanical capabilities in field condition. The results of the validation of the method in comparison to force plate measurements were better than those we expected! And the validity of the data obtained with My Sprint is in the same extent… but with an impressive simplicity!”  \n\n- Pr. Morin: “When we developed our 2015 simple method, we found it was a great achievement to measure sprint acceleration mechanics with a very high concurrent validity compared to the gold standard force plate measurements. My Sprint takes things to another level, since it allows accurate measurements with just an iPhone!”\n\nMy Sprint calculates Power-Force-Velocity profile and measures the individual sprint mechanical outputs (force, velocity, power, effectiveness) of athletes using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. It was specially designed to take advantage of the extraordinary 120-240fps camera of the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. You just need to perform an all-out 40 m sprint and mark the track with a reference system marks located at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 meters and you only need six visible vertical markers (like thin poles) at these markers to record the time between markers. After that My Sprint does the computations and calculates athlete´s mechanical capabilities.  \n\nFEATURES: \n\n- Accurate measurement of the split times over a sprint acceleration. Scientifically validated!\n- Calculation the Power-Force-Velocity profile using the innovative Samozino et al.´s method. You can therefore know the athlete’s mechanical capabilities that determine the entire sprint acceleration performance. These properties are integrative and encompass all the mechanisms involved in the total external force produced during each lower limb extension and the ability to orient it effectively onto the ground. \n- Record amazing slow motion videos up to 240fps (iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s) and analyse in a frame-by-frame mode as well as import videos from your camera roll. \n- Multi-user. You can create as many users as your need with My Sprint. You can assign each user to a team for a higher ease of use. \n- Performance follow-up. You can record as many sprints as you want for each user created and analyze performance through a competitive season. \n\nNote: My Sprint was scientifically validated using an iPhone 6, and it uses the slow motion video recording on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. On other devices, the measurements are less accurate slow motion video recording feature is not available. \n\nA SPRINT ACCELERATION MECHANICS LAB IN YOUR POCKET!"

Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS, WiFi and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle position and spark plug type values are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration given in the next tabs. Under the recommended main jet, the calculated real value with decimals is shown. Besides this jetting information, the air density, density altitude and relative horsepower are shown too. In addition, this tab lets do a fine tunning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine. We strongly advise you to adjust this value before the race in order to get an optimum performance. This value will be stored and used in the future sessions.\n\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, pressure, altitude and humidity. The values of this screen can be manually set or can be loaded by the application reading the data from the nearest weather station (from the GPS tab).\n\n- Engine: you can set in this screen the information about the engine and the track, that is, the engine type (Senior, Junior, Minimax, Micromax, Supermax or DD2), the spark plug brand used, the needle type, the float/pilot jet combo, the float height, airbox type (new model or the old square model), track type (with long, short or medium straights), oil mix ratio and venturi type (12.5 or 8.5).\n\n- GPS: This tab allows to use the location service (using GPS or WiFi) to get the current position and altitude, and connect to an external service to get the weather conditions of the nearest weather station (temperature, pressure and humidity).\n\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, meter and feet for altitude, and mb, hPa, mmHg, inHg y atm for pressures."

Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion/human-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*See webpage: sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!  I have used it for timing during our track and field, speed quickness & agility, fitness testing, & many more units.  It is very accurate and easy to use and gets the job done quickly!  A must-have!\"\nmertonphysed.weebly.com\n\n \"The app is very professionally set up and you can very easily capture your whole Track event.\"\nwww.melhamada.com\n\n\"Very useful app for measuring and/or verifying close finishes to track and field or road races.\"\nphysedreview.weebly.com\n\nSatisfied users from all over the world:\n- Brilliant.  A fantastic app for use in school athletics lessons\n- Amazing. This application is awesome and the results are really accurate.\n- What a brilliant app! Our £9k photo finish camera broke down and this app was a real lifesaver and worth way more than £1.50! Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year. There is a 2 weeks free trial period.\n\nShould you choose to subscribe to SprintTimer Pro, the purchase will be charged to your Apple ID account. The subscription will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the period. You can manage it from the user settings in iTunes after purchasing it, and you will also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there.\n\nIf you purchase a new SprintTimer Pro subscription during a free trial you will forfeit any free trial remaining from your first subscription.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy: https://sprinttimer.se/privacy\n\n\nIcon runners made by Freepik from Flaticon.com"

      "label": "Measuring your car's torque and horsepower has never been easier, now that you can do it with the help of your mobile device and this digital Dyno. You just need to open your datalog of a pull, and Log Dyno will do the rest. \n\nYou can send your CSV file from your email, browser, or any app to Log Dyno which will Open the datalog from the app right away and give you a measurement, or you can save your CSV file to the Log Dyno folder in your Files app, for easy access from the in-app file browser.\n\nYou can use any CSV or MSL file that contains RPM data which is needed to accurately measure Horsepower and Torque.\n\nFrom the torque curve and gear ratios, the app will also recommend optimal gear shift points for each gear to ensure maximum acceleration. This makes sure you know when to shift, so you always have the most possible power at the wheels.\n\nCorrections:\n●\tUncorrected\n●\tSAE J1349\n●\tSTD\n●\tDIN 70020\n●\tISO 1585\n\nPower Units:\n●\tWHP\n●\tBHP\n●\tPS\n●\tKW\n\nTorque Units:\n●\tLB-FT\n●\tNM\nEither at the wheels or at the crank\n\nCompare multiple measurements!\n\nYou can save each one of your Dyno measurements, and compare them, or just analyze them interactively.\n\nWhat datalog files can be used?\n\n●\tJB4\n●\tMHD\n●\tProTool\n●\tCOBB\n●\tMegaSquirt\n●\tProTool\n●      Bootmod3\n●\tand any other CSV file\n\nThis is the easiest way to have your torque and horsepower measured with a virtual dyno using only your mobile phone and your datalog. You can see if your mods or tune work right away, and compare them.\n\nLog Dyno has been compared to multiple real life dyno sheets, and measurements were spot on, with multiple different vehicles\n\nHow does it work?\n\n#1. Datalog your vehicle\nTake the log just like a dyno pull, in one given gear, from low rpm to high rpm. Try to avoid wheelspin as it can cause spikes in the graph.\n\n#2. Set up your vehicle data\n\nThe dyno app requires some data about your vehicle. You’ll be asked to set values for the following:\n\n●\tCar Name\n●\tWeight\n●\tTank Capacity\n●\tTire Size\n●\tDT%\n●\tDrag Coefficient\n●\tFrontal Area\n\n#3. Share the results!\n\nYou can share your results right from the virtual dyno measurement page to basically any app or post it to any social network or email it. Of course, you can just save the results in your phone gallery too.\n\nHow accurate is the dyno measurement?\n\nIf you have set your vehicle data correctly, the results our dyno app gives will be the same as the results a real dyno will give you. Also, keep in mind that wheelspin may result in spikes in the graph. If you are unable to avoid it, you’ll still get accurate results, you just need to ignore the spikes.\n\nThe best thing about our dyno app is that you can see right away how your mods work after datalogging.\nNow, you don't have to go to the dyno if you want to measure any small modification or just never had your car's power measured. You can see right away how your mods or tune work after datalogging. You can dyno unlimited times and unlimited vehicles for the fraction of the price of a dyno measurement.\n\nYou have to set your car up, how much it weighs, its tire size, the gear ratios, and also what your car drag coefficient and frontal area are, which the app will help in determining.\n\nAfter specifying for which gear you had the datalog taken and specifying the driver, passenger, and possible cargo weight, you can open the CSV or MSL file.\n\nBased on your car data and environmental values, the app generates a torque and horsepower curve, which you can analyze. The app also points out the peak values, and you will be able to see at what rpm you made the most torque and the most power.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to send an email: profisoftgames@gmail.com"

It typically provides real time information of a variometer like altimeter, speedometer, odometer, chronometer, gyrometer, anemometer for every (air)craft pilot. Its configurable cockpit allows you to keep track of the most relevant to you. The integrated data logger automatically records your 3D location and provides the recorded track file to e.g. your iCloud Drive for track visualisation or flight metrics.\n\nTurn on & Fly!\nNo need for additional/external hardware.\n\neVario is mainly designed for paragliding/hang-gliding, but may be used as well while biking, hiking, running, sailing, skiing, flying, …\n\nOptimised for low battery usage, the app lets you:\n▶ PLAN AHEAD: Check detailed weather conditions (emagram) over days for your safety, in Europe. Check surroundings and thermal hotspots on the topographic outdoor map. \n▶ PLAN LANDING: Set a marker e.g. at the landing area and get assistance when approaching.\n▶ TOUCH&GO: Turn on & Go fly! The cockpit shows real-time data after a short automatic instrument calibration.\n▶ TAKE OFF: Automatic track recording is taking place in background and take-off altitude is referenced.\n▶ STAY IN CONTROL: Control the behaviour, update rate, unit of the instruments, anytime and anywhere. Select a pre-defined setting profile matching thermal conditions.\n▶ THERMALLING: Get acoustical and visual feedback of the encountered thermals and easily locate them when returning back.\n▶ BE EFFICIENT: Track wind estimation, direction and force, to soar or prepare your landing.\n▶ FIND LANDING: At e.g. a new site, locate the marked landing zone.\n▶ REVIEW TRACK: Visualise the past track on 4 map styles or show the track elevation profile graph in animated or interactive mode.\n▶ MANAGE LOGBOOK: Access each individual track record time stamped file, synchronise them with your iCloud. Personalise eVario to contain glider/user information. \n▶ DO MORE: Re-Play your 3D flight e.g. in GoogleEarth, Analyse flight metrics in BaseCamp.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n*Cockpit\n▶ Clear dashboard of digital real time data\n▶ Advanced interactive cockpit with configurable measurement field display\n▶ Access a large number of settings directly impacting sensoric, display, acoustic or interaction\n▶ Unlimited GPS tracks and waypoints saves\n▶ Support of metric and imperial unit system\n▶ Support of GPX/IGC record formats\n▶ Automatic tracking start/stop upon movement detection\n▶ Automatic GPS track recording\n▶ Logbook with individual 3D GPS track records (timestamp, latitude, longitude, elevation) supporting derived data analysis\n▶ Manage/Share track files from within integrated file browser\n\n*Map\n▶ Visualise your position, track line, thermal hotspots, sites, weather data on map\n▶ Map enhancement by overlaid instruments like altitude, speed or ascent\n▶ Map style selection: choose from 4 styles including terrain (dark/bright), topo and satellite\n▶ Offline map downloads worldwide!

The first are Co2 tables that enhance your tolerance regarding Co2 levels in your blood. The second are O2 tables which help extending your maximum breath hold time.\n\nWARNING:\nNever train alone! You should always have someone next to you that knows that you are training and understands the risk involved.\nNever train more than one session per day! Also do not train more than two times a week. Stop the training immediately when you feel uncomfortable.\nDo not under any circumstances provide a wrong maximum breath hold time. This is used to calculate the suggested session times.\nConsult with your doctor before starting to train. The training can lead to blackouts, loss of motor control (LMC), serious and irreparable damages to the respiratory system, serious and irreparable damages to the brain, other serious health damage or death.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nThe showed times are only suggestions that do not guarantee any training success. Any training session suggested by the app has to be carefully reviewed by a professional prior to training."

      "label": "Mobile App \"RallyPacenotes\" (www.rallypacenotesapp.com) is designed to be the best aid for rally drivers (section \"Driver\") and rally codrivers (\"Co-driver\" section).\n\nThe application was created by Miguel E. Susunaga Valencia (migSVapps.com), from the original idea of Raúl Belategui and with the sports advice of David Nafría. Its effectiveness and usefulness have been contrasted in the pacenotes courses TheRallyDriver.com for drivers.\n\n\n\"Driver\" section:\n\nThe \"Driver\" section is designed to help rally drivers in the difficult task of doing special stages pacenotes. The app allows teams to write down the intensity of each corner using the steering wheel angle rotation. The numbering of each corner, \"8\", \"3+\", \"120\" or any other information that each pilot uses in its pacenotes system, is fully configurable, as well as the strip of degrees in which it must show the Information.\n\nThe application is designed to be used in the first “recce” run, which is performed at low speed, for this reason and because a high speed can affect the sensor measurement, the corner numbering is shown only when the speed is less than 80 km/h.\n\nIn addition to intensity, the application also helps us calculate the distances between corners using GPS signal. The driver has up to 3 different trips. One “partial”, another “total” and even a third specially designed to measure the corner’s lengths.\n\nIt also shows us the current speed of the vehicle. Something that is especially useful in those recces in which the speed is limited and controlled by the organization. The driver can set at what speed he wants to receive an alert so as not to exceed that limit. Two different speeds can be set with their respective alerts.\n\n\n\"Codriver\" section:\n\nThe \"Codriver\" section is divided into 3 screens. The first offers codrivers the tools necessary to facilitate the management of times and distances between time controls. It allows to calculate the time of entry in the following time control, it shows the real time, the time remaining until the next time control and 3 trips (regressive, partial and Total) that calculate the distances by means of GPS. It also shows the current speed of the vehicle (obtained by GPS), which will be of great help especially those cars that do not have a speedometer to not exceed the speed limits in the road sections.\n\nThe second screen helps us in the special stages. It has a chronometer with different starting possibilities. Allows to save and compare splits between the different runs by the same special stage. And it also has a total trip and a regressive one.\n\nA third screen helps us to calculate a forecast of the fuel consumption until the next refuelling, distinguishing between kilometers and consumptions of road section and special stages."

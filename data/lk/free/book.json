We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com\n\nAs the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter. \n\n\nمن صناع Quran.com يأتي تطبيق القرآن للأجهزة المحمولة، تطبيق للمصحف ذو صفحات جميلة خالي تماما من الاعلانات.\n\nلقد أصبح من السهل قراءة القرآن بالشارع، وحفظه، والاستماع إلى قارئك المفضل.\n\nهذا هو مجرد بداية لتطبيق القرآن. سنعمل على تحديث التطبيق بشكل منتظم إن شاء الله، ونحب أن نسمع رأيك ومتطلبتك. يمكنك الوصول إلينا عن طريق البريد الإلكتروني ios@quran.com\n\nعَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة."

The Kundali can be drawn either in North Indian or South Indian chart format. \n\nDainika Panchangam - Apart from listing five basic elements of Panchangam, detailed Dainika Panchang highlights Panchaka, Ganda Moola, Bhadra, Vinchudo and all auspicious Yoga including Ravi, Amrita, Sarvartha Siddhi, Tripushkara, Dwipushkara, Ravi Pushya and Guru Pushya for each day.\nDainika Panchangam also lists Abhijit Muhurta, Amrit Kalam, Rahu Kalam, Gulikai Kalam, Yamaganda, Dur Muhurtam, Varjyam and Anandadi Yoga.\n\nMuhurta Table - Drik Panchang comes with day and night Choghadiya, Shubh Horai and Udaya Lagna.

Josekutty Thomas SDB presents on the centenary of the arrival of the first Salesian missionaries to northeast India (1922-2022) The Bible in Tongues, a Mobile Application with the text and audio of the Bible in languages.\n\nWith this application you can leisurely choose the books of the Bible, locate the chapters, and read it in the language of your choice. But if you cannot read or you just want to listen to it, CLICK THE PLAY BUTTON and you can listen to the audio version\n\nYou can also read the Holy Bible in which ever language you want. It is also possible to compare the texts in different languages available. If you cannot understand a word or phrase in one language, you can switch to another language you are familiar with. The App will automatically lead you to the same book and chapter you are reading.\n\nWe thank Fr Angel Fernandez Artime, Rector Major of the Salesians of Don Bosco, for releasing it. We are grateful to the bishops, priests, and lay people their support and encouragement. In particular, we want to thank Fr Jose Umbavu Thattil, Fr Francis Thottathimyalil, Fr Devasy Palatty, Fr Joseph Pulinthanath, Fr Paul Panii, Fr Jose Varickasseril, Fr Joy Kachappilly, Fr Emmanuel Phuvito, Fr Mathai Kottarathil and Mr Wanglit Mongchan many others who have worked tirelessly for the translation of the text.

Hadith are made available on this application as a resource for research, personal study, and understanding. The text of one or a few hadith alone are not taken as rulings by themselves; scholars have a sophisticated process using the principles of fiqh to come up with rulings. We do not advocate do-it-yourself fiqh using these hadith for those who are untrained in these principles. If you have a question on a specific ruling, please ask your local scholar."

It is considered an apocryphal book as well as a part of the Pseudepigrapha (literally means “falsely ascribed” is a collection of works supposedly written by a biblical character), although it is not a part of the canonical Apocrypha.\n\nOnce considered to be of Christian origin because of its obvious references to Christ, ten fragments of The Book of Enoch have been found at Qumran in the Dead Sea Scrolls, it is known to have existed in its present form since at least the 2nd Century BC.\n\nThe book was believed to have been composed by Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. Most critics and scholars believe it was begun in the second century BC and was a collection of works that includes writings for the first century BC as well. Some believe it contains the actual words of Enoch and that it was handed down through the ages. There is no real way to know for certain if that is so. The only thing we know for certain is that fragments of the book date back to the 2nd century BC.\n\nIt is generally believed that the Apostles and the writers of the New Testament were fully aware of the Book of Enoch also called 1 Enoch. In fact, it is directly quoted in the Bible:\n\nJude 1:14-15 “And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, {15} To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him”"

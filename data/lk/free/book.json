Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com\n\nAs the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter. \n\n\nمن صناع Quran.com يأتي تطبيق القرآن للأجهزة المحمولة، تطبيق للمصحف ذو صفحات جميلة خالي تماما من الاعلانات.\n\nلقد أصبح من السهل قراءة القرآن بالشارع، وحفظه، والاستماع إلى قارئك المفضل.\n\nهذا هو مجرد بداية لتطبيق القرآن. سنعمل على تحديث التطبيق بشكل منتظم إن شاء الله، ونحب أن نسمع رأيك ومتطلبتك. يمكنك الوصول إلينا عن طريق البريد الإلكتروني ios@quran.com\n\nعَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة."

      "label": "This app brings you most of the lyrics used by Tamil churches all over the world. Now, you can sing songs of praise and thanksgiving to God with all the lyrics you need in an elegantly designed app that doesn't display any ads.\n\nWhy develop another app when there are tons of similar apps?\nWorship Songs was initially developed as we couldn't find an app with both Tamil and Transliterated (Romanised) text. \nNow, our vision has grown to bring all the good quality songs Tamil Christians use to praise and thank God in one easy to use app that doesn't display any advertisements.\n\nMany Tamil congregations also sing English songs. Worship Songs provides many popular English songs as well, so you need not look for another app. \n\nAnd finally, the song database grows rapidly. New songs are added often, so you will never miss your favourite song. We would like to add a word that we are extremely careful in our song selection. We do not want to add all the songs out there in the wild but only good quality ones that's scriptural.\n\nDid we mention that Worship Songs is open source? Yes, you can be a part of this project. Isn't that great?\n\nFEATURES\n\n- A large collection of Tamil and English songs, Jebathotta Jeyageethangal, Keerthanaigal, Seyalveerar Geethangal (FMPB), Sarah Navaroji songs etc.\n- Transliterated (Romanised) text for Tamil songs\n- Songs grouped by Titles, Authors, Categories, Song Books\n- Ability to quickly search for a song by its title or content or song number in a Song Book\n- Manage your favourite list of songs through \"Favourites\". This will help you to organize songs that will be used in next Sunday service, Small Group meetings or simply to manage your favourite list.\n- \"Present song\" on your TV or projector wireless (Miracast/WiDi) or via HDMI cable connection (MHL, SlimPort or Micro-HDMI port).\n- YouTube video support for selected songs.\n- Share your favourite song or a verse from a song to Whatsapp, Facebook etc\n- Ability to use your own song database (in OpenLP db format) hosted in GitHub, Dropbox shared folder etc..\n- Professional design with no ads.\n\nFAQ\n\nQ. I couldn't find a song that I am looking for. What should I do?\n\nRefine your search terms. For example, instead of \"Arathanai\", try searching for \"Aarathanai\". Worship Songs names the song titles that matches closely with their Tamil counterparts.\n\nQ. I still couldn't find the song. I bet it's not there in your database. What now?\n\nYou can create a new issue at our Github project https://github.com/mcruncher/worshipsongs-db-dev. Worship Songs is an open source project. Anyone interested can contribute song lyrics. If you are interested, please let us know.\n\nQ. I want to request a new feature. How do I go about that?\n\nThe songs database and the app are maintained in separate Github projects. Worship Songs for iOS lives at https://github.com/mcruncher/worshipsongs-ios. You can request for a new feature by creating an issue there. Or you can use the Feedback feature within the app to communicate with us.\n\nQ. How do I report bugs?\n\nPlease create an issue and apply the label \"Bug\" in our Github project. Kindly refer the previous question for project details. Please do not report bugs through comments.\n\nQ. How can I help you guys?\n\nIf you find Worship Songs to be useful, please give it a good rating and share your opinion. Please help others know about this app by spreading word. You can contribute song lyrics or if you are good at iOS development, you can contribute code.\n\nQ. Is there a way I can use these songs in my Church?\n\nAbsolutely. In fact, the songs database that is shipped with this app is used by Tamil Methodist Church Subang Jaya. \nIf you want to do that in your Church, you would need to install a software named OpenLP and replace it's default songs database with the one that ships with this app.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\n- Copyrighted songs are owned by respective Copyright holders.\n- Linked YouTube videos are owned by respective Copyright holders."

Although this should be rare, it is possible that the server may be under maintenance and offline for a time. Always try again. Thank you. \n\nAdvantages:\n- Completely free and without advertising.\n- Very fast and easy to navigate.\n- Audio for all chapters can be downloaded and listened to \"offline\"\n- Biblical texts included.\n- Section of selected verses by topic - which includes its audio.\n- Available with continuous play - that is, chapters play continuously as in a playlist - transforming your device into a neat audio player.\n\nNow you may read and listen to the Bible in your mobile device through this comprehensive application put together by H. Kahng and the WordProject team.\n\nThe application offers the Holy Bible (Text and Audio) in no less than 36 of the most wide-spoken languages of the world: Chinese, Hindi, English, Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Indonesian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Italian, German, Swahili, Turkish, Vietnamese, Amharic, Thai, Persian, Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Serbian, Czech, Polish, Romanian, Somali. This application offers audio narrations, not dramatized versions. Portuguese narration in European Portuguese.\n\nThe application comes with the default in English and all other languages are easily and automatically installed with one click, according to the needs of the user. The text in any language takes 30 seconds or less to download and gets automatically installed, you just need to have your device connected through Wi-Fi or DATA. Audio chapters can be streamed, and heard in any language when you are connected to Wi-Fi or DATA, or may be download into your device for use offline anytime, anywhere.\n\nThe audio download is available book by book, which means that even if you have limited space, you can download a book (i.e. Genesis), use it for awhile, and then uninstall it and download a new one - this can be done in any of the 36 languages available with both text and audio. If you have plenty of space in your device, then you may download the whole Audio Bible - if you wish to.\n\nTo use the audio continuous play option more effectively, please note that you should set the app to continuous play. Usually in iOS devices, the screen needs to be always on for the audio continuous play to be in effect. In that case, we also recommend that you use the brightness level  to adjust the brightness to a minimum. That way you can enjoy listen to the Bible for several hours and keep your battery. Of course if you plug your device to the power outlet you can listen to the Bible all day…\n\nThe purpose of this application is to make the Word available to as many people as possible, so new languages might be available in future versions.\n\nFor more audio and text Bibles, please visit the original Wordproject site: http://www.wordproject.org"

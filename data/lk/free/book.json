See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad bin Talal in 1433 AH / 2012 CE.\n \nHaving noticed that the Divine Names, key Qur’anic verses and sacred formulas were not available free online in the most perfect and beautiful styles of Arabic calligraphy, the Prince Ghazi Trust for Qur’anic Thought commissioned prize-winning calligrapher Mothana Al-Obaydi and other calligraphers to draw them and digitize them onto ‘Word documents’ so that they can be adapted, colored and printed out by anyone according to their taste from the app and website. \nThus, instead of paying for decorating their home with drawings or Western posters, or instead of paying for expensive name-brand calligraphy, any Muslim in the world can adapt the most beautiful pieces of calligraphy and decorate his or her home with it for the price of a piece of a paper. This, God willing, will not only make people’s homes more beautiful, but also their lives more beautiful as they see and remember God’s Name more often."

The text of one or a few hadith alone are not taken as rulings by themselves; scholars have a sophisticated process using the principles of fiqh to come up with rulings.

      "label": "This app brings you most of the lyrics used by Tamil churches all over the world. Now, you can sing songs of praise and thanksgiving to God with all the lyrics you need in an elegantly designed app that doesn't display any ads.\n\nWhy develop another app when there are tons of similar apps?\nWorship Songs was initially developed as we couldn't find an app with both Tamil and Transliterated (Romanised) text. \nNow, our vision has grown to bring all the good quality songs Tamil Christians use to praise and thank God in one easy to use app that doesn't display any advertisements.\n\nMany Tamil congregations also sing English songs. Worship Songs provides many popular English songs as well, so you need not look for another app. \n\nAnd finally, the song database grows rapidly. New songs are added often, so you will never miss your favourite song. We would like to add a word that we are extremely careful in our song selection. We do not want to add all the songs out there in the wild but only good quality ones that's scriptural.\n\nDid we mention that Worship Songs is open source? Yes, you can be a part of this project. Isn't that great?\n\nFEATURES\n\n- A large collection of Tamil and English songs, Jebathotta Jeyageethangal, Keerthanaigal, Seyalveerar Geethangal (FMPB), Sarah Navaroji songs etc.\n- Transliterated (Romanised) text for Tamil songs\n- Songs grouped by Titles, Authors, Categories, Song Books\n- Ability to quickly search for a song by its title or content or song number in a Song Book\n- Manage your favourite list of songs through \"Favourites\". This will help you to organize songs that will be used in next Sunday service, Small Group meetings or simply to manage your favourite list.\n- \"Present song\" on your TV or projector wireless (Miracast/WiDi) or via HDMI cable connection (MHL, SlimPort or Micro-HDMI port).\n- YouTube video support for selected songs.\n- Share your favourite song or a verse from a song to Whatsapp, Facebook etc\n- Ability to use your own song database (in OpenLP db format) hosted in GitHub, Dropbox shared folder etc..\n- Professional design with no ads.\n\nFAQ\n\nQ. I couldn't find a song that I am looking for. What should I do?\n\nRefine your search terms. For example, instead of \"Arathanai\", try searching for \"Aarathanai\". Worship Songs names the song titles that matches closely with their Tamil counterparts.\n\nQ. I still couldn't find the song. I bet it's not there in your database. What now?\n\nYou can create a new issue at our Github project https://github.com/mcruncher/worshipsongs-db-dev. Worship Songs is an open source project. Anyone interested can contribute song lyrics. If you are interested, please let us know.\n\nQ. I want to request a new feature. How do I go about that?\n\nThe songs database and the app are maintained in separate Github projects. Worship Songs for iOS lives at https://github.com/mcruncher/worshipsongs-ios. You can request for a new feature by creating an issue there. Or you can use the Feedback feature within the app to communicate with us.\n\nQ. How do I report bugs?\n\nPlease create an issue and apply the label \"Bug\" in our Github project. Kindly refer the previous question for project details. Please do not report bugs through comments.\n\nQ. How can I help you guys?\n\nIf you find Worship Songs to be useful, please give it a good rating and share your opinion. Please help others know about this app by spreading word. You can contribute song lyrics or if you are good at iOS development, you can contribute code.\n\nQ. Is there a way I can use these songs in my Church?\n\nAbsolutely. In fact, the songs database that is shipped with this app is used by Tamil Methodist Church Subang Jaya. \nIf you want to do that in your Church, you would need to install a software named OpenLP and replace it's default songs database with the one that ships with this app.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\n- Copyrighted songs are owned by respective Copyright holders.\n- Linked YouTube videos are owned by respective Copyright holders."

      "label": "Reimagining the Examen offers a unique prayer experience that’s tailored to your needs and mood. Each Examen, based on St. Ignatius’s 500-year-old prayer, guides you through a stimulating reflection on your day, helping you invite God into your nitty-gritty. Choose an Examen that matches your current state of being, or pray that day’s scheduled reflection.\n \nReimagining the Examen, created by Loyola Press, is based on Mark Thibodeaux, SJ’s best-selling book, “Reimagining the Ignatian Examen,” which offers flexible and adaptable versions of the Examen. Begin the app experience today to invite grace, gratitude, and insight into your daily life.\n\nWhat is the Examen? \nSt. Ignatius of Loyola created the Examen to be a very short prayer that can be prayed at any time. In the Examen, we review our recent past to find God and his blessings in our daily life. Ignatius would say that the Examen should be the most important moment of our day, because this moment affects every other moment.\n\nHow Do I Pray the Examen?\nThere are five simple steps to the Examen, which this app leads you through:\n\n1. Relish the moments that went well and all of the gifts you have today.\n2. Request that the Spirit lead you through your review of the day.\n3. Review your day.\n4. Repent of any mistakes or failures.\n5. Resolve, in concrete ways, to live tomorrow well."

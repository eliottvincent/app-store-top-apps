We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com\n\nAs the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter. \n\n\nمن صناع Quran.com يأتي تطبيق القرآن للأجهزة المحمولة، تطبيق للمصحف ذو صفحات جميلة خالي تماما من الاعلانات.\n\nلقد أصبح من السهل قراءة القرآن بالشارع، وحفظه، والاستماع إلى قارئك المفضل.\n\nهذا هو مجرد بداية لتطبيق القرآن. سنعمل على تحديث التطبيق بشكل منتظم إن شاء الله، ونحب أن نسمع رأيك ومتطلبتك. يمكنك الوصول إلينا عن طريق البريد الإلكتروني ios@quran.com\n\nعَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة."

      "label": "The “Little Stories” series is a collection of fairy tales in which your kid plays the main role. It's quite simple – just enter your kid's name and gender into the settings window and enjoy reading fairy tales about your son or daughter.\n\nTo make it even cooler, we've added beautiful melodies and wonderful pictures to help you raise your child by giving him or her only positive examples. Moreover, you can also make your own audiobooks! Just spend a few minutes to voice-over the story.\n\nLet love and kindness fill your family’s leisure time to make your life and the world around you happier!\n\nWhy “Little Stories”?\n• 1800+ pictures\n• Gender determines the choice of illustrations\n• 45 exciting fairy tales so far and more to come\n• Enchanting music accompanies each story\n• You can create audiobooks by recording your own voice!\n• 1st place in the “Entertainment” category of Rating Runet in 2018!\n• 1st place in the “App For Kids” category of Golden App in 2016!\n• 3rd place in the “Entertainment” category of Golden App in 2017!\n\nWe’d like to tell you more about the process behind creating stories for kids so that you have a better idea about the hard work we put into “Little Stories”.\n\n1) It all begins with searching for an author. He/she can live in any country of the world, but the important thing is that he/she is able to create an interesting and insightful story. Before writing a bedtime story, the author has to read the conditions first. For example, the story may not contain more than 50 scenes (each of which can consist of 146 symbols max.) otherwise the text won’t fit into the app. Once the story has been completed, the next stage can begin.\n\n2) It is now  time to create the storyboard. A storyboard is a selection of simple sketches for each of the illustrations of the story. It gives us a better idea about the visual images of the children’s story.\n\n3) Once the storyboard has been approved, we move on to searching for an illustrator. It should be noted that not all styles might be appropriate for a certain bedtime story and, therefore, it’s important to achieve a perfect fit between the story and the illustration style.\n\n4) Meanwhile, the composer creates the melody. Both the story itself and the artist’s illustrations serve as inspiration for the creation of music. The composer also has conditions to meet: the melody must be soothing and prepare children for a good night’s sleep since most often stories are read for bedtime.\n\n5) What’s more, we also translate our stories for kids into other languages.\n\n6) But that’s not the end! It’s important to see how the book for kids looks inside the app. Line breaks should be checked to make sure the text looks nice and neat. This is done by two professionals: the programmer and the tester.\n\n7) Only after this final step do we release the story for kids. This entire process might take anywhere from two to nine months. So, it’s a hard, but interesting, journey!\n\nWe continuously add new fairy tales to our collection! \nFairy tales are designed for kids aged 3+.\n\nFollow us on: facebook.com/diveomedia"

Hadith are made available on this application as a resource for research, personal study, and understanding. The text of one or a few hadith alone are not taken as rulings by themselves; scholars have a sophisticated process using the principles of fiqh to come up with rulings. We do not advocate do-it-yourself fiqh using these hadith for those who are untrained in these principles. If you have a question on a specific ruling, please ask your local scholar."

      "label": "This app brings you most of the lyrics used by Tamil churches all over the world. Now, you can sing songs of praise and thanksgiving to God with all the lyrics you need in an elegantly designed app that doesn't display any ads.\n\nWhy develop another app when there are tons of similar apps?\nWorship Songs was initially developed as we couldn't find an app with both Tamil and Transliterated (Romanised) text. \nNow, our vision has grown to bring all the good quality songs Tamil Christians use to praise and thank God in one easy to use app that doesn't display any advertisements.\n\nMany Tamil congregations also sing English songs. Worship Songs provides many popular English songs as well, so you need not look for another app. \n\nAnd finally, the song database grows rapidly. New songs are added often, so you will never miss your favourite song. We would like to add a word that we are extremely careful in our song selection. We do not want to add all the songs out there in the wild but only good quality ones that's scriptural.\n\nDid we mention that Worship Songs is open source? Yes, you can be a part of this project. Isn't that great?\n\nFEATURES\n\n- A large collection of Tamil and English songs, Jebathotta Jeyageethangal, Keerthanaigal, Seyalveerar Geethangal (FMPB), Sarah Navaroji songs etc.\n- Transliterated (Romanised) text for Tamil songs\n- Songs grouped by Titles, Authors, Categories, Song Books\n- Ability to quickly search for a song by its title or content or song number in a Song Book\n- Manage your favourite list of songs through \"Favourites\". This will help you to organize songs that will be used in next Sunday service, Small Group meetings or simply to manage your favourite list.\n- \"Present song\" on your TV or projector wireless (Miracast/WiDi) or via HDMI cable connection (MHL, SlimPort or Micro-HDMI port).\n- YouTube video support for selected songs.\n- Share your favourite song or a verse from a song to Whatsapp, Facebook etc\n- Ability to use your own song database (in OpenLP db format) hosted in GitHub, Dropbox shared folder etc..\n- Professional design with no ads.\n\nFAQ\n\nQ. I couldn't find a song that I am looking for. What should I do?\n\nRefine your search terms. For example, instead of \"Arathanai\", try searching for \"Aarathanai\". Worship Songs names the song titles that matches closely with their Tamil counterparts.\n\nQ. I still couldn't find the song. I bet it's not there in your database. What now?\n\nYou can create a new issue at our Github project https://github.com/mcruncher/worshipsongs-db-dev. Worship Songs is an open source project. Anyone interested can contribute song lyrics. If you are interested, please let us know.\n\nQ. I want to request a new feature. How do I go about that?\n\nThe songs database and the app are maintained in separate Github projects. Worship Songs for iOS lives at https://github.com/mcruncher/worshipsongs-ios. You can request for a new feature by creating an issue there. Or you can use the Feedback feature within the app to communicate with us.\n\nQ. How do I report bugs?\n\nPlease create an issue and apply the label \"Bug\" in our Github project. Kindly refer the previous question for project details. Please do not report bugs through comments.\n\nQ. How can I help you guys?\n\nIf you find Worship Songs to be useful, please give it a good rating and share your opinion. Please help others know about this app by spreading word. You can contribute song lyrics or if you are good at iOS development, you can contribute code.\n\nQ. Is there a way I can use these songs in my Church?\n\nAbsolutely. In fact, the songs database that is shipped with this app is used by Tamil Methodist Church Subang Jaya. \nIf you want to do that in your Church, you would need to install a software named OpenLP and replace it's default songs database with the one that ships with this app.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\n- Copyrighted songs are owned by respective Copyright holders.\n- Linked YouTube videos are owned by respective Copyright holders."

The story of the writing of the book is as follows:\n\n “Every night, Hazrat Sulayman Jazuli’s wife travels to and back from Madina al-Munawwara. The great wali asks her how she does this, and what she has done to gain such a degree. She replies: “I know a salawat-i sharifa, and I go and come back thanks to this.” But she does not tell the salawat, because it is a secret (sirr). Afterwards Sulayman Jazuli (q.s) gathers all salawat-i sharifas in his book and asks his wife if there is the one she recites in the book. After reading, she smiles and says that it is mentioned in a few places of the book.”\n\nThis application is based upon the Dalail el Hayrat book from Semerkand Publications."

A mirror has the ability to reflect good and positive energy.\n\nMirrors can also be used in a small room. If you want to make it appear bigger, you can use a mirror so that it will reflect the space, making it look like it is bigger than it actually is. Mirrors are also representative of endless possibilities for you. \n\"Good Luck\""

      "label": "Bible en français Louis Segond (Traduction King James Version - KJV) Ancien Testament et du Nouveau Testament.\nAussi je vous recommande \"Concordance Biblique\" - vous trouver dans mes applications.\nAprès la mort de Segond, la Société biblique britannique et étrangère révise la traduction, en 1910, en choisissant d'autres termes doctrinaux plus conformes à la pensée protestante orthodoxe (par exemple : « sacrificateurs » à la place de « prêtres », « foi » à la place de « fidélité »)6. Cette version 1910 deviendra la traduction protestante la plus lue au cours du xxe siècle.\nJusqu'au 19ème siècle, le protestantisme francophone a pour l'essentiel utilisé la traduction de la Bible réalisée par Olivétan, un cousin de Jean Calvin.\nLa Compagnie des pasteurs de Genève demande au docteur en théologie Louis Segond de réaliser une nouvelle traduction. Celui-ci traduit les textes à partir de l'hébreu, de l'araméen et du grec, langues \"originelles\", et non plus d'après la Vulgate latine, comme cela se faisait jusqu'alors. L'Ancien Testament ne comprend pas les textes appelés deutérocanoniques par la tradition catholique.\nLa version Segond paraît en 1880. Elle connaîtra une très grande diffusion et sera adoptée par l'ensemble du protestantisme francophone. En 1910 parait le texte de la 3ème édition, remanié et révisé. Il laisse mieux apparaître la divinité de Jésus Christ, selon les textes originaux."

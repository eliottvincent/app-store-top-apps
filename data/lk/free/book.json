Kindle books you have purchased on Amazon will automatically appear in your app. Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime members can select and download Kindle books directly in the app.\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT GREAT READ\n• Read the books you buy on Amazon in the Kindle app. Choose from over six million Kindle books (including those with Audible narration), magazines, and comics and start reading in seconds. Explore Amazon Charts best sellers and titles across genres like romance, science fiction, children’s books, self-help, religion, nonfiction, and more—and try any book with a free sample straight from the Kindle app.\n\n• Kindle Unlimited members can enjoy unlimited reading and listening, with the freedom to explore over 1 million titles, thousands of audiobooks, and current magazines. \n\n• Over 1,000 books, magazines, comics, and more included with Amazon Prime.\n\n• Kindle Vella brings you stories released one short episode at a time.

Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip.

When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

      "label": "NOTICE: This APP offers streaming of audio directly from our servers. If you ever experience interruption in the audio streaming or download, please try again later or another day. Although this should be rare, it is possible that the server may be under maintenance and offline for a time. Always try again. Thank you. \n\nAdvantages:\n- Completely free and without advertising.\n- Very fast and easy to navigate.\n- Audio for all chapters can be downloaded and listened to \"offline\"\n- Biblical texts included.\n- Section of selected verses by topic - which includes its audio.\n- Available with continuous play - that is, chapters play continuously as in a playlist - transforming your device into a neat audio player.\n\nNow you may read and listen to the Bible in your mobile device through this comprehensive application put together by H. Kahng and the WordProject team.\n\nThe application offers the Holy Bible (Text and Audio) in no less than 36 of the most wide-spoken languages of the world: Chinese, Hindi, English, Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Indonesian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Italian, German, Swahili, Turkish, Vietnamese, Amharic, Thai, Persian, Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Serbian, Czech, Polish, Romanian, Somali. This application offers audio narrations, not dramatized versions. Portuguese narration in European Portuguese.\n\nThe application comes with the default in English and all other languages are easily and automatically installed with one click, according to the needs of the user. The text in any language takes 30 seconds or less to download and gets automatically installed, you just need to have your device connected through Wi-Fi or DATA. Audio chapters can be streamed, and heard in any language when you are connected to Wi-Fi or DATA, or may be download into your device for use offline anytime, anywhere.\n\nThe audio download is available book by book, which means that even if you have limited space, you can download a book (i.e. Genesis), use it for awhile, and then uninstall it and download a new one - this can be done in any of the 36 languages available with both text and audio. If you have plenty of space in your device, then you may download the whole Audio Bible - if you wish to.\n\nTo use the audio continuous play option more effectively, please note that you should set the app to continuous play. Usually in iOS devices, the screen needs to be always on for the audio continuous play to be in effect. In that case, we also recommend that you use the brightness level  to adjust the brightness to a minimum. That way you can enjoy listen to the Bible for several hours and keep your battery. Of course if you plug your device to the power outlet you can listen to the Bible all day…\n\nThe purpose of this application is to make the Word available to as many people as possible, so new languages might be available in future versions.\n\nFor more audio and text Bibles, please visit the original Wordproject site: http://www.wordproject.org"

This work was originally done in Arabic by “Maulana Muhammad Yusuf Kandhlawi (Rahimahullah)”, during the last phase of his devoted life. He collected all the relevant principles, rules and precautions from their original sources. He has been so comprehensive and extensive that this book is not merely a compilation of these principles, rules and instructions, but perhaps an encyclopedia, in brief, with their relative importance. This masterpiece was later organised and translated into Urdu by his grandson, Maulana Muhammad Sa'ad Kandhlawi (Muttalilluhul Aali).\n\nMunthakhab Ahadees was translated into Tamil by “Maulana Muhammad Roohul Haq Sahib”, which is a ready reference to guide the mankind towards the righteousness and enjoining the good and forbidden all evil deeds for the development and construction of an ideal society.\n\nNow, Munthakhab Ahadees is available as an iOS Application, enabling English and Tamil Speaking iOS Users to read and gain acknowledge on the go.\n\nThis is the official iOS Application of Munthakhab Ahadees, originally published as a hard copy by Darul Marashid, a non profit organisation.\n\nThe word \"Munthakhab / Muntakab / Munthakab / Muntakhab\" is an Arabic word, which is translated in English as \"Selected\".\n\nThe word \"Ahadeeth / Ahadith / Ahadees\" is also an Arabic word, which is translated in English as \"Sayings of Prophet Muhammadh (peace be upon him)\".

You will see how much you are absorbed in the content of the text, when you realize all the advantages of not having to move your eyes while reading in unnatural directions.\n\nThe speed reading technique, in our book reader Bookva, will help increase the speed reading technique from the standard 250 words per minute, the average person, to 600-700 words per minute, and even more.\n\nReading in Bookva should not create discomfort; if so, then you are using this technology incorrectly. Don't rush to speed up. You will understand when you need to read faster - when you feel that the current speed has become too slow for you. Your increasing speed is the perfect test of reading technique.\n\nThe key to space reading technique and speed is regular practice. Practice every day according to our speed reading method and you will see the first results in a week. Just remember that reading should be fun. And we will take care of \"feeding\" the words to your brain in the form in which it expects to see them.\n\nSupported book formats:\n- epub.\n\nFormats Coming Soon:\n- txt, FB2, RTF, PDF, DJVU, MOBI, AZW3, CBR, CBZ, CBT.\n\nDownload a reader to increase speed reading - Bookva.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=BHGpgjxohI3M8jzvtkteI0bNFCI9haax\n\nTerms of use: https://www.app-privacy-policy.com/live.php?token=5gAD833X4nHh7g1vOIEGgVDsQMq10ZJ9"

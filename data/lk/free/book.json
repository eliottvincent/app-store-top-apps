Kindle books you have purchased on Amazon will automatically appear in your app. Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime members can select and download Kindle books directly in the app.\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT GREAT READ\n• Read the books you buy on Amazon in the Kindle app. Choose from over six million Kindle books (including those with Audible narration), magazines, and comics and start reading in seconds. Explore Amazon Charts best sellers and titles across genres like romance, science fiction, children’s books, self-help, religion, nonfiction, and more—and try any book with a free sample straight from the Kindle app.\n\n• Kindle Unlimited members can enjoy unlimited reading and listening, with the freedom to explore over 1 million titles, thousands of audiobooks, and current magazines. \n\n• Over 1,000 books, magazines, comics, and more included with Amazon Prime.\n\n• Kindle Vella brings you stories released one short episode at a time. The first three episodes of every story are always free--after that, purchase Tokens and redeem them to unlock episodes. Tokens may only be used to unlock Kindle Vella story episodes and are available for In-App purchase. Kindle Vella and In-App purchase of Tokens are currently only available in the US. \n\nGO BEYOND PAPER\nTurn your iPhone or iPad into a book with the free Kindle app—so you can read anytime, anywhere. Explore these reading features in the Kindle app:\n\n• Read your way. Customize your text size, font type, margins, text alignment, and orientation (portrait or landscape)—and choose whether to turn pages from left to right or continuously scroll. Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com\n\nAs the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter. \n\n\nمن صناع Quran.com يأتي تطبيق القرآن للأجهزة المحمولة، تطبيق للمصحف ذو صفحات جميلة خالي تماما من الاعلانات.\n\nلقد أصبح من السهل قراءة القرآن بالشارع، وحفظه، والاستماع إلى قارئك المفضل.\n\nهذا هو مجرد بداية لتطبيق القرآن. سنعمل على تحديث التطبيق بشكل منتظم إن شاء الله، ونحب أن نسمع رأيك ومتطلبتك. يمكنك الوصول إلينا عن طريق البريد الإلكتروني ios@quran.com\n\nعَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة."

      "label": "This app brings you most of the lyrics used by Tamil churches all over the world. Now, you can sing songs of praise and thanksgiving to God with all the lyrics you need in an elegantly designed app that doesn't display any ads.\n\nWhy develop another app when there are tons of similar apps?\nWorship Songs was initially developed as we couldn't find an app with both Tamil and Transliterated (Romanised) text. \nNow, our vision has grown to bring all the good quality songs Tamil Christians use to praise and thank God in one easy to use app that doesn't display any advertisements.\n\nMany Tamil congregations also sing English songs. Worship Songs provides many popular English songs as well, so you need not look for another app. \n\nAnd finally, the song database grows rapidly. New songs are added often, so you will never miss your favourite song. We would like to add a word that we are extremely careful in our song selection. We do not want to add all the songs out there in the wild but only good quality ones that's scriptural.\n\nDid we mention that Worship Songs is open source? Yes, you can be a part of this project. Isn't that great?\n\nFEATURES\n\n- A large collection of Tamil and English songs, Jebathotta Jeyageethangal, Keerthanaigal, Seyalveerar Geethangal (FMPB), Sarah Navaroji songs etc.\n- Transliterated (Romanised) text for Tamil songs\n- Songs grouped by Titles, Authors, Categories, Song Books\n- Ability to quickly search for a song by its title or content or song number in a Song Book\n- Manage your favourite list of songs through \"Favourites\". This will help you to organize songs that will be used in next Sunday service, Small Group meetings or simply to manage your favourite list.\n- \"Present song\" on your TV or projector wireless (Miracast/WiDi) or via HDMI cable connection (MHL, SlimPort or Micro-HDMI port).\n- YouTube video support for selected songs.\n- Share your favourite song or a verse from a song to Whatsapp, Facebook etc\n- Ability to use your own song database (in OpenLP db format) hosted in GitHub, Dropbox shared folder etc..\n- Professional design with no ads.\n\nFAQ\n\nQ. I couldn't find a song that I am looking for. What should I do?\n\nRefine your search terms. For example, instead of \"Arathanai\", try searching for \"Aarathanai\". Worship Songs names the song titles that matches closely with their Tamil counterparts.\n\nQ. I still couldn't find the song. I bet it's not there in your database. What now?\n\nYou can create a new issue at our Github project https://github.com/mcruncher/worshipsongs-db-dev. Worship Songs is an open source project. Anyone interested can contribute song lyrics. If you are interested, please let us know.\n\nQ. I want to request a new feature. How do I go about that?\n\nThe songs database and the app are maintained in separate Github projects. Worship Songs for iOS lives at https://github.com/mcruncher/worshipsongs-ios. You can request for a new feature by creating an issue there. Or you can use the Feedback feature within the app to communicate with us.\n\nQ. How do I report bugs?\n\nPlease create an issue and apply the label \"Bug\" in our Github project. Kindly refer the previous question for project details. Please do not report bugs through comments.\n\nQ. How can I help you guys?\n\nIf you find Worship Songs to be useful, please give it a good rating and share your opinion. Please help others know about this app by spreading word. You can contribute song lyrics or if you are good at iOS development, you can contribute code.\n\nQ. Is there a way I can use these songs in my Church?\n\nAbsolutely. In fact, the songs database that is shipped with this app is used by Tamil Methodist Church Subang Jaya. \nIf you want to do that in your Church, you would need to install a software named OpenLP and replace it's default songs database with the one that ships with this app.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\n- Copyrighted songs are owned by respective Copyright holders.\n- Linked YouTube videos are owned by respective Copyright holders."

      "label": "Sherlock Holmes is a fictional private detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Known as a \"consulting detective\" in the stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.\n\n\nFirst appearing in print in 1887 (in A Study in Scarlet), the character's popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then to 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, taking place between about 1880 to 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.\n\n\nThough not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the most well-known, with Guinness World Records listing him as the \"most portrayed movie character\" in history. Holmes's popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but a real individual; numerous literary and fan societies have been founded that pretend to operate on this principle. Widely considered a British cultural icon, the character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with both the original tales as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.\n\nThe work shown in this app is in public domain.\nsource : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#Copyright_issues"

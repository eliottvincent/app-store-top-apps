See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.\n\nBy using this app, you agree to Amazon’s Conditions of Use (www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse) and Privacy Notice (www.amazon.com/privacy)."

We’ll be updating the app regularly insha'Allah and would love to hear your feedback and feature requests. You can reach us at ios@quran.com\n\nAs the Hadeeth (prophetic statement) in At-Tirmithi states: “Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah, he will have a reward, and this reward will be multiplied by ten. I am not saying that 'Alif, Laam, Meem' (a combination of letters frequently mentioned in the Holy Quran) is a letter, rather I am saying that ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘Laam’ is a letter and ‘Meem’ is a letter.” [At-Tirmithi] We hope this app will help you increase your recitation of the Quran and increase your blessings in this world and the hereafter. \n\n\nمن صناع Quran.com يأتي تطبيق القرآن للأجهزة المحمولة، تطبيق للمصحف ذو صفحات جميلة خالي تماما من الاعلانات.\n\nلقد أصبح من السهل قراءة القرآن بالشارع، وحفظه، والاستماع إلى قارئك المفضل.\n\nهذا هو مجرد بداية لتطبيق القرآن. سنعمل على تحديث التطبيق بشكل منتظم إن شاء الله، ونحب أن نسمع رأيك ومتطلبتك. يمكنك الوصول إلينا عن طريق البريد الإلكتروني ios@quran.com\n\nعَنْ ابْنِ مَسْعُودٍ قَالَ : قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ { مَنْ قَرَأَ حَرْفًا مِنْ كِتَابِ اللَّهِ فَلَهُ حَسَنَةٌ وَالْحَسَنَةُ بِعَشْرِ أَمْثَالِهَا, لَا أَقُولُ الم حَرْفٌ, وَلَكِنْ أَلِفٌ حَرْفٌ, وَلَامٌ حَرْفٌ,وَمِيمٌ حَرْفٌ }. رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ. ونحن نأمل أن يساعدك هذا التطبيق على زيادة قراءتك للقرآن وزيادة حسناتك في الدنيا والآخرة."

      "label": "If you dream of writing a book even a bestselling book, you’re in the right place!\nThis is a structured simple and clear program that will guide you through the writing process. We break down the process so that anyone will have the opportunity to write a book. We will show you how to make sure it is a good book, with a good plot, good structure, and good writing.\n\nYou may want to practice novel writing or maybe write a kids book, it could be an autobiography or science fiction, Either way, every author and book creator has to go through some steps in order to see the book finished and in the stores.\n\nHere you’ll learn 10 simple lessons to write a book plus an additional 10 bonus tips, a guide on how to find a publisher for your book, how to stay motivated when you write a book and more.\n\nThe lesson of this “how to write a book?” program:\n* Phase 1 of writing a book - Getting started\nDecide what the book is about - Great book writing is constantly referring to something. Write the conflict of your book in a sentence\nBuild a storyboard for your plot, decide on a book maker or a book creator software.\nSet a daily word count goal - A page a day is just about 300 words. You do not need to write a whole lot.\nSet a time to work on your book writing every day- Uniformity makes creativity and imagination a whole lot easier.\nSet the same place every time when you write a book\n\n* Phase 2 of writing a book: Doing the work\nSet a total word count\nGive yourself weekly deadlines\nGet early feedback - Nothing hurts even worse than writing a publication and after that needing to have to rewrite it since you didn't allow no one has a look at it.\n\n* Phase 3 of writing a book: Finishing\nExactly how do you know when you're done? Short answer: you don't. Not really. So below is what you do to end this book-writing procedure well\nCommit to shipping - Finish the book at all costs. Set a deadline or have actually one being set for you\nEmbrace failure - As you approach the completion of this task, understand that this will be difficult as well as you will certainly definitely mess up\nWrite another book - The majority of authors are embarrassed by their very first book. But without that initial book, you will certainly never learn the lessons you might or else miss out on them.\n\n* The reason most people never finish their books\nEvery year, millions of books go unfinished. Books that could have helped people, brought beauty or wisdom into the world. But they never came to be. And in one way or another, the reason is always the same: the author quit. We will show you how you can avoid it and finish the book writing.\n\n* 10 book writing tips\nWhen you write a book you need sometimes help to stay motivated, we have 10 tips to help you keep going in the process.\n\n* How to Get Your Book Published\nOK, you finished writing a book, you are an author! now, If you want to get your book published, you have more choices than ever to accomplish your goal, and the path can be confusing if you’re new to the publishing industry. This lesson lays out the process in the simplest terms possible.\nThere are three primary paths to getting published:\nLand a traditional publisher who will offer you a book contract.\nHire a service to help you publish your book. \nSelf-publish by the author: self publishing may be harder to do but you'll earn more for every book you sell.\n\n* Finding the traditional publisher\nIn a traditional publishing arrangement, the publisher pays you for the right to publish your work. Traditional publishers assume all costs and pay you an advance and royalties. You must persuade them to accept your work by delivering an effective pitch or manuscript.\nDifferent publishers have different expertise. Some work with novel books, others with kids books, autobiographies, action, romance, science fiction, etc.\n\n* Prepare your submission materials for the publishing company.\n\nSo... are you ready to make a dream come true?\nDownload now!"

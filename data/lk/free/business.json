The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly.

The free GoToWebinar mobile app lets you not only see and hear webinars, but take part in them as well. No matter where you are, you can ask questions, take part in polls and more. If you’re running the webinar, you can present directly from your iPad, share your iPad’s webcam and chat with other event staff.\n\nFEATURES\n\nFor Attendees\nAttend and participate in online events while you’re on the move.\n   •  Join easily by tapping the online event link in an invite email or your calendar.\n   •  Use a single tap to dial in to the phone conference or connect to audio using WiFi or 4G/3G.\n   •  View the event speaker’s slide presentations up close.\n   •  Participate in polls, raise your hand and ask the event speaker a question.\n   •  View up to 6 webcams on any iOS device. \n\nFor Organizers\nIn addition to the above, as an organizer you can\n   • Schedule Webinars\n   • View previously scheduled Webinars\n   • View the number of registrants for an upcoming Webinar\n   • Share a Webinar registration link via email, SMS, twitter, facebook and more.\n\nFor Panelists\nIn addition to the above, as a panelist you can use your iPad to\n   • Share your webcam\n   • Share a document from your favorite cloud storage app\n   • Chat with other panelists and organizers\n\nHOW TO JOIN AN EVENT\nThere is no purchase necessary to attend a GoToWebinar event. Two easy ways to join:\n   • Tap an event link in the invite email or your calendar.\n   • Tap the GoToWebinar icon after you download the app and enter the session ID.\nNOTE: Presenter controls can be passed to anyone in the event if they have content to share. If you’re using an iPad, you can access and present content stored on cloud services.\n\nAUDIO\n   • Upon joining an event, you will automatically connect to audio through your Internet connection (WiFi or 4G/3G).\n   • For the best audio experience, plug a headset into your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.\n   • If you prefer to dial in over your phone line, you can do that with a single tap after joining the event. \n   • If you are attending the event in person, easily disconnect from audio any time so you can continue to participate in polls and see the speaker’s presentation up close.\nNOTE: Due to network constraints, iPhone users on the Verizon network will be unable to join the event and dial in over the phone at the same time.\n\nVIDEO CONFERENCING\nIf additional presenters are using webcams, you will automatically see them upon joining the event. \n   • GoToWebinar presenters can turn on webcams by tapping the webcam icon then the Share My Webcam button.\n   • While it is possible to stream video over a 4G/3G connection, WiFi is recommended to avoid charges with your network carrier."

      "label": "Salesforce Authenticator adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts as a strong, out-of-band authentication provider. The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

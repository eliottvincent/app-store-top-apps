      "label": "A simple tool for businesses to talk to their customers. — WhatsApp Business from Meta\n\nWhatsApp Business enables you to have a business presence on WhatsApp, communicate more efficiently with your customers, and help you grow your business.\n\nIf you have separate business and personal phone numbers, you can have both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger installed on the same phone, and register them with different numbers.\n\nIn addition to the features available in WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Business includes:\n\n• BUSINESS PROFILE: Create a profile for your business to help your customers find valuable information — like your website, location, or contact information.\n\n• BUSINESS MESSAGING TOOLS: Be more responsive to your customers by using Away messages to indicate that you're away.\n\n• LANDLINE/FIXED NUMBER SUPPORT: You can use WhatsApp Business with a landline (or fixed) phone number and your customers can message you on that number. During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

The only way to record calls on iOS devices is to create a 3-way call with a recording number.\n\n\nThis app includes an auto renewing subscription “Standard Subscription” option in order to access all functionality: \n- Subscription options are either every weekly, monthly or yearly \n- Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. \n- Subscription automatically renews unless the subscription is cancelled at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n - Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n - You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n- When canceling a subscription, your subscription will stay active until the end of the subscription period and you will have access to all the content that you subscribed to. Auto-renewal will be disabled and you will not be charged again, but the current subscription will not be refunded.\n- You may be eligible to sign up for a trial period to evaluate the app. Please note that at the end of the trial period you will be billed for the subscription amount and the subscription will automatically renew.\n- Any unused portion of a trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when purchasing a subscription. \nPrivacy Policy and Terms of Use are available at:  \n- http://prettyboamedia.com/privacy-policy/ \n- http://prettyboamedia.com/terms-conditions/\n\nWe are constantly improving this app and we would love to hear your suggestions for improvement!

      "label": "Salesforce Authenticator adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts as a strong, out-of-band authentication provider. The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

You can go back and review the questions that you got wrong.\n• Passing Probability score is calculated in real-time based on your activity and displays how you'd score on the official G1 test if you took it today.\n• Multiple difficulty levels: Study at your own pace as you move from Easy to the Exam Simulator.\n• Simple and fun to use: We’ve simplified the vague and complex language of driving rules so you can quickly master the concepts and answer the question correctly next time, no matter how it’s worded on the exam.\n• Works offline: no internet connection needed.\n• Detailed explanations reveal the \"why\" behind every answer. For each question, you’ll see an explanation of the right answer immediately.\n• Smart hints help with tricky questions and steer you in the right direction.\nG1 Genie is the perfect practice app for beginners, but it also includes plenty of challenging G1 practice questions for renewal applicants and advanced drivers.

I passed with flying colours and it’s the closest thing you can get to taking the actual test in advance. So worth it!\" - Terry G., Markham\n\"Just study with this every day for like 30 mins, and when you write the actual exam, you'll be fine.\" - Jaden Bediako, Team Canada, National basketball player\nPremium membership pricing and terms:\nG1 Genie offers a one-time Premium Lifetime membership to provide you with unlimited access to the training materials, which is paid for by a one-off upfront payment with unlimited access to the full functionality forever.\nHave questions, problems, or feedback?

      "label": "Why You Need This Driving Licence App:\nG1 ontario is the #1 app for G1 test prep so you'll pass the first time. It's the fastest way to prepare.\nDriving is awesome but passing the G1 test shouldn't be so complex. We make it easy for you to be fully prepared by providing easy-to-use tools to make studying effortless and fun. Rather than try to memorize boring facts and numbers, get comfortable answering exam-like questions that range from easy to knuckle-cracking hard. You won’t even notice you're studying; you’ll want to keep taking the tests until you pass them all.\n\nJoin the thousands of Ontario learner drivers who passed their G1 written test using this app. With G1, you’ll breeze through your exam and walk out of the DriveTest center, feeling like you just took a first-grade spelling test.\n\nTake your G1 ontario prep to the next level with the super-realistic Exam, Handbook, wrong answered question test, and more. Recommended by top driving schools and independent driving instructors.\n\nDownload it right now, be ready to ace your G1 exam tomorrow.\n\nWhat you’ll love about G1:\n\n• All 290 exam-like questions based on the Ontario Driver's Handbook and seen on the official exam.\n• The realistic G1 Exams is as close as it gets to the actual G1 driver's test experience. It mimics the experience of a real G1 test.\n• Re-Solve is a new type of test that's automatically made up of your missed questions from all your practice tests. You can go back and review the questions that you got wrong.\n• Passing Probability score is calculated in real time based on your activity and displays how you'd score on the official G1 test if you took it today.\n• Simple and fun to use: We’ve simplified the vague and complex language of driving rules so you can quickly master the concepts and answer the question correctly next time, no matter how it’s worded on the exam.\n• Works offline: no internet connection needed.\n\nG1 is the perfect practice app for beginners, but it also includes plenty of challenging G1 practice questions for renewal applicants and advanced drivers. Every question is based on the official Driver's Handbook issued by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario so you can be sure you're studying the most recent materials.\n\nOur users swear that most of the questions on the real G1 test are very similar (often identical) to those G1 offers. You’ll know exactly what to expect since our practice tests have the same scoring system as the actual G1 test.\n\n\"Really prepares you for the G1 test. I passed with flying colours and it’s the closest thing you can get to taking the actual test in advance. So worth it!\" - Terry G., Markham\n\n\"Just study with this every day for like 30 mins and when you write the actual exam you'll be fine.\" - Jaden Bediako, Team Canada, National basketball player\n\nYou'll be surprised how close the app is to the real thing!"

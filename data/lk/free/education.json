Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

      "label": "Designed for Japanese second-language learners. Whether you're learning your first kanji, or skip 2000 you've already mastered to start, it adapts to your knowledge level and time commitments.\n\nPERSONALIZED STUDY:\n\nSet a goal of how many kanji you'd like to learn each day. The app creates a personalized study plan based on what memories you need to strengthen, based on proven learning techniques like spaced repetition.\n\nKanji you forget will be reviewed more often, while enough correct reviews will fill up its progress ring—which means you won't review it again for a full year. This allows you to maintain progress for hundreds and even thousands of kanji at once, while maintaining a reasonable amount to study each day.\n\nSMARTER REVIEWING:\n\nGet tested on all the common readings for each kanji. Kanji Garden uses vocabulary words made of kanji you've already learned to test in context. Multiple choice answers include commonly confused answers to help you catch your mistakes. Or type in kanji readings to practice Japanese input.\n\nBETTER LEARNING ORDER:\n\nKanji Garden is built on a simple idea: Learn all the components for a kanji first. When you can break down a character into its components, even kanji with many strokes become easy to recognize. Plus it enables you to take advantage of phono-semantic components that give hints at what the character means, and what it sounds like:\n\n建: Build\n健: Health (亻:Person + 建:Build)\n鍵: Key (金:metal + 建:Build)\n\nHere, 建 is a phonetic component. Now you know all three have the same on'yomi ケン (ken)!\n\nThere's also a heavy focus on easily confused kanji. Kanji Garden teaches these characters together and tests you on their differences to ensure you know how to differentiate them from the start, saving a lot of pain down the road.\n\n料: Material\n科: Department\n\nAMAZING STATS:\n\nVisualize your unlocked kanji history or upcoming reviews on the graph. Track your learning streak and earn grace days as you study more. Time travel through your learning history, and save a wallpaper image or animated video of your current progress."

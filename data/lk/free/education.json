Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

      "label": "If you have chosen to study Korean, then an interesting but difficult journey awaits you. Like all languages in Asia, Korean is one of the most popular languages to learn around the world. Korean can be used not only in South or North Korea, but in Japan and China. Learning Korean will help you become more familiar with Korean culture, Korean music, Korean dramas (dorama) and movies.\r\nAnd, as everyone knows, it's important to start learning Korean from the basics. One of the main elements of any language is Korean numbers, as numbers play an important role in our lives and are widely used every day.\r\nIn order to help you achieve meaningful and fast results in your Korean language and Korean numbers, we have created a completely new app. Our app will help you learn Korean numbers in a new way thanks to a special algorithm.\r\nInside our application, you will see:\r\n- learning numbers tests. This section contains a large number of tests to practice and improve your Korean language skills. Before starting training, you need to choose the form of writing numbers in the task (alphabetic or numeric). After that, you must select the range of numbers to study. Then you can start testing.\r\n- quick tests. Here you can also select the range of numbers to study. After that, you immediately start assignments. Thanks to optimization, our application is very fast. Therefore, you will be able to quickly pass these tests using every free minute.\r\n- math tests. This is one of the most interesting and useful sections of our application. Mathematical tests provide an opportunity not only to mechanically give an answer to a question. Before you find out the number required for translation, you must solve a small math problem. Also, you can choose the form of writing the number (digital or alphabetic). You must enter the number received after solving the problem in the answer field.\r\n- logical tests. This type of test will help you to better train your skills. You will be given a sequence of three numbers. Logically, you must find the fourth number and enter it in the answer field. It's very easy!\r\nUsing math and logic tests, you will significantly improve your knowledge of Korean numbers and bring them to automatism.\r\nIf you love keeping track of your progress, then you will definitely love the statistics feature. You will be able to see it after each test option.\r\nTo quickly convert Korean numbers from digital to alphabetic, we have added a number converter. With it, you can translate a number and test your knowledge of Korean numbers.\r\nOur app is suitable for all ages. You can use it to teach Korean to your children.\r\nYou can learn Korean numbers with our app yourself. It will also be a good addition if you are studying Korean in school, college, university or language courses.\r\nOur app can be used for any level of Korean (even as Korean for beginners). It will be very convenient for you to keep your knowledge up to date.\r\nWith knowledge of Korean numbers, you will greatly improve your Korean grammar. This will help you get started speaking Korean quickly and bring you closer to the level of a native speaker.\r\nIt is very important to regularly use our application every day, because regularity is important to consolidate knowledge."

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time.

There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go.

Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

Introduce you to Real English that is essential to every day English conversations \n2. Have you say variations of each phrase so many times you say it without thinking \n3. Simulate real situations where you’d actually use it \n\nWhenever you’re using Speak, you’ll be speaking a ton — and the app will always be listening and providing feedback to make sure you fix mistakes. \n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go in a pool instead of reading a swimming book, if you want to get good at Speaking English, you’re gonna have to start actually speaking and do it every day! Speak makes this realistic.\n\n--\n\nIf you have any feedback or questions, please contact us at feedback@usespeak.com. \n\nSPEAK MEMBERSHIP\n\nSpeak offers both monthly and annual auto-renewing subscriptions.

      "label": "Tea, coconut, and rubber are considered as major crops in Sri Lanka. All the supervision & operational activities related to these crops are carried out by the Ministry of Plantation Industries. Several institutions have established for the betterment of the field of coconut cultivation. Among them, the Coconut Cultivation Board takes a prominent place. The key objective of the Coconut Cultivation Board is to uplift the production of coconut and productivity and to establish sustainable coconut cultivation by providing necessary input and financial facilities to coconut growers island-wide through an efficient extension & advisory service. Currently, it has spread over million acres of land island-wide, which means both as a domestic crop and as a commercial crop. Coconut Cultivation Board has a limited number of Coconut Development Officers to provide new technical information and services to coconut growers. This situation is the main issue encountered by the Board.\nLaunching a mobile application is another revolutionary step taken by the Coconut Cultivation Board to make efficiency in extension service by using modern technical methods. In modern society, mobile phones are strongly attached to the lifestyle of people. The majority of the countries in the world have used mobile phone communication technology to create an optimistic influence on social, economic and cultural aspects. Among a large number of mobile applications utilized in the present society, applications related to agriculture have taken much popularity.\nCurrently, there is no official mobile application in Sri Lanka to provide descriptive information on technical services related to coconut cultivation. To fill this void, the Coconut Cultivation Board created a new mobile application called “Coconut App”. Coconut growers can install this application free-of-charge. This application has divided technical information related to coconut cultivation into two layers; all the details are provided in a precise and simple manner that can be understood by ordinary people and the relevant documents can be downloaded for the benefit of any individual either for commercial purpose or academic purpose.\nThis mobile application provides information on various field activities related to coconut cultivation, various diseases and pest control methods, services provided by Coconut Cultivation Board and expenses about all the field activities related to coconut cultivation to coconut growers through several packages. In addition, the coconut grower can watch some short videos for further information on diseases and pests related to coconut cultivation.\nThis application also facilitates the grower to register and obtain services provided by the Coconut Cultivation Board, gather information about the places by which necessary inputs can be purchased and directions to those places. Coconut growers can submit the issues encountered at the field related to coconut cultivation in words, as a voice message, picture or videotape and obtain the assistance of relevant technical officers with immediate effect. Although a certain amount of data will spend to install the application, the users can use it offline while the location of the grower can be tracked when using."

      "label": "If you want to improve your study and work efficiency, we recommend a super-concentration study timer that can record time! A dedicated timer for the Pomodoro Technique, which \"easily keeps you focused\", and a comfortable background music of natural sounds like the sound of waves that bring out \"alpha waves\" will lead you to a [super-concentrated state]!\n\nThis app is a free study timer app that allows you to practice the Pomodoro Technique, which has already changed the lives of millions of people internationally, with just one tap.\n\nIt is also ideal as a background music app for study and work, a time recording app, and a remaining days count app!\n\n\n◆◇ What is the Pomodoro method (Pomodoro technique)?\nA time management technique devised by Italian entrepreneur and author Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s.\n\nIt's very easy to do.\n\nOne set consists of 25 minutes of concentration and 5 minutes of rest, and you can repeat up to 4 sets. After that, take a slightly longer break of 20-45 minutes.\n\nIt's a very simple time management system, but it can greatly increase your productivity, help you focus and help you reach your goals.\n\n\n◆◇ How to use the app\nDecide on focus time, break time, number of sets,\nJust start the timer!\n\n* Since it is a repeat timer, no troublesome work is required!\n* No need to press a button every time you take a break or refocus.\n* If you start with the same menu every time, you can manage time with one tap!\n* Notify the end of focus time and break time by alarm.\n\n\n◆◇ Find a focus time that suits you!\nA typical set is 25 minutes of focus and 5 minutes of break, with a maximum of 4 sets. However, if you feel that 25 minutes is too long for your focus time, try adjusting your focus time to 15 minutes and your break time to 3 minutes.\n\nIf you can't do 4 sets due to time constraints, you can change the number of sets. Please adjust according to your physical condition and time.\n\n\n◆◇ Why does background music of natural sounds improve concentration?\nFirst of all, alpha waves are one of the brain waves that often appear when the mind and body are in a state of relaxation or concentration.\nOne way to draw out alpha waves is to listen to music that contains a rhythm called \"1/f fluctuation.\"\nThe rhythm of \"1/f fluctuation\" is included in natural sounds such as the sound of waves, the sound of rain, and the murmuring of a river, as well as music box sounds. And the rhythm can be expected to have effects such as healing and concentration improvement from comfort. \n\n\n◆◇ Change the background music according to your taste and mood!\nFive kinds of comfortable background music are available. Choose according to your taste and mood, draw out alpha waves, and show your concentration.\n\n1．WAVE [Wave sounds x Music Box]\n2．RAIN [Rain Sounds x Music Box]\n3．FIRE [Bonfire Sounds x Guitar]\n4．RIVER[River Sounds x Piano]\n5．CAFE [Ambient sound × Jazz]\n+　NO SOUND\n\n\n◆◇ Visualization of time records in a graph \"Calendar\"\n- Graph display of focused time on calendar.\n- Total time and average time displayed by month.\n- Note function.\n\nNot only can you see at a glance the time you focused on, but you can also use it for review and future improvements!\n\n\n◆◇ \"Countdown\" raises awareness\n- Countdown the remaining days until the big day\n- Motivate yourself by registering goals for tests and exams\n\nNot only can you know how many days are left, but the deadline effect will improve your concentration!\n\n\nStudy Timer supports all those who study and work with a positive attitude, such as \"I want to improve my grades!\", \"I want to pass my exams!\", and \"I want to increase my productivity!\"!\n\nIt's never too early to start something. The number of days left until the test and exam date will definitely decrease.\n\nThis app can be used for free without any monthly charges, so please feel free to try it!\nPeople who have trouble concentrating have practiced this method of time, and it has produced results.\n\n\nGet the future you want with your own power!"

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

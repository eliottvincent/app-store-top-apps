      "label": "Pin Balls UP – Puzzles and gardening combined!\n\nAre you a puzzle fan who also loves gardening? Ever wondered how you could combine your two favorite hobbies into one major grand adventure? You could always grow a hedge maze, of course, but it would take a while and not all of us have the space. Or sit in your yard doing jigsaw puzzles, but what happens when a nasty rain hits the skies? Well, now there’s finally another option — you can test your logic  in tricky physics-based puzzles while also tending a garden of beautiful pot plants as they blossom and grow in this fun and original game.\n\nGive your plants the food they need!\n\n- Slide pins and move sections to guide the little colored nutrient balls down the pipe to your hungry plants. Autogenerated levels means an endless stream of new puzzle challenges and the chance to go on earning rewards and upgrading your garden endlessly.\n\n- Over 30 puzzle-game mechanisms give your logic a real workout. Make sure the balls don’t escape, multiply their number on the way down, and avoid hazards including fire and explosions to ensure your little green friends get the goodness they need.\n\n- Delightful original graphics, fun animations, and beautiful sound design enhance your puzzle-solving entertainment. Plus, extensive personalization options include over 50 different skins for balls and 50 different designs of pins, so you can ensure your puzzles are aesthetically pleasing as well as rewarding.\n\n- Collect two galleries of flowers and nine different plants — sunflower, anthurium, cactus, myosotis, narcissus, pansy, protea, strelitzia, and tulip . Then tend, feed, and combine them to lead them through a unique sequence of growing stages till they finally blossom in a riot of gorgeous blooms.\n\n- Don’t forget the watering! In this game, watering isn’t just an essential gardening exercise, it’s also a way to boost your idle income. And it’s not the only one: there are loads of other ways to get free bonuses including bonus levels with free coins and coin rewards for returning players.\n\nGardening was never this much fun!\n\nEngage your puzzle-game brain, get your nimble green fingers moving and escape into hours of logic fun. Work with the laws of physics and plot the optimal course for the balls, then let them loose, and watch as they shoot down the pipes with an immensely satisfying clatter."

Every one of the guidelines, scoring strategies, the quantity of players-as in the actual game have been included in this application. This application is a solitary player game.The part of the other three players is played by the system itself. Toward the end, the group who got 10 tokens will be the winning group of the Oombi game. At each round, managing change and trump suit picking chance turn among every player. The system players will play the ideal card by considering the cards that other players have played. As a real game, tokens will be allotted to the winning side.\n\nPlayers and card\n\nThere are four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. Deal and play are counter-clockwise. A standard international 52-card pack is used, but only 32 of the cards are used for play. These cards rank from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 in each suit. Other cards are used as tokens. Tokens are awarded to the winning side.\n\nDeal and making trumps\nPlayer to your left will deal first, and the turn to deal passes to the right after each hand. The dealer shuffles the 32-card pack and deals a batch of four cards to each player.\n\nThe player to dealer’s right looks at the four cards and must decide and announce which suit will be trumped.The dealer then deals a second batch of four cards to each player, so that everyone gets eight.\n\nHow to play\n\nThe player to dealer's right, who announced the trump suit, leads any card to the first trick. The other players play in turn, anticlockwise around the table, and must follow suit if able to; a player who holds no card of the suit led may play any card.\n\nIf no trumps are played, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit that was led. If any trumps were played the highest trump wins the trick. The winner of the trick gathers the four cards, stacks them face down in the team's trick pile, and leads any card to the next trick.\n\n\nScoring\n\nAfter the eighth trick, the tricks won by each team are counted.\nIf the team that chose the trump suit have 5, 6 or 7 tricks, they win one token.\nIf the team that did not choose the trump suit have 5, 6 or 7 tricks, they win two tokens.\nIf either team wins all 8 tricks, they win three tokens. This is known as “Kapothi”.\nIf the teams take 4 tricks each, no token cards are transferred, but an extra token card is won the next time a team takes more than 4 tricks.\nThe winners are the first team to win 10 or more tokens"

      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

Each style adds expert keywords to help you create incredible AI-generated paintings, photographs, and drawings. The best part? You get dozens of results for free.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Describe what you want to create. Be descriptive and creative or even use the built-in text scanner to pull a passage from a book. \n\n2. Pick a style. We’ve curated each style to add hyper-specific text to compose prompts that lead to the best outcomes. This is one of the hardest parts of generating AI images and Creator's styles ensure that you generate great results every time. \n\n3. Get incredible images for free. You’ll see an infinite number of generations. And we'll never show you any annoying ads. Depending on the style you picked, we'll instantly show you images from a massive library of millions of expert-generated AI images. If you want something more unique, we'll send your prompt to a different AI model (such as Dall-E or Stable Diffusion.) Through this approach, we can instantly provide an unparalleled number of high-quality options.\n\nWhat makes Creator different?\nOur goal is to simplify the world of AI-generated art and photos. We give you the best outcome, with the simplest method, for the best price. We give you more free access than any other app and we don't make you sit through ads to get them.\n\nPrompt writing is also an art, so our styles will add descriptive text to your prompts to help improve your images. Here’s an example:\n\nYou type \"futuristic car flying through space\".\nYou select a style that looks like a painting.\nThe prompt becomes: futuristic car flying through space, oil painting, organic lighting, godrays, high contrast, denoised, intricate detail, studio quality, cinematic lighting, vivid colors, HQ, award winning, incredible, gorgeous.\n\nEach style has different terms that we've found lead to incredible results and we'll give you dozens of images to choose from - so you're not stuck paying for images you don't like. Once you find an image you love, you can update the aspect ratio or even upscale the resolution. Save it as a lock-screen wallpaper, share it with your friends, print a poster, or post it on social media and go viral.\n\nOr just keep trying different prompts to see what the AI comes up with. The possibilities, and fun, are endless.\n\nA few unique things about Creator:\n\n- Dozens of results for free. Free users can see lots of different results from a single prompt. By integrating multiple models into our app, we’re able to provide an experience that makes our app the most user-friendly on the market.\n\n- Instant results and no ads. Creator displays results almost instantly. And you will never have to sit through an ad to use it — even on the free plan.\n\n- Expert generated prompts. AI art has a language of its own. We learned that language so you don’t have to.\n\n- Ultra-high-resolution outputs. We use an AI-upscaling model to turn images into print-worthy creations. A 512 x 512 output can be upscaled to over 6k pixels.\n\n- Aspect-ratio controls. Change the aspect ratio and crop the image within a container. Create different assets for different platforms to share with your friends\n\n- Gallery. Save your images and prompts to a gallery to refer to them later.\n\n- Text-scanning. Found a particularly compelling passage from The Great Gatsby you want to visualize? Scan text to create your prompts. The results can be wild!\n\n- Frequent improvements. The world of generative AI is constantly adapting. Tools like Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion are adding new features at a breakneck pace. We stay on top of the trends so you don't have to. Creator will update as more models and features become available.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.creator-app.com/privacy-policy\nEnd-User License Agreement: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nTerms of Use: https://www.creator-app.com/terms"

      "label": "Imagine ai: AI Art Generator turns imagination to art. Create art and images by telling AI what to do\n\nAI, i.e. artificial intelligence, is trending in today's age, and so is Imagine AI-Create AI Art, an app that can transform your imagination into pictures. Sounds too good to be true? Oh, but it is true. You are not going to believe the realistic magical art, paintings, and images this dynamic app can create until you use it yourself.\n\nSay, for example, you want a pictorial representation of something you have in mind or wrote. You now want an image or painting to depict the same. Drawing it or getting a sketch made is a time-taking task. What do you do? You install this unique AI image generator and turn your imagination or words into art.\n\nHow to use the AI Art app?\nAnyone can become an artist with the AI painter app that makes creating artwork as simple as you can imagine. Whether you want a painting of a starry night or want to represent your dreams in the form of images, it is all possible with this wonder of an app! Steps to use the app:\n1.     Install the Imagine AI app from the play store\n2.     Type the prompt of what you want in the “Type anything” box\n3.     Choose an art style\n4.     Click “create”\n5.     Voila! Your AI painting will be right before you, even before you can wonder what else you want to create on the app\n\nSimple and easy-to-use, the AI image generator is backed by artificial intelligence to transform your written prompts into art. Here’s a little more about the app that will convince you that creating art, visualizing your dreams, and bringing your ideas to life has never been so easy.\n\nFeatures of the AI art generator free app\nYes, the Imagine AI app creates art, but what kind of art? How long does it take to create the art? What will the finished artwork look like? How can you use these AI paintings? Here are all the impressive features of the AI art generator app.\n\nCreate Art from Text Prompts\nNo matter what you’re imagining or what you have in mind, be it a song’s lyrics or just about anything else, type it in the text box on the app. It could be something like “Panda on vacation”  or “a starry night above the mountains” Yes, you can write just about anything in the text box and get art images in just a click!  \n\nChoose from different art styles \nHow do you want the image to look? Like an AI portrait? An AI painting? A sketch? Whether you want it to look as real as in your dreams or you want it to look like a comic cartoon- no matter what art style you want, you can on this AI painter app.\n\nSpeak your visualization\nIf you’re more comfortable explaining what you want than typing it out, use the “mike” next to the text box. You can say something like, “A plane flying over the Himalayas” or “A tiger in the middle of the road.” The text will automatically take the prompt from your voice and convert your visualization into AI art.\n\nReceive Results in Seconds\nCreating an AI image of your imagination or words does not take more than a few seconds on the app. So, you’re investing hardly any time to get what you need.  \n\nGenerate High-quality images\nNo matter what you want to create in the AI painter app, the result will always be of high quality. No grains, no blurs, and no difficulty in identifying anything on the AI art or AI painting.\n\nShare your Creations\nLoved what you created? Share the work directly from the AI image generator app to various other sharing apps.\n\nGenerate Wallpapers\nHave you been looking for something specific to save as your wallpaper but just cannot find what you need? That’s alright. You can now create the wallpaper you want on the app. Type in what you have in mind and let the app work its magic. Save it as your wallpaper, besides just sharing it with others.\n\nInstall  the Imagine AI- Create AI art app now, so you can also bring your imagination to art, and flaunt your creations with others.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

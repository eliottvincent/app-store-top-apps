      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "It’s time to get off the dieting seesaw. With Zero, tap into the power of intermittent fasting and other healthy habits to lose weight and build momentum on your journey toward living longer, better.  \n\nWE’RE #1 FOR A REASON.\n\nZero Members have lost millions of pounds — and that’s no accident. Featured in Good Housekeeping, Men’s Health, Fortune, Techcrunch, Women’s Health, The Tim Ferriss Show, and more, Zero is the world’s most popular fasting app. We help you leverage the science of health in simple ways you can practice daily to build habits that last a lifetime.\n\nRooted in scientific research and supported by Zero’s world-class Scientific Advisory Board — led by Dr. Peter Attia — Zero helps you stack healthy habits to make big changes. You’ll start with one simple habit, like fasting, and build incrementally to improve your exercise, sleep, and more. Get ready to meet a healthier you.\n\nSTART WITH JUST ONE TAP\n\nThe world's most popular Fasting Timer helps you track your fasts, your progress, and your goals. Start your Timer and stay on target with all popular fasting types, including: \n\n• 13-HOUR FAST, based on research by Dr. Satchin Panda (Salk Institute), this 13-hour or “circadian rhythm fast” aligns your eating window with your body’s clock.\n\n• 16-HOUR FAST, or the 16:8 intermittent fast, used by celebrities, athletes, and millions of Zero Members to manage weight and improve metabolic wellbeing.\n\n• 18-HOUR FAST, or 18:6, for more advanced fasters.\n\n• Other popular fasts include OMAD (one meal a day), the 20:4 fast, and custom prolonged fasts up to 7 days.\n\nGET PERSONAL\n\nZero’s real-time tips, individualized stats, and Personalized Fasting Zones have helped millions of Members form new habits and achieve their weight-loss and health-gain goals. Discover insights into the changes your body is experiencing and get guidance and accountability along the way.\n\nGO BEYOND FASTING\n\nFasting is a great starting point for living a longer, healthier life. But if you’re committed to losing weight, gaining health, and boosting longevity, you’ll need to look to the Four Pillars of Health: Nutrition, Activity, Sleep, and Restoration. Zero’s innovative yet simple features help you build lifelong habits across these Four Pillars for accelerated progress and transformative change.\n\nSEE THE FULL PICTURE\n\nThe Loop helps you visualize your journey and celebrate wins across the Four Pillars of Health. As you log or sync your data, you’ll see the corresponding color for each Pillar added to the Loop. Watch as your smart choices add up over days, weeks, months, and years.\n\nBUILD CONSISTENCY\n\nBuild actionable, data-driven habits with the Habit Tracker. Build consistency by logging your meals, workouts, and more. If you’re using an Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura Ring, or other apps and wearables, you can sync them with Zero to make this a completely automated experience.\n\nMAINTAIN MOMENTUM\n\nStay focused with expert-led, science-backed content, community Challenges, achievements, and more. Zero is your partner for building healthy habits that propel you towards better, lasting health.\n\nDownload the Zero app to get started for free, or unlock premium features with Zero Plus.\n\nPayment for Zero Plus will be charged to your iTunes Account when you subscribe.

It's trusted in most religions, but anyone can use its benefits.\n\nUnlike popular new fads, intermittent fasting makes your body work precisely as it was designed by mother nature. It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

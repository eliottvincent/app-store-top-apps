Featuring the latest news, excellent writing and strong opinions on nude-related topics from travel and leisure to art and culture, backed up by some brilliant photography, H&E offers unrivalled coverage of the naturist world, and if you are a newcomer to the lifestyle, the magazine is a great place to start. This is a moderated version of the magazine, and please note the H&E app is entirely separate to our digital edition available via browser.\n\nEvery month H&E naturist is packed with a host of features on practically every aspect of the naturist lifestyle around the world. Every issue carries an updated UK & Ireland club and swim guide and What's On listings, plus regular columns on France, Spain and Portugal, nude-related film and book reviews, and a Q&A column which aims to answer readers' questions about naturism, whether they be common or more unusual inquiries. \n\nThere is also a regular food column with the young Manchester-based Naked Vegan Cooks, who you might have seen on TV in C4's widely trailed My Daughter, the Teenage Nudist. \n\nThroughout the year, special features offer a closer look at a wider range of destinations, from the USA & Caribbean and Greece, to what the UK has to offer with updates from home grown naturist clubs and attractions. \n\nIf you’re interested in the naturist lifestyle, where to meet like-minded people and how to get involved then H&E is essential reading.\n\nNote: This app is a moderated version of H&E Naturist Magazine, as full nudity is not allowed on this platform.\n\nSingle issues are available to purchase at £3.99 and you can take out an annual subscription at £28.99 a year. \n\nSubscription-related details:\n\n-The subscription will include the current issue if you do not already own it, and subsequently-published future issues. \n\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period \n\n- You may turn off auto-renewing subscriptions by going to your user’s Account Settings after purchase.

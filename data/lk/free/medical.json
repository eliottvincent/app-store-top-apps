You can now consult government doctors for free via oDoc from wherever you are.\n\nAs of January 2020, oDoc, Sri Lanka’s largest telemedicine platform, has over 1000 partner GPs and specialists, including many senior consultants across 60+ specialisations. All doctors on oDoc are Sri Lanka Medical Council registered with 5+ years of experience. They are well equipped to manage oDoc consultations and issue prescriptions. This means you have access to high-quality care without the hassle of traffic, waiting rooms and queues.\n\nDoesn't it sound perfect? However, you may wonder how a doctor can correctly diagnose you without seeing you in person? Well, it's very much like any other doctor consultation you’ve had! Understanding your medical history and your symptoms is as important as a physical examination. According to the American Medical Association, 75% of doctor consultations can be diagnosed online, and our doctors are skilled in providing a diagnosis and medical advice online.\n\nAs a policy, we refund you in the event your doctor determines a physical examination is required. In these cases, the doctor will be paid by us. This means you pay only when you receive care, and doctors are always compensated for their professional services.\n\nOn oDoc, you own all your data, and your data is stored securely on HIPAA-compliant servers."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

It is mostly intended for use as part of voice therapy, and users should be aiming to use the tool for about 5 minutes a day over several months.

Everybody needs to continue to act carefully and remain cautious.\n\nDownload the app and keep it up to date to receive the latest guidance.\n\nThe app uses proven privacy software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. You can delete your data, or the app, at any time.\n\nThe NHS COVID-19 app features:\n\nAlerts: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have since tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nLatest information: Find out the latest COVID-19 guidance and know the level of COVID-19 risk in your local area.\n\nSymptoms: Check if you have COVID-19 symptoms and follow the latest guidance.\n\nTest:  Enter any positive test result (NHS or paid-for) to anonymously notify other app users who were near you that they might be at risk. You'll also get the latest health advice.\n \nAvailable in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.\n\nThe app can be used when travelling across England, Wales, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), and alerting them if they have been in contact with someone who later reported a positive test result in the app.\n\nThe app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.\n\nThe app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended)."

      "label": "▸▸▸ Minnies 2020: Nominated FINALIST \"Best Radiology Mobile App\" \n▸▸▸ Winner of the \"Best Radiology Mobile App 2018\" Award at the RSNA 2018 in Chicago!\n-AuntMinnie.com!\n\n\n◆◆◆ THE RADIOLOGY ASSISTANT  2.0 ◆◆◆\n▸ Concise, peer-reviewed articles from expert radiologists\n\nConsistently in the \"Top Medical Apps\" in many countries\n\n\"..excellent information on a large variety of topics\"\n- MedGadget.com\n\n\n\n▸▸ USER REVIEWS\n\n+ \"Finally a great radiology app… well worth the money!\" - [4 stars]\n\n+ \"Easy to navigate and great teaching program\" - [5 stars]\n\n+ \"This is a must-have for those in radiology!\" - [5 stars]\n\n+ \"This app is great and not only for radiology residents but also for other specialties as well as for seasoned clinicians. Great Job!\" - [5 stars]\n\n+ \"Well, I simply love this app! Very useful in radiology practice. Awesome photos and drawings! Can't wait for new updates! Just buy it!!!!\"  - [5 stars]\n\n+ \"Great app, with great content, well worth the few bucks! Support was excellent, my email was answered within a day. Keep it up!\"  - [5 stars]\n\n\n\n▸▸  KEY FEATURES\n\nThe app uses offline content with a layout that is optimized for your device's screen.\n\nWhen new content becomes available it can be directly downloaded to your device: No need to update the whole application from the App Store.\n\nFull text searching of all articles, both across all categories, and per category. Continues your full text search within the article.\n\nHi-res versions of article images, as well as image-stacks, can be viewed fullscreen, without leaving your place in the article; even when offline!\n\n\n▸▸  BACKGROUND\n\nThe Radiology Assistant 1.0 was released almost 7 years ago. It quickly became one of the most downloaded radiology apps, and consistently stayed in the Top Medical Apps section in numerous countries for all those years.\n\nWe have spent over a year completely rewriting the app, from the ground up. Radiology Assistant 2.0 provides a cleaner, faster and more efficient reading experience for all modern iOS devices. \n\nFor the technically interested: formerly Objective-C, the app is now 100% Swift\n\nBefore winning the \"Best Radiology Mobile App\" Award in 2018, the \"Radiology Assistant\" was a Minnies 2013 Finalist - Best Radiology Mobile App, nominated together with OsiriX HD! And again in 2017!\n- AuntMinnie.com\n\n\n\n▸▸  PRICING\n\nInstead of paying up front as for the Radiology Assistant 1.0, this new 2.0 app is a free download, and you can take a subscription to those Article Categories that you need. If you purchase all Categories you pay the same as RA1.0. If you need less Categories, you pay less.\n\n\n\n▸▸  ABOUT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION\n\n+ All subscription options are for the duration of one year and can be cancelled at any time.\n+ Each subscription option gives you unlimited access to all Articles in one or more Categories.\n+ When you select a subscription option you can still cancel the purchase. If you confirm, the payment will be charged to your iTunes Account, just like any other App Store purchase.\n+ Your subscription automatically renews. If this is not what you want, simply turn off auto-renew. You can do this at any time - but at least 24-hours before the end of the current period - by tapping the ‘Manage Subscription’ inside the app, or via your iTunes Account Settings. If you do not cancel, your iTunes Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.\n+ If you are a Radiology Assistant 1.0 user, cancelling your subscription will forfeit any unused portion of the offered free period.\n+ You can upgrade to an option giving access to more or all Categories at any time. If you upgrade before your current subscription is over, you will be refunded the unused portion of your current subscription.\n+ You can find our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy on the in-app About page, as well as on our website, at https://doRadiology.com/RA2Legal.pdf."

Hearing people can use this app to transcribe meetings or notes. Deaf people can see live transcriptions/captions of what people are saying, and type words to respond.\n\nLive Transcription\n• Continuous transcription in 60+ languages.\n• Offline support for some languages.\n• Change the font size, including Extra Large.\n• Flip the text.\n• Choose among the three microphones on your device that is closest to the speaker. You can also use bluetooth headphones (e.g. AirPods) or wired headphones (e.g. EarPods) to get even closer to the speaker.\n• Custom-designed algorithm that amplifies voices, making it possible to transcribe speech from farther away.\n• [NEW] Picture-in-picture floating window support so that you can see the transcription even when you’re using another app. (iOS 15+ required)\n• Transcribe audio played by other apps, including podcasts and videos. (Best with front/bottom microphones)\n• Option to start the transcription on app launch, or continue the transcription on app close.\n• Gentle haptics let you know when words are said even when you’re not looking at the screen.\n• Share and copy the transcription.\n• Option to filter profanity.\n\nRespond With Typing\n• Type your response and have your text shown full screen in large type (upside down if you like).\n• Have the device say the words out loud for you as you type them.\n• Customize the speed of the voices.\n• Select the gender of the voices (available in some languages).\n\nCommon Phrases For Quick Access\n• Add common phrases so that you can display it with a single tap, without the need for typing.\n• Pre-configured with useful phrases that explains how to use the app to others.\n\nPrivacy\n• Zero personal information is collected, unless if you send us an email (in which case we’ll get your email address and some other info, only for providing support). \n• We just don’t want to know or care about what you are transcribing.\n• Recognition can happen entirely on-device if you like.\n• No ads, or their creepy frameworks.\n• No analytics, unless you choose to “Share With Developers” during your iOS set-up.\n• A privacy policy that humans can actually understand.\n• The competition does not even come close.\n\nMade With Love\n• We read every feedback email and App Store review carefully, and respond promptly.\n• Tested and loved by many users in the deaf community.\n• Super polished user experience designed for simplicity and efficiency.\n• Support for Dynamic Type, which adapts the font size to the system setting.\n• An honest business model. No “free trials” that automatically renew into expensive subscriptions.\n• Includes an Easter egg (hint: reptile).\n\nPrivacy policy & terms of service: https://deepfriedpotato.github.io/minispeech/termsandprivacy"

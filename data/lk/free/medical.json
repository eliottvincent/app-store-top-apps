All doctors on oDoc are Sri Lanka Medical Council registered with 5+ years of experience. They are well equipped to manage oDoc consultations and issue prescriptions. This means you have access to high-quality care without the hassle of traffic, waiting rooms and queues.\n\nDoesn't it sound perfect? However, you may wonder how a doctor can correctly diagnose you without seeing you in person? Well, it's very much like any other doctor consultation you’ve had! Understanding your medical history and your symptoms is as important as a physical examination. According to the American Medical Association, 75% of doctor consultations can be diagnosed online, and our doctors are skilled in providing a diagnosis and medical advice online.\n\nAs a policy, we refund you in the event your doctor determines a physical examination is required. In these cases, the doctor will be paid by us. This means you pay only when you receive care, and doctors are always compensated for their professional services.\n\nOn oDoc, you own all your data, and your data is stored securely on HIPAA-compliant servers."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "YOU are the reason for the MaNaDr app. This app is your link to your trusted doctor. You can book appointments and chat with YOUR doctor, rather than a random doctor that you are unsure of. You will be able to book appointments for your family and friends with your trusted doctor. You will be able to schedule home care visits with your doctor and his/her trusted providers. Soon you will also be able to buy products that your doctor has curated and screened for you. The key is trust.\n\nAppointment bookings are secure and in real time. Your trusted doctor’s available time slots can be viewed from the app and you can choose the date, time and location to suit your convenience. Booking can be done 24/7 anytime, anywhere. You will receive reminders of your upcoming appointments and can view previous appointments. Reschedule or cancel your appointments through the app (within specified time limits). \n\nChat with your trusted doctor. Maybe you have a quick question that doesn’t need a trip down to the doctor. Your trusted doctor knows you and your medical history. He or she will be the best person to give you advice. With MaNaDr, you can quickly open a chat or a video consult with your trusted doctor. At the end of the chat, get a summary report from your doctor.\n\nNeed a home visit? Not just a doctor’s visit, but perhaps for nursing care, physiotherapy or other home care services? Look for your trusted doctor’s home care provider and book an appointment directly.\n\nChildren and the elderly without mobile devices are not left out. Add them as your family or friends and book appointments on their behalf.\n\nMaNaDr aims to be the one app for you and your family’s healthcare needs, from infancy to the golden years. For now, we connect you to your trusted healthcare provider but there will be much more to come. Stay tuned!\n\nYour healthcare data is secure. All communication between the mobile apps and our servers are secured by 256 bit SSL. \n\nThis app is currently applicable only in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia.\n\nBooking fees and consultation charges may apply."

With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\n\n\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals. It is a tool that anyone working in the medical industry should possess.\"\n\n\"Great app for keeping your skills sharp and seeing a wide variety of cases\"\n\nECG Pro provides: \n\n1) 3500+ abnormal real world 12 lead ECG cases in raw data (In-App-Purchase needed for advanced ones)\n2) Each case has professional interpretation and measurement \n3) They cover 100+ common ECG findings \n\n[Features] \n1) Browse ECG cases by findings like \"Atrial Flutter\", \"Escape Rhythm\" and more \n2) Search for whatever you want to learn, like \"Flat T wave\" \n3) Dynamically play each case in monitoring mode (with beeping sound) \n4) Display leads in 12 x 1, 6 x 2, 4 x 3 layout \n5) Each case has 12 template views with P / QRS / T waves identified \n6) Send cases to your friends, in PDF format \n\nFor students or interns, you can use the cases as learning resources. \nFor teachers, you can use the cases as teaching resources. \n\n[Note] \n1) All cases are stored in raw data (sample rate is 500hz), not static images, so you can look into very detailed waves in pixels \n2) You should already have basic knowledge of ECG interpretation, and you use the cases to build a solid cardiology foundation \n\n[Findings Covered] \nAtrial Flutter \nAtrial Fibrillation \nVentricular Fibrillation \nEscape Beat \nPAC (Premature Atrial Contruction) \nPAC Bigeminy \nPAC Trigeminy \nPVC (Premature Ventricular Contruction) \nPVC Bigeminy \nPVC Trigeminy \nSupraventricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Escape Rhythm \nVentricular Rhythm \nQT Prolongation \nShort QT \nHigh T \nST Elevation \nS1,S2,S3 Pattern \nHigh Voltage \nPositive T in V1 \nVentricular Hypertrophy \n\nand more..."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Measure your stress to manage it!\n\n- What is the principle behind StressScan? − \nMany of the functions essential to maintaining human health are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is medically recognized that the balance of the autonomic nervous system can become disordered through fatigue and other stress, stemming from causes such as work and human relationships. By analyzing the waveform of your heartbeat as measured at the fingertip, StressScan can analyze the balance of your autonomic nervous system and measure your stress level on a stress index of 1 to 100.\n\n- You can trust StressScan! - \nThe technology used by StressScan is based on heart rate variability analysis, which is widely recognized in the field of heart rate analysis and autonomic nervous system research. \nAlthough heart rate variability analysis technology is not yet generally well known, many medical institutions and companies have taken an interest and are beginning to put it to use. The technology is seeing use even at the cutting edge of stress care, including adoption by the US military to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers returning from the battlefield, and by NASA for astronaut training and health management.\n\n- Usable in a range of scenarios! - \n· Periodic checking of daily stress level\n· Checking the effects of favorite meals and drinks on stress\n· Checking relaxation while traveling or at a favorite spot\n\n- Device compatibility -\nThe app is intended for use with a camera- and flash-equipped smartphone. It is not usable with devices that do not have a camera and flash.\n\n- Usage environment -\nAn Internet connection is required to use the app. External support for measurement functions is used for complex stress analysis."

The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

      "label": "EuroSCORE stands for European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation.  It identifies a number of risk factors which help to predict mortality from cardiac surgery.  The original EuroSCORE calculator was published in 1999, derived from an international database of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The EuroSCORE II calculator was released for use on October 3, 2011 at the European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery meeting in Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe original calculator is used worldwide for both the measurement of risk and as a benchmark for the assessment of quality of cardiac surgical services.  There are more than 1300 formal citations of the EuroSCORE in the medical literature.\r\n\r\nThe previous additive and logistic EuroSCORE versions are now inappropriately calibrated but have remained powerfully discriminatory.  Nevertheless, there is evidence that discrimination may be improved further by refining and modifying some of the risk factors, such as renal dysfunction.  Therefore, the new EuroSCORE II calculator was developed to optimize its useful application in contemporary practice.\r\n\r\nThe EuroSCORE II calculator is to be used as an educational tool only, and it should not be viewed as a substitute for the opinion of expert Cardiac Surgeons and Cardiologists.  Clinical judgement must be used whenever rare risk factors are present.  The risk model provides a set standard, and units and surgeons will perform at, above or below the standard.  Best practice in quoting risk to patients is to adjust the risk calculated by EuroSCORE II to the results achieved by the unit in question.  The application is meant to be used as a tool to guide discussions with patients, families, and healthcare providers regarding the potential outcomes after open heart surgery."

      "label": "Warfarin Guide offers three resources essential for systematic and careful evidence-based anticoagulation with Warfarin.  First it reviews recommendations on indications, INR targets, and treatment duration from the American College of Chest Physicians 8th Edition guidelines on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy from 2008, updated for the 2012 guideline.  Second it offers a protocol for Warfarin dose adjustment depending upon INR result.  And third is a discussion of protocols for the initiation of Warfarin.  These resources come from point of care guides on these topics in the family medicine literature as well as the 2012 ACCP guideline.  The app also offers guidance for management of peri-operative Warfarin by directing the user to oexcellent comprehensive resources for managing all anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents around surgery.\n\nThe app addresses such common questions as: \n\n•which artificial heart valves require that higher level of anticoagulation? \n•how do I respond to an INR of 7.4? \n•this pt needs Warfarin, how do I get it started? \n•I'm adjusting the total weekly warfarin dose down by 5%, when should I recheck the INR? \n•when do I give Vitamin K to reverse Warfarin anticoagulation and at what dose??\n\nThis app is written and intended for practicing clinicians involved in Warfarin anticoagulation such as internists, cardiologists, family physicians, nurses, pharmacists, PA's and NP's; for resident physician trainees; and for medical students.  As an educator and clinician, I am interested in feedback and I would be grateful for guidance on improving the tool."

Contractions are mild, similar to menstrual cramps and irregular. Each contraction lasts 30 to 45 seconds and occurs five to 20 minutes apart.\n\nActive labor:\nThe cervix will dilate from 4 cm to 7 cm and contractions will be stronger and last longer. Usually, they will last 45 to 60 seconds, with 3 minutes to 5 minutes between each one. This is the point where you should go to the hospital.\n\nTransition:\nDuring this final phase of labor before the birth of your baby, the cervix opens completely from 8 cm to 10 cm. Contractions can be so long and intense that they may seem to overlap. Each one will last about 60 to 90 seconds with just 30 seconds to 2 minutes rest between each.\n\nImportant:\nIf your water broke, you must go to the hospital right away, regardless of the frequency of contractions!\n\nDuring pregnancy and before childbirth, always stay in touch with your doctor.\n\nHow to use the Kick Counter?\n\nLie down on your side or relax in a comfortable chair\n\nPay attention only to your baby's movements\n\nPress \"KICK\" button on any movement that you can feel (except hiccups)\n\nThe baby does not need to move 10 times EVERY two hours, but they should have a couple of active hours each day.\n\nImportant:\nIf your baby kicks less than 10 times per 2 hours you should call a doctor \n\nEasy delivery for you and your child!"

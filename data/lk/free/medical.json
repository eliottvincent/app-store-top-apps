You can now consult government doctors for free via oDoc from wherever you are.\n\nAs of January 2020, oDoc, Sri Lanka’s largest telemedicine platform, has over 1000 partner GPs and specialists, including many senior consultants across 60+ specialisations. All doctors on oDoc are Sri Lanka Medical Council registered with 5+ years of experience. They are well equipped to manage oDoc consultations and issue prescriptions. This means you have access to high-quality care without the hassle of traffic, waiting rooms and queues.\n\nDoesn't it sound perfect? However, you may wonder how a doctor can correctly diagnose you without seeing you in person? Well, it's very much like any other doctor consultation you’ve had! Understanding your medical history and your symptoms is as important as a physical examination. According to the American Medical Association, 75% of doctor consultations can be diagnosed online, and our doctors are skilled in providing a diagnosis and medical advice online.\n\nAs a policy, we refund you in the event your doctor determines a physical examination is required. In these cases, the doctor will be paid by us. This means you pay only when you receive care, and doctors are always compensated for their professional services.\n\nOn oDoc, you own all your data, and your data is stored securely on HIPAA-compliant servers."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students.

The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

      "label": "Does the world need another OB-wheel-due-date-calculator app?  You bet!  OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

But when skin is cut, scratched, or punctured, germs can enter the wound and cause infections, which can lead to other health problems.\n\nMedical Information Disclaimer\n\nOur App contains general medical information.\nThe medical information is not advice and should not be treated as such.\nThe medical information on our App is provided without any representations or warranties, express or implied.\nYou must not rely on the information on our App as an alternative to medical advice from your doctor or other professional healthcare provider.\nIf you have any specific questions about any medical matter, you should consult your doctor or other professional healthcare provider.\nIf you think you may be suffering from any medical condition, you should seek immediate medical attention.\nYou should never delay seeking medical advice, disregard medical advice or discontinue medical treatment because of information on our App.\nOur App includes interactive features that allow users to communicate with us.\nYou acknowledge that, because of the limited nature of communication through our App’s interactive features, any assistance you may receive using any such features is likely to be incomplete and may even be misleading.\nAny assistance you may receive using any our App’s interactive features does not constitute specific advice and accordingly should not be relied upon without further independent confirmation."

      "label": "“We designed this ECG App with the goal of making electrocardiogram reading as easy as possible. With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\n\n\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals. It is a tool that anyone working in the medical industry should possess.\"\n\n\"Great app for keeping your skills sharp and seeing a wide variety of cases\"\n\nECG Pro provides: \n\n1) 3500+ abnormal real world 12 lead ECG cases in raw data (In-App-Purchase needed for advanced ones)\n2) Each case has professional interpretation and measurement \n3) They cover 100+ common ECG findings \n\n[Features] \n1) Browse ECG cases by findings like \"Atrial Flutter\", \"Escape Rhythm\" and more \n2) Search for whatever you want to learn, like \"Flat T wave\" \n3) Dynamically play each case in monitoring mode (with beeping sound) \n4) Display leads in 12 x 1, 6 x 2, 4 x 3 layout \n5) Each case has 12 template views with P / QRS / T waves identified \n6) Send cases to your friends, in PDF format \n\nFor students or interns, you can use the cases as learning resources. \nFor teachers, you can use the cases as teaching resources. \n\n[Note] \n1) All cases are stored in raw data (sample rate is 500hz), not static images, so you can look into very detailed waves in pixels \n2) You should already have basic knowledge of ECG interpretation, and you use the cases to build a solid cardiology foundation \n\n[Findings Covered] \nAtrial Flutter \nAtrial Fibrillation \nVentricular Fibrillation \nEscape Beat \nPAC (Premature Atrial Contruction) \nPAC Bigeminy \nPAC Trigeminy \nPVC (Premature Ventricular Contruction) \nPVC Bigeminy \nPVC Trigeminy \nSupraventricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Tachycardia \nVentricular Escape Rhythm \nVentricular Rhythm \nQT Prolongation \nShort QT \nHigh T \nST Elevation \nS1,S2,S3 Pattern \nHigh Voltage \nPositive T in V1 \nVentricular Hypertrophy \n\nand more..."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "It has become clear that the current pharmacological nomenclature of psychotropic medications does not reflect our contemporary knowledge, nor does it inform properly the clinician of neuroscience-based prescriptions. Very often we prescribe “antidepressants” for “anxiety” disorders or “second-generation antipsychotics” to depressed patients.\nThis practice is confusing.\n• Five international organizations ECNP, ACNP, AsCNP, CINP & IUPHAR  decided five years ago to establish a taskforce and gave it the mission to embed our current neuroscience advances in the nomenclature.\n• The scope is to include all the medications with CNS indications and to harness this new nomenclature to help clinicians when they are trying to figure out what would be the next rational “neuropsychopharmacological step”.\n• In this second edition 22 new medications were added so NbN includes now 130 medications.  \nThis proposed nomenclature aims to reflect the current pharmacological knowledge base and cannot necessarily represent the ultimate scientific truth.\nThe taskforce that assembled  could have taken the stand that our current knowledge base is not enough to define the primary target or the correct mechanisms of action. But as a taskforce, we feel that it’s better to present a cutting-edge scientific interpretation than to wait for the definitive conclusion. We need to treat our patients now, and we cannot postpone treatment until all the facts are known.\n \nTherefore this nomenclature is based on:\n1. The need to treat now.\n2. Updated neuroscience insights.\n3. The judgment of the members of the taskforce.\nAlong these lines, we have come up with the following proposal:\nThe Nomenclature:\nPharmacology and Mode of Action – reflects the current knowledge and understanding about the targeted neurotransmitter/ molecule/system being modified and the mode/mechanism of action.\n We also added 4 additional dimensions\n4 Additional Dimensions:\nApproved Indications – based on the recommendations of major regulatory bodies (e.g. FDA, EMA, etc.)\nEfficacy and Side Effects – Driven from positive single, large, RCT and/or “heavy solid weight” clinical data. Only prevalent or life-threatening side effects were included \nPractical Note – Summarizes the clinical knowledge that has been \"filtered\" through the taskforce's \"sieve\"\nNeurobiology – This dimension is focused on the biology. It is divided into preclinical and clinical sections, with the emphasis on the latter\nFor those who would like to know more abo derived from empirical data.ut the pharmacology, there is a direct link to the relevant site of IUPHAR – our collaborator in this endeavour.\n \nAs this is on-going process, we recognize that the product is imperfect. Based on your feedback (and taking into account the feedback of other colleges) new reports and findings, appropriate updates (e.g. later editions) will be undertaken."

It will work without an external microphone but please be-aware that results may vary as the voice pitch analysis requires a relatively quiet environment and some phone microphones can pickup a lot of background noise.  \n\nThis tool is designed to act as a voice recorder/playback/analyser tool but with useful information such as voice pitch, tones, & volume with resonance and phonetics to be added at a later date. It is mostly intended for use as part of voice therapy, and users should be aiming to use the tool for about 5 minutes a day over several months.  It does not provide lessons or guidance, it is intended to be used as a tool to assist with voice therapy and not as a replacement for voice therapy.\n\n=Privacy=\nNo voice recordings are saved or leave the device.\n\n=Free=\nThis app is available in two flavors; a free advert supported version, and a paid advert-free version.  You can remove the adverts via an in-app purchase in the settings screen.\n\n=Bugs=\nHelp us to improve this app, if it doesn't work, or you have any ideas to help us improve please drop us an email so that we can improve things in the next release!"

And there is no more reliable resource for trauma information than the American College of Surgeons (ACS).  This app was developed alongside their seminal course, Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS). ATLS has trained more than 1.5 million participants in more than 75,000 courses around the world.    \n\nATLS provides the essential information and skills for doctors, nurses, and other health professionals to identify and treat life-threatening injuries under the extreme pressures of the trauma environment. The international nature of the program means that the content is adaptable to a variety of geographic, economic, social, and medical practice situations.\n\nWhether in a hospital trauma bay, on the highway at a motor vehicle crash, in a disaster area after a bombing, or in a foreign country’s war zone, clinicians need ready access to critical resources and references.   The content and skills presented in this app will add to the armamentarium of doctors and other clinicians who treat trauma patients.  \n\nThe app includes a free preview of the 1st chapter.\n\nAdditional content can be purchased to instantly gain full access to the following:\n• Interactive visuals, such as treatment algorithms and x-ray identification \n• Just in Time video segments capturing key skills in minutes \n• Calculators, such as pediatric burn calculator and the Parkland Formula to determine fluid administration\n• Animations, such as airway management and surgical cricothyroidotomy\n\nFor those who have purchased the 9th edition of the ATLS Student Course Manual, simply enter the book code that was packaged in the book to gain free access to all the content."

This easy-to-use and convenient format will further assist health care professionals in their implementation of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®), thus improving the quality and effectiveness of care provided to patients with cancer. \n\nNCCN is a not-for-profit alliance of leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education. NCCN is dedicated to improving and facilitating quality, effective, efficient, and accessible cancer care so patients can live better lives. Through the leadership and expertise of clinical professionals at NCCN Member Institutions, NCCN develops resources that present valuable information to the numerous stakeholders in the health care delivery system. By defining and advancing high-quality cancer care, NCCN promotes the importance of continuous quality improvement and recognizes the significance of creating clinical practice guidelines appropriate for use by patients, clinicians, and other health care decision-makers around the world.\n\nOver the past 25 years, NCCN has developed an integrated suite of tools to improve the quality of cancer care. The NCCN Guidelines® document evidence-based, consensus-driven management to ensure that all patients receive preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and supportive services that are most likely to lead to optimal outcomes. \n\nThe NCCN Guidelines are a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and interventions that apply to 97 percent of cancer cases in the United States. In addition, separate guidelines relate to major prevention and screening topics and another set of pathways focuses on the major supportive care areas. \n\nThe NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations based on the best evidence available at the time they are derived. Because new data are published continuously, it is essential that the NCCN Guidelines also be continuously updated and revised to reflect new data and new clinical information. The intent of the NCCN Guidelines is to assist in the decision-making process of individuals involved in cancer care—including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, payers, patients and their families—with the ultimate goal of improving patient care and outcomes. The NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations for appropriate care for most but not all patients; however, individual patient circumstances must be considered when applying these recommendations. \n\nVisit NCCN.org to learn more about the NCCN Guidelines as well as other NCCN Content."

It calculates BED for a given alpha/beta ratio as a function of the dose per fraction and number of fractions for EBRT, and initial dose rate for brachytherapy. For a predetermined BED, the app solves the quadratic equation to calculate  dose per fraction as a function of the number of fractions desired.

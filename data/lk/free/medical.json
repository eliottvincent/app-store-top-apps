You can now consult government doctors for free via oDoc from wherever you are.\n\nAs of January 2020, oDoc, Sri Lanka’s largest telemedicine platform, has over 1000 partner GPs and specialists, including many senior consultants across 60+ specialisations. All doctors on oDoc are Sri Lanka Medical Council registered with 5+ years of experience. They are well equipped to manage oDoc consultations and issue prescriptions. This means you have access to high-quality care without the hassle of traffic, waiting rooms and queues.\n\nDoesn't it sound perfect? However, you may wonder how a doctor can correctly diagnose you without seeing you in person? Well, it's very much like any other doctor consultation you’ve had! Understanding your medical history and your symptoms is as important as a physical examination. According to the American Medical Association, 75% of doctor consultations can be diagnosed online, and our doctors are skilled in providing a diagnosis and medical advice online.\n\nAs a policy, we refund you in the event your doctor determines a physical examination is required. In these cases, the doctor will be paid by us. This means you pay only when you receive care, and doctors are always compensated for their professional services.\n\nOn oDoc, you own all your data, and your data is stored securely on HIPAA-compliant servers."

Clinical Pharmacology is the most current and comprehensive drug reference compendium available.\n\nFAST, ACCURATE & RELIABLE\nClinical Pharmacology Mobile offers the fastest path to accurate answers and provides convenient access to the features and functionality that clinicians rely on most from Clinical Pharmacology, even when you are offline!\n\nSMART SEARCH\nPowerful multi-concept search by drug name, indication, contraindication or adverse reaction to quickly find the precise drug information you need. Robust tools to assist your search, such as predictive type-ahead, search history, and scoped search by drug classification, product or monograph.\n\nEASILY DIGESTIBLE INFORMATION & ACTIONABLE DATA\nThe same authoritative content, but more concise and presented in the form of an answer funnel – tap thru to only the level of detail you require. Toggle multiple views within the same interface to find the right clinical lens - Adult versus Pediatric dosing, On versus Off Label use by indication, and more. Strategic use of info-graphics instead of text to provide answers at a glance. \n\nDRUG IDENTIFIER\nEasily identify pills using the imprint or by physical characteristics such as shape, color, scoring or dosage form. Dynamic imprint matches save you time, with type-ahead surfacing the drug name and thumbnail for immediate verification. Results feature multiple ways to aid visual identification, including full-screen, high-resolution drug images.\n\nPOWERFUL CLINICAL TOOLS \nEvidence-supported clinical algorithms to quickly identify drug interactions or adverse reactions:\n• Drug-to-drug interaction report: immediate feedback on interactions as you enter drugs, leading to an easy-to-scan synoptic description of interactions categorized by severity. Unique to Clinical Pharmacology, optionally check for interactions between drugs and other life-style factors such as diet, smoking, alcohol consumption and more. Tap through the synopsis to see a detailed description of the interaction, which can be toggled between a professional and consumer view to share and consult with patients. \n• Adverse reaction report (ADR): using the only algorithm of its kind on the market, enter either a single drug or a combination of drugs and see the adverse reactions they cause. Easily filter and sort the report by key clinical factors such as severity, incidence and onset.\n\nFEWER TAPS, QUICKER ANSWERS \nBuilt by clinicians for clinicians, speed to answer was the operating principle that guided every decision around the app’s navigation, flow and content structure. Each major feature is one-tap away, and all extraneous steps have been removed or optimized to complement a clinician’s busy workflow. \n\nQUESTIONS/FEEDBACK\nAdditional questions or problems accessing the application?

This easy-to-use and convenient format will further assist health care professionals in their implementation of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®), thus improving the quality and effectiveness of care provided to patients with cancer. \n\nNCCN is a not-for-profit alliance of leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education. NCCN is dedicated to improving and facilitating quality, effective, efficient, and accessible cancer care so patients can live better lives. Through the leadership and expertise of clinical professionals at NCCN Member Institutions, NCCN develops resources that present valuable information to the numerous stakeholders in the health care delivery system. By defining and advancing high-quality cancer care, NCCN promotes the importance of continuous quality improvement and recognizes the significance of creating clinical practice guidelines appropriate for use by patients, clinicians, and other health care decision-makers around the world.\n\nOver the past 25 years, NCCN has developed an integrated suite of tools to improve the quality of cancer care. The NCCN Guidelines® document evidence-based, consensus-driven management to ensure that all patients receive preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and supportive services that are most likely to lead to optimal outcomes. \n\nThe NCCN Guidelines are a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and interventions that apply to 97 percent of cancer cases in the United States. In addition, separate guidelines relate to major prevention and screening topics and another set of pathways focuses on the major supportive care areas. \n\nThe NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations based on the best evidence available at the time they are derived. Because new data are published continuously, it is essential that the NCCN Guidelines also be continuously updated and revised to reflect new data and new clinical information. The intent of the NCCN Guidelines is to assist in the decision-making process of individuals involved in cancer care—including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, payers, patients and their families—with the ultimate goal of improving patient care and outcomes. The NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations for appropriate care for most but not all patients; however, individual patient circumstances must be considered when applying these recommendations. \n\nVisit NCCN.org to learn more about the NCCN Guidelines as well as other NCCN Content."

      "label": "Help when you need it, for those with seizure disorders. \n\nSeizAlarm is a user-friendly iPhone and Apple Watch app that allows those with epilepsy and other seizure disorders to alert emergency contacts when they need help*.  \n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Seizure detection.  Seizure-like detection is done via the motion sensors on the iPhone and/or motion sensors or heart rate sensor on the Apple Watch.  Sensitivity controls allow you to set customized settings specific to you.  When a potential seizure is detected, emergency contacts will automatically be contacted via multiple channels (text message, phone call, and email). \n\n- Send immediate help requests manually to emergency contacts. \n\n- Also available is a manually activated time delayed help request feature (via the \"Time Delayed Help\" button) that is helpful for those that have localized seizures (auras) that may turn into generalized tonic-clonic seizures. You are able to custom set the delay time in the settings.  When a seizure warning is initiated you will see a countdown which can be extended via the press of a button.  If you end up becoming unresponsive due to a seizure then once the timer ends then a help request will be sent.\n\n- When a help request is sent your contacts will be contacted with GPS coordinates (if available), so they know exactly where you are.  \n\n- You can are also able to track your seizure events with robust logging features. A log dashboard gives you a high-level view of past events.  You can also export reports to provide to your doctor. \n\n- SeizAlarm also supports multiple emergency contact support, so more than one person can be contacted when you need help. \n\n- Optional audible siren and/or custom voice message that plays if a help request is sent.\n\n- International phone number support for emergency contact(s).\n\n- Now supporting \"Family Setup\" watches! \n\nHelp is just a button press away. Start taking back your independence today.\n\nPlease give us feedback on how the seizure detection is working for you.  The more feedback we receive will provide us with the information we need to improve detection and reduce false alarms in future versions.\n\nIf you have any questions or have feedback, please contact us at: contact@seizalarm.com.  We want to make SeizAlarm the best that it can be, so feedback from our users is very important to us.\n\nNOTES:\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n- Recommended placement of the iPhone for seizure detection is on the arm using an arm band.\n- Long use of Watch based seizure-like motion and elevated heart rate detection may dramatically decrease watch battery life.\n\n\n*New accounts receive a 2 week trial of the \"Alerts\" service which allows the user to manually or automatically (via seizure-like motion detection) request help from emergency contacts.  Once the trial ends, the user must subscribe to the \"Alerts\" service to continue to have the ability to request help.  The \"Alerts\" service is an auto-renewing cost of $14.99/month or $149.99/year.  \n\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n\n* The payment will be charged to the user's iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.  The account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.  \n\n* Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.  \n\n* No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period.  Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.  The robust seizure log features require no subscription.\n\nPrivacy policy: http://www.seizalarm.com/seizalarm_app-privacy-policy.pdf\nEnd User License Agreement: http://www.seizalarm.com/seizalarm_EULA.pdf"

This will prevent you from getting bitten by mosquitos and other insects. The pitch of the sound is so high that most humans will not hear anything.\n\nOnly female mosquitoes bite humans and animals. They are attracted by light, body odor, lactic acid, carbon dioxide and heat.\n\nTurn on the application and keep it close to you it will produce high frequency sound and mosquitos will avert you. It is not 100% guaranteed but will repel most of mosquitos biting you. Its not foolproof because there are about 3500 admitted mosquito species in the world and they all react marginally different to the repeller.\n\nUse the frequency controls to find the excellent frequency for your place and enjoy outdoors without pesky bugs like mosquitos to annoy you!"

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

Since 2005, MDCalc has been the leading medical reference for the most relevant, up-to-date and widely-used clinical calculators that support evidence-based patient care. Registration is free and takes less than 30 seconds for full, unlimited access.\n\nMDCalc clinical decision support is created exclusively by board-certified physicians for use by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and medical students. The simple yet sleek app provides access to 550+ easy-to-use clinical decision tools including risk scores, algorithms, equations, formulas, classifications, dosing calculators, and more.\n\nWith a new enhancement, clinicians can now earn AMA PRA Category 1TM CME credits by simply reading the clinical content for 150+ calculators. The app will keep track of the CME credits earned in a personal dashboard, where users can also redeem credits for certificates and access their receipts for easy documentation. In order to redeem CME credits, users will need to sign up for a paid CME plan.\n\nUnique features, ideal for the busy practicing clinician:\n\n• Works offline and in limited connection settings. (CME tracking requires a connection.)\n• Fast and easy search and filter to discover new calculators.\n• Customizable lists for quick access: favorites, recently used, your specialty.\n• Auto-syncing between the website and app.\n• Quick toggle between US and SI units.\n• Error warnings and normal values to help avoid mistakes and improper inputs.\n\nOur exclusive “MDCalc Method” for selecting tools - including in-depth appraisal and validation of evidence AND clinical relevance - results in only the highest-quality tools to help you make better decisions and be more efficient in your workflow. And our network of academic and practicing physician experts create easy-to-digest content to reinforce decision making and support training:\n\n• Insights and advice from the EBM creators (e.g. Dr. Phil Wells’ on the Wells’ Criteria).\n• Expert content by specialists on use cases, pearls & pitfalls, results interpretation and more.\n• Synopses of the evidence from the original and validation research.\n\nFrom iMedicalApps in 2016: “The evidence based medicine (EBM) components of the medical app are what really set MDCalc apart from its peers... The MDCalc app gives brief summaries of the critical studies concerning the medical calculator, links to the studies on PubMed as well as “pearls/pitfalls”, “next steps” and expert commentary from the authors of the calculators.” - iMedicalApps “MDCalc app, the best online medical calculator is now an app”\n\nMDCalc clinical decision tools support 35+ specialties including cardiology, critical care/ICU, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, hepatology, infectious disease, internal medicine, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, primary care, psychiatry, pulmonology, surgery, urology, and more! Here are some examples of the tools:\n\n* Calculators that include CME content\n\n» Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)\n» CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia\n» MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)\n» HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk\n» CHADS2 Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk\n» HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events *\n» SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock Criteria *\n» Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)\n» Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) *\n» Wells’ Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism *\n» Wells’ Criteria for DVT"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

It will work without an external microphone but please be-aware that results may vary as the voice pitch analysis requires a relatively quiet environment and some phone microphones can pickup a lot of background noise.  \n\nThis tool is designed to act as a voice recorder/playback/analyser tool but with useful information such as voice pitch, tones, & volume with resonance and phonetics to be added at a later date. It is mostly intended for use as part of voice therapy, and users should be aiming to use the tool for about 5 minutes a day over several months.  It does not provide lessons or guidance, it is intended to be used as a tool to assist with voice therapy and not as a replacement for voice therapy.\n\n=Privacy=\nNo voice recordings are saved or leave the device.\n\n=Free=\nThis app is available in two flavors; a free advert supported version, and a paid advert-free version.  You can remove the adverts via an in-app purchase in the settings screen.\n\n=Bugs=\nHelp us to improve this app, if it doesn't work, or you have any ideas to help us improve please drop us an email so that we can improve things in the next release!"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

Data can be collected automatically from fitness and medical devices or entered manually via the app’s Smart Entry. \n\nThe MedM Health application does not require registration but offers optional synchronization and backup with our free cloud service. Unregistered users can keep their health diaries in offline mode (data stored on the smartphone). \n\nThe MedM Health journal offers its users: \n\n* Easy entry: the app can be set to receive data from devices automatically (the settings screen appears at pairing); alternatively, it takes just a couple of taps to add a journal entry manually. \n\n* Reminders: customizable reminders can be set for various repeat intervals and help ensure that measurements and/or pills are taken on time. \n\n \n\n* Thresholds: notifications (push or email) can be sent if measurements for selected vital signs surpass a set value. \n\n* Remote access and data sharing: the MedM Cloud users can export and backup data to and print out reports from the MedM Health portal (https://health.medm.com). It is also possible to share health data with loved ones, friends, and physicians. The cloud keeps the health journal safely stored and up-to-date, even if medical or fitness devices change. \n\n\n\n* Uncluttered interface: the app’s clean and minimalistic design with no ads or in-app purchases helps users focus on tracking their data. \n \n* Data safety: MedM complies with all applicable data protection best practices: measurements are securely synchronized with MedM Cloud via HTTPS protocol, and data is stored encrypted on securely hosted servers. Users exercise full control of their records and can export or request to delete them at any time. \n\n \n\n* Export to/import from Apple Health: activity information (daily steps and sleep), heart rate, weight, blood pressure, blood oxygen, blood glucose, spirometry, and body temperature data. \n\n\nMedM is the absolute world leader in Smart Medical devices connectivity. Our apps provide seamless direct data collection from hundreds of fitness and medical devices, sensors, and wearables equipped with Bluetooth and ANT+. \n \n\nMedM Apps are compatible with products of the following vendors: \n \nA&D Medical, Aerotel, AndesFit, ARKRAY, AViTa, Bayer Vital, Berry, Biolight, Bodimetrics, Borsam, CGS Sensors, ChoiceMMed, Coagusense, Contec, Cosinuss, Creative Industry, D-Heart, eHealthSource, Entra Health Systems Co.

      "label": "The AHA ACLS app is the American Heart Association's (AHA) officially endorsed digital health solution to assist clinicians in running codes and delivering bedside ACLS care with actual patients. The app was developed by Harvard-trained physicians, in collaboration with the AHA, to help fellow physicians, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and emergency medical technicians (EMT) deliver the highest level of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) at the point-of-care. It began as a project to assist clinicians within Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital—and then expanded to have a global scope after significant positive impact was demonstrated. Importantly, real-time feedback from our clinician users continuously drives improvements in app design, features, and function so that you will have the best experience providing life-saving care at the bedside.\n \nThe AHA ACLS app is the only one to have all content vetted by both the AHA science team and practicing Harvard-affiliated physicians. It also features the latest 2020 release of AHA recommendations for ACLS. \n \nWe owe it to our patients to use the best digital health tools to give them the highest chance of surviving acute life-threatening cardiac illnesses.

Meticulously built over ten years from high-resolution cross-sectional photographs of real cadavers, the app provides an accurate and visually stunning reconstruction of the anatomy of the entire body.\n\nThe easy to use and intuitive interface lets you choose precisely the anatomy you want to see, from exactly the angle you want to see it. This flexibility is supported by a wealth of user-friendly tools to help you set up your ideal anatomical image, quickly and easily:\n\n•\tThe Gallery contains 21 pre-set scenes, designed by an in-house team of anatomical experts, to clearly and comprehensibly present in-depth regional and systemic anatomy of the body. Each scene is divided into five layers to provide greater control over the depth of anatomy shown; making tailoring the anatomy you want to see simple and quick.\n\n•\tThe Contents folders arrange all 2,000+ structures systemically, meaning you can browse by subcategory and switch all related structures on at once. It provides an excellent learning tool – for example turn on all branches of the superior mesenteric artery, or all the muscles of the abdominal wall.\n\n•\tThe Contents layer controls split each system into five layers – from deep to superficial. This allows you to quickly build up different systems to the depth you want to see.\n\n**Save to Favourites**\n\nSave the views you create for later in the Favourites, save anything as an image, or share with another user as a URL link. Use the pins, labels and drawing tools to customize your images for enlivened presentations, engaging course materials and handouts – all from your iPad!\n\n**Informative**\n\nRead detailed and accurate text for each structure using the T icon, and in a feature unique to Primal Pictures, each anatomical term in the text is linked to the appropriate model in the 3D model. Selecting these links will highlight the relevant structures, bringing the text to life and make learning anatomy more visual and immediate.\n\n**Context**\n\nSee each structure in context with the anatomy that surrounds it. Explore these relationships and easily navigate to related anatomical structures to expand your learning. Select a field name in the right-hand menu to show the anatomical category and sub-category of the structure for added understanding and simple navigation."

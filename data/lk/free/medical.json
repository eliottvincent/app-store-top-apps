You can now consult government doctors for free via oDoc from wherever you are.\n\nAs of January 2020, oDoc, Sri Lanka’s largest telemedicine platform, has over 1000 partner GPs and specialists, including many senior consultants across 60+ specialisations. All doctors on oDoc are Sri Lanka Medical Council registered with 5+ years of experience. They are well equipped to manage oDoc consultations and issue prescriptions. This means you have access to high-quality care without the hassle of traffic, waiting rooms and queues.\n\nDoesn't it sound perfect? However, you may wonder how a doctor can correctly diagnose you without seeing you in person? Well, it's very much like any other doctor consultation you’ve had! Understanding your medical history and your symptoms is as important as a physical examination. According to the American Medical Association, 75% of doctor consultations can be diagnosed online, and our doctors are skilled in providing a diagnosis and medical advice online.\n\nAs a policy, we refund you in the event your doctor determines a physical examination is required. In these cases, the doctor will be paid by us. This means you pay only when you receive care, and doctors are always compensated for their professional services.\n\nOn oDoc, you own all your data, and your data is stored securely on HIPAA-compliant servers."

They are attracted by light, body odor, lactic acid, carbon dioxide and heat.\n\nTurn on the application and keep it close to you it will produce high frequency sound and mosquitos will avert you. It is not 100% guaranteed but will repel most of mosquitos biting you. Its not foolproof because there are about 3500 admitted mosquito species in the world and they all react marginally different to the repeller.\n\nUse the frequency controls to find the excellent frequency for your place and enjoy outdoors without pesky bugs like mosquitos to annoy you!"

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.

Download the free Elsevier Clinical Pharmacology App\n2.   Sign in securely using your Clinical Pharmacology or Institution account\n\nTrusted by over 2,000 hospitals and 35,000 retail pharmacies, Clinical Pharmacology offers easy-to-find answers to all drug questions as compiled by an editorial team consisting entirely of PharmDs. Clinical Pharmacology is the most current and comprehensive drug reference compendium available.\n\nFAST, ACCURATE & RELIABLE\nClinical Pharmacology Mobile offers the fastest path to accurate answers and provides convenient access to the features and functionality that clinicians rely on most from Clinical Pharmacology, even when you are offline!\n\nSMART SEARCH\nPowerful multi-concept search by drug name, indication, contraindication or adverse reaction to quickly find the precise drug information you need. Robust tools to assist your search, such as predictive type-ahead, search history, and scoped search by drug classification, product or monograph.\n\nEASILY DIGESTIBLE INFORMATION & ACTIONABLE DATA\nThe same authoritative content, but more concise and presented in the form of an answer funnel – tap thru to only the level of detail you require. Toggle multiple views within the same interface to find the right clinical lens - Adult versus Pediatric dosing, On versus Off Label use by indication, and more. Strategic use of info-graphics instead of text to provide answers at a glance. \n\nDRUG IDENTIFIER\nEasily identify pills using the imprint or by physical characteristics such as shape, color, scoring or dosage form. Dynamic imprint matches save you time, with type-ahead surfacing the drug name and thumbnail for immediate verification. Results feature multiple ways to aid visual identification, including full-screen, high-resolution drug images.\n\nPOWERFUL CLINICAL TOOLS \nEvidence-supported clinical algorithms to quickly identify drug interactions or adverse reactions:\n• Drug-to-drug interaction report: immediate feedback on interactions as you enter drugs, leading to an easy-to-scan synoptic description of interactions categorized by severity. Unique to Clinical Pharmacology, optionally check for interactions between drugs and other life-style factors such as diet, smoking, alcohol consumption and more. Tap through the synopsis to see a detailed description of the interaction, which can be toggled between a professional and consumer view to share and consult with patients. \n• Adverse reaction report (ADR): using the only algorithm of its kind on the market, enter either a single drug or a combination of drugs and see the adverse reactions they cause. Easily filter and sort the report by key clinical factors such as severity, incidence and onset.\n\nFEWER TAPS, QUICKER ANSWERS \nBuilt by clinicians for clinicians, speed to answer was the operating principle that guided every decision around the app’s navigation, flow and content structure. Each major feature is one-tap away, and all extraneous steps have been removed or optimized to complement a clinician’s busy workflow. \n\nQUESTIONS/FEEDBACK\nAdditional questions or problems accessing the application?

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

This easy-to-use and convenient format will further assist health care professionals in their implementation of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®), thus improving the quality and effectiveness of care provided to patients with cancer. \n\nNCCN is a not-for-profit alliance of leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education. NCCN is dedicated to improving and facilitating quality, effective, efficient, and accessible cancer care so patients can live better lives. Through the leadership and expertise of clinical professionals at NCCN Member Institutions, NCCN develops resources that present valuable information to the numerous stakeholders in the health care delivery system. By defining and advancing high-quality cancer care, NCCN promotes the importance of continuous quality improvement and recognizes the significance of creating clinical practice guidelines appropriate for use by patients, clinicians, and other health care decision-makers around the world.\n\nOver the past 25 years, NCCN has developed an integrated suite of tools to improve the quality of cancer care. The NCCN Guidelines® document evidence-based, consensus-driven management to ensure that all patients receive preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and supportive services that are most likely to lead to optimal outcomes. \n\nThe NCCN Guidelines are a comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and interventions that apply to 97 percent of cancer cases in the United States. In addition, separate guidelines relate to major prevention and screening topics and another set of pathways focuses on the major supportive care areas. \n\nThe NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations based on the best evidence available at the time they are derived. Because new data are published continuously, it is essential that the NCCN Guidelines also be continuously updated and revised to reflect new data and new clinical information. The intent of the NCCN Guidelines is to assist in the decision-making process of individuals involved in cancer care—including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, payers, patients and their families—with the ultimate goal of improving patient care and outcomes. The NCCN Guidelines provide recommendations for appropriate care for most but not all patients; however, individual patient circumstances must be considered when applying these recommendations. \n\nVisit NCCN.org to learn more about the NCCN Guidelines as well as other NCCN Content."

By measuring the tender and swollen joint counts (TJC & SJC respectively), CRP (c-reactive protein) and General Health, the DAS 28-4 gives an estimate of disease activity, while the DAS 28-3 uses just the TJC, SJC & CRP. Clinicians, rheumatologists in training, educators and researchers use this tool everyday and now you can have it readily available on your Apple mobile device.\n\nThe following formulas are free for you to try.\n• DAS28-CRP\n• DAS28-CRP (3 Variable)\n• DAS/DAS28 Converter\nYou may use these forever and never be nagged.

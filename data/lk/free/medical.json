You can now consult government doctors for free via oDoc from wherever you are.\n\nAs of January 2020, oDoc, Sri Lanka’s largest telemedicine platform, has over 1000 partner GPs and specialists, including many senior consultants across 60+ specialisations. All doctors on oDoc are Sri Lanka Medical Council registered with 5+ years of experience. They are well equipped to manage oDoc consultations and issue prescriptions. This means you have access to high-quality care without the hassle of traffic, waiting rooms and queues.\n\nDoesn't it sound perfect? However, you may wonder how a doctor can correctly diagnose you without seeing you in person? Well, it's very much like any other doctor consultation you’ve had! Understanding your medical history and your symptoms is as important as a physical examination. According to the American Medical Association, 75% of doctor consultations can be diagnosed online, and our doctors are skilled in providing a diagnosis and medical advice online.\n\nAs a policy, we refund you in the event your doctor determines a physical examination is required. In these cases, the doctor will be paid by us. This means you pay only when you receive care, and doctors are always compensated for their professional services.\n\nOn oDoc, you own all your data, and your data is stored securely on HIPAA-compliant servers."

For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "“We designed this ECG App with the goal of making electrocardiogram reading as easy as possible. With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves. It's not easy but with the help of this app EKG makes more sense to me.\"\n\n\"This is a great App that exemplifies and provides easy training for medical professionals.

The app will help to track your contractions and determine when it's time to go to the hospital.\nIf you plan on having a home birth, the app will tell you what stage of labor you are in at any given moment.\n\nKeep track of your labor by tapping a single button at the start and at the end of each contraction. The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there. Trust what your body is telling you.\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, please email us at neumandev@gmail.com. Your feedback is very important to us."

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

With optional sharing and reminders, Health app support, and custom goals, there's no better way to stay on top of your blood pressure. \n\nMEASURE\n• Automatically record blood pressure from compatible Bluetooth Smart blood pressure meters including A&D, Oregon Scientific, HoMedics, Samico, Pyle.\n• Manually enter readings from any blood pressure monitor — no Bluetooth required.\n• Add notes to help you remember what you were doing at the time.\n• Note: the HeartStar app does not itself measure blood pressure — a separate blood pressure monitor is required — no app can accurately measure your blood pressure without a blood pressure cuff.\n\nSTAY MOTIVATED\n• Create reminders to help you remember to measure your blood pressure on a regular basis.\n• Set achievable goals tailored to your particular situation\n• Get immediate, personalized feedback on your readings and progress.\n• Collect HeartStar points! When you record a new measurement, you will be rewarded with points based on how that measurement helps you reach your goals. HeartStar points give you a new way to measure your overall progress. A steady increase in points means you're consistently recording your blood pressure and making good progress toward your goals. Challenge yourself to reach the next level!\n\nGRAPH and ANALYZE\n• Visualize patterns in your blood pressure history to help you understand your activity patterns.\n\nSYNC and SHARE\n• Sync readings to and from Apple's Health app\n• Share your history and reports with your family or physician: HeartStar makes it easy to communicate your results to the people you want. Plus, download your history so you always have a copy on hand.\n• Import and export measurements\n\nMULTI-USER\n• Use HeartStar with the whole family — it's easy to add new users and switch between users.\n\nHELP and FEEDBACK\n• Help and customer support built into the app — just tap the Info button — we're here for you and love hearing from you.\n\nThank you for helping make HeartStar number one!\n\nDISCLAIMER\nHeartStar is intended to be used as a means to collect data to be shared with your doctor.

Your doctor can calculate it from the results of your blood creatinine test, your age, body size and gender. Your GFR tells your doctor your stage of kidney disease and helps the doctor plan your treatment. If your GFR number is low, your kidneys are not working as well as they should. The earlier kidney disease is detected, the better the chance of slowing or stopping its progression.\r\nThis App includes 5 equations for calculating eGFR (Glomerular filtration rate).\r\n- CKD-EPI Creatinine (2009)\r\n- Cockcroft-Gault\r\n- MDRD \r\n- CKD-EPI cystatin C (2012)\r\n- Bedside Schwartz is for children and people under 19 years old\r\nWe also provide a table that compares GFR indicators with the stages of chronic kidney disease.

OB Wheels combines three things that clinicians need to derive all the dates necessary in pregnancy care, and no other app has this combination.   \n\nIt contains a calendar calculator to determine EDD (EDC) from LMP or from a sonogram report.  The calendar calculator also provides gestational age (EGA) as of any date for a given EDD or LMP.  Because the calculator works off the real calendar, it is accurate for leap years too.\n\nThen for all of you who miss your cardboard OB wheel, the app contains one which you can rotate, pinch and zoom, and generally play with just like a regular cardboard wheel.  It's a little tricky to learn how to plant two fingers and rotate them rather than pinch-and-zoom to get rotation versus resizing.  But the wheel works and it is accurate, especially so because you can zoom in to be sure where the little date hash lines lie.\n\nFinally, the app notes the most recent committee opinion scheme from ACOG on how one might reconcile due dates from LMP and sonograms to arrive at a single final EDD.  To my knowledge, the scheme is authority-based and no better or worse than other schemes, but my practice and my learners need a single clear scheme, so this app includes one for easy reference.\n\nAs an educator and clinician myself, I am grateful for feedback.  Email me via the contact email at my website."

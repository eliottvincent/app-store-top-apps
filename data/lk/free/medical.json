You can now consult government doctors for free via oDoc from wherever you are.\n\nAs of January 2020, oDoc, Sri Lanka’s largest telemedicine platform, has over 1000 partner GPs and specialists, including many senior consultants across 60+ specialisations. All doctors on oDoc are Sri Lanka Medical Council registered with 5+ years of experience. They are well equipped to manage oDoc consultations and issue prescriptions. This means you have access to high-quality care without the hassle of traffic, waiting rooms and queues.\n\nDoesn't it sound perfect? However, you may wonder how a doctor can correctly diagnose you without seeing you in person? Well, it's very much like any other doctor consultation you’ve had! Understanding your medical history and your symptoms is as important as a physical examination. According to the American Medical Association, 75% of doctor consultations can be diagnosed online, and our doctors are skilled in providing a diagnosis and medical advice online.\n\nAs a policy, we refund you in the event your doctor determines a physical examination is required. In these cases, the doctor will be paid by us. This means you pay only when you receive care, and doctors are always compensated for their professional services.\n\nOn oDoc, you own all your data, and your data is stored securely on HIPAA-compliant servers."

      "label": "Blood pressure monitor & heart rate tracker app - Our application does not measure blood pressure. The app allows you to track it. For measurement use, FDA-approved blood pressure monitors.\n\nApp Main Features:\n \n- Modern and user-friendly interface\n- High blood pressure control\n- Clear graphs\n- Measurement history\n- Reminders and notifications\n\nBlood Pressure Levels:\n\nNormal: Systolic 90-119 and Diastolic 60-79\nHypotension: Systolic 90 and less or Diastolic 60 and less\nElevated: Systolic 120-129 and Diastolic 60-80\nHypertension - Stage 1: Systolic 130-139 or Diastolic 80-90\nHypertension - Stage 2: Systolic 140-180 or Diastolic 90-120\nHypertensive: Systolic 180 and higher or Diastolic 120 and higher\n\nAging Adults:\n\nIn adults, systolic blood pressure rises from early adulthood onward, up to at least age 70. Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves.

If you want, you can get to know the most important structures that can be demonstrated in ultrasound and then apply and deepen your knowledge in the ultrasound simulator. This will help you understand the growth of your own baby.\n\nScanBaby is divided into three different modes:\n\n-Scan mode: Here you can scan a baby all by yourself (not your own actual baby). Turn on labelling mode to see all the important structures colored. This way you can compare the ScanBaby image to your own ultrasound image and understand the shown structures better.\n\n-Learn mode: This beautifully crafted mode teaches you about the developmental stages of your child. Get to know all the changes that happen to you and your baby during pregnancy. We have included artfully crafted 3D scans of real babies that you can move around all by yourself and experience how your baby might currently look like. Of course all of these scans come with labelling as well.\n\n-Watch mode: Here we have included many different ultrasound videos you might actually see in a similar way during your own examination. All come with a short explanation what can be seen. Watch a baby dance inside the uterus, play with the umbilical cord and even react to the caressing of the father.\nTerms of use: https://scanbooster.com/index.php/impressum#qx-heading-1479"

It is based on Dr. Rogers' physical print bilingual medical dictionary, which was first published in 1991, has gone through 4 editions, and is considered an authority on English and Spanish medical terminology translation.\n\nCore Features:\n- Translations for over 16,000 terms\n- Bookmarks so you can save terms to study later\n- Extensive Dialogue section covering a typical H&P and conversation related to nursing, pediatrics, dentistry, radiology, vaccination, and end-of-life\n\nThe Dictionary Covers:\n- Any medical term likely to occur in a conversation between a health professional and a patient\n- Technical terms sometimes used with patients (e.g., viral load, axillary lymph node status, glycemic index)\n- Recently popularized terms (e.g., super-spreader, vaccine hesitancy, social distancing)\n- The generic names for over 700 medications\n- Phrases (e.g., short of breath, to grow out of, to run out)\n- Terms which are not strictly medical but occur frequently in conversations with patients (e.g., safe, probably, copay, room, to recommend, to be due for)\n- And more!\n\nTranslations Include:\n- Parts of speech and irregular inflections\n- Audio clips demonstrating proper pronunciation\n- Regionalisms and slang\n- Example phrases and editorial comments\n\nContent has been vetted by:\n- Consultation over the years with 30 physicians from 17 different countries and a bilingual linguist\n- Frequency analyses on large databases, both technical and lay, broken down by region\n- Feedback over 30 years on the past 4 print editions of the dictionary\n\nRogers Dictionary and all of its translations are completely free! The app does include ads that we use to recoup development and operations costs.\n\nBeginners will use the app for vocabulary building and can profit from the extensive Dialogue section. More advanced speakers can use the app on the fly to find the right term needed to get a point across. Professional translators and interpreters will find the app sufficiently rigorous for the most demanding setting, whether for a government document or in the ICU.\n\nHigh praise from a medical Spanish professional:\n“This bilingual medical dictionary is the most comprehensive and extensive I have encountered in my 40 years of teaching and authoring Medical Spanish textbooks. It incorporates all the latest terms, and all possible translations for each term, as well as variations from country to country. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would enthusiastically give it an 11!”\n  —Joanna Ríos, PhD"

The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

For your vaccination status (England only) use the separate NHS app, go to www.nhs.uk/app\n\nCOVID-19 has not gone away, so it’s important to remember the actions you can take to keep yourself and others safe. Everybody needs to continue to act carefully and remain cautious.\n\nDownload the app and keep it up to date to receive the latest guidance.\n\nThe app uses proven privacy software developed by Apple and Google, designed so that nobody will know who or where you are. You can delete your data, or the app, at any time.\n\nThe NHS COVID-19 app features:\n\nAlerts: Find out when you’ve been near other app users who have since tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nLatest information: Find out the latest COVID-19 guidance and know the level of COVID-19 risk in your local area.\n\nSymptoms: Check if you have COVID-19 symptoms and follow the latest guidance.\n\nTest:  Enter any positive test result (NHS or paid-for) to anonymously notify other app users who were near you that they might be at risk. You'll also get the latest health advice.\n \nAvailable in English, Welsh, Arabic (Modern Standard), Bengali, Chinese (Simplified), Gujarati, Polish, Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), Romanian, Somali, Turkish and Urdu.\n\nThe app can be used when travelling across England, Wales, Jersey and Gibraltar, detecting contact tracing app users (regardless of them using different official apps), and alerting them if they have been in contact with someone who later reported a positive test result in the app.\n\nThe app has been built in collaboration with some of the most innovative organisations in the world. We have worked with medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and we’ve shared knowledge with the teams working on similar apps in many countries.\n\nThe app is UKCA marked as Class I medical device in the United Kingdom and developed in compliance with Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended)."

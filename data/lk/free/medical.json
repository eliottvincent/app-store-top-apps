You can now consult government doctors for free via oDoc from wherever you are.\n\nAs of January 2020, oDoc, Sri Lanka’s largest telemedicine platform, has over 1000 partner GPs and specialists, including many senior consultants across 60+ specialisations. All doctors on oDoc are Sri Lanka Medical Council registered with 5+ years of experience. They are well equipped to manage oDoc consultations and issue prescriptions. This means you have access to high-quality care without the hassle of traffic, waiting rooms and queues.\n\nDoesn't it sound perfect? However, you may wonder how a doctor can correctly diagnose you without seeing you in person? Well, it's very much like any other doctor consultation you’ve had! Understanding your medical history and your symptoms is as important as a physical examination. According to the American Medical Association, 75% of doctor consultations can be diagnosed online, and our doctors are skilled in providing a diagnosis and medical advice online.\n\nAs a policy, we refund you in the event your doctor determines a physical examination is required. In these cases, the doctor will be paid by us. This means you pay only when you receive care, and doctors are always compensated for their professional services.\n\nOn oDoc, you own all your data, and your data is stored securely on HIPAA-compliant servers."

Diastolic pressure tends to begin to rise at the same time but starts to fall earlier in mid-life, approximately age 55. Mean blood pressure rises from early adulthood, plateauing in mid-life, while pulse pressure rises quite markedly after the age of 40.\n\nConsequently, in many older people, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range. The rise in pulse pressure with age is attributed to increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nStay healthy!"

      "label": "My Baby Heart Sounds is a quick and easy way to use your iPhone to listen, record and share your baby's heart sounds.\n\nNot too long ago, we were pregnant mothers too. While our partners enjoyed listening to our babies' sounds by placing their ears on the tummy, we wanted to capture and share these precious audio-memories ourselves. We tried voice memo apps and other sound-recording apps but felt that there was something more we could do to improve the quality of the sound in a simple setup. Fast forward a couple years and here we are!\n\nWhy should you try this app?\n- Minimum time to setup. All you need is your iPhone. Simple instructions are provided within the app and we are here to support you all the way.\n- High quality sound. Using advanced audio signal processing techniques, we deliver a high quality audio experience that allows you to distinguish your baby's heart sounds. For best results use AirPods.\n- Listen for free and only pay when you want to record and share.\n- Secure. All recordings are stored on your phone. We do not have any access to your recordings. You decide how you would like to share your recordings.\n\nFree version:\nWith the free version, listen to your baby's heart sounds unlimited number of times. When you are satisfied, you can purchase a premium version that allows you to record and share unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories.\n\nOne time in-app purchase:\n- Features included in Free version.\n- Create unlimited audio recordings of special moments and memories. This feature requires a one time in app purchase. \n- Tag locations to remember and visualize where your chances are best for the next time you would like to hear your baby's heart sound.\n- When you would like to share the recording, multiple options are provided that include email, text and other social media apps. \n- Store the recording outside the app on your device or external storage apps.\n\nFor best results:\n- Use the app when you are 20-30 weeks or greater pregnant.\n- Use the app in a quiet room\n- Remove any phone case/shell/cover (the iPhone needs to touch your skin to be able to pick up the sounds)\n- Put the phone in Airplane Mode\n- Start the app and place the iPhone on your tummy to listen for a clear sound. You may need to try a few different spots. Press \"Record\" to create a recording\n- Use AirPods\n\nMy Baby Heart Sounds Disclaimer:\n- The My Baby Heart Sounds app is NOT a Medical Device or application. It is NOT in any way suitable for medical opinion, advice or diagnosis, and it is NOT intended to provide any information about the person of use's wellbeing or health.\n- The app does NOT backup recordings automatically outside the user's device. It is the user's responsibility to regularly backup their recordings."

With thousands of fully interpreted ECG cases, comes a great skillset and confidence in ECG reading.\"\n\nEmpower doctors, doctors to-be, and paramedics with high quality ECG cases and full interpretations of each finding, to help gain crucial medical knowledge and ECG reading skills. \nECG Pro App has proved to be very useful for reference on ECG readings. Everything is interwoven beautifully and it reduces the need to look at many different sources.\n\nOver 5m users are using ECG Pro to learn and sharpen electrocardiography knowledge and skills! They are medical students and teachers, primary healthcare providers, physicians, practitioners, and nurses. Join them today to get your ECG knowledge refresh.\n\nMedical App Editor's Review:\nHere is a rich collection of real 12-lead ECG cases you can use to develop your interpretation skills. Each case is identified with a brief description (e.g., \"Male 73 y/o, HR 158; Ectopic arrhythmia - atrial tachycardia with intraventricular aberrant conduction...\"). Select a case and you can choose either Play mode, which shows you the ECG telemetry as you'd see it on a monitor in real-time, with beeps for heartbeats, or Read mode, which gives you the printed ECG tracing to interpret. You can choose cases by category or search for them by name. You can also bookmark cases and return to them later.\n\nFor students and practitioners who wish to strengthen their ECG-reading capabilities, this app would seem justified, because ECG Cases gives you an effective way to immerse yourself in a wide range of ECG patterns and interact with them as if these were your own patients.\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\"I'm reviewing the app with my father who happens to be a specialist in internal medicine, and we're astonished by this app's capability in helping students like myself understand EKG waves.

Measure your stress to manage it!\n\n- What is the principle behind StressScan? − \nMany of the functions essential to maintaining human health are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is medically recognized that the balance of the autonomic nervous system can become disordered through fatigue and other stress, stemming from causes such as work and human relationships. By analyzing the waveform of your heartbeat as measured at the fingertip, StressScan can analyze the balance of your autonomic nervous system and measure your stress level on a stress index of 1 to 100.\n\n- You can trust StressScan! - \nThe technology used by StressScan is based on heart rate variability analysis, which is widely recognized in the field of heart rate analysis and autonomic nervous system research. \nAlthough heart rate variability analysis technology is not yet generally well known, many medical institutions and companies have taken an interest and are beginning to put it to use. The technology is seeing use even at the cutting edge of stress care, including adoption by the US military to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers returning from the battlefield, and by NASA for astronaut training and health management.\n\n- Usable in a range of scenarios! - \n· Periodic checking of daily stress level\n· Checking the effects of favorite meals and drinks on stress\n· Checking relaxation while traveling or at a favorite spot\n\n- Device compatibility -\nThe app is intended for use with a camera- and flash-equipped smartphone. It is not usable with devices that do not have a camera and flash.\n\n- Usage environment -\nAn Internet connection is required to use the app. External support for measurement functions is used for complex stress analysis."

      "label": "eScription One allows authorized clinicians to create and manage high quality documentation for an EMR with minimal time and effort. Clinicians dictate the narrative and keep pace with busy patient loads without compromising time with patients, revenue potential or length of workday. Meanwhile, timely, complete, structured data in the EMR reduces claim rejections, decreases time to bill and enhances compliance.\n\nA real-time schedule feed serves as a daily work list while access to patient demographics and history informs dictations. System-generated dictation templates – personalized by each clinician – streamline document creation by requiring only exceptions be dictated. Transcribed content is easily reviewed, edited and signed. Upon completion, uploaded files are automatically integrated into the EMR, faxed, or printed. \n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n* iOS 15.2 or greater\n\n* Internet access through Wifi or phone service provider is required. WiFi connection is strongly recommended when uploading dictations.\n\n* An account is required to use this application.\n\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS:\n* Manage the documentation task with less time and effort. Clinicians organize documentation tasks across multiple devices by viewing all appointments with dictation status or only appointments still requiring dictation. A list of returned transcriptions allows clinicians to advance quickly through the review and authentication process.\n\n* Improve documentation quality. Save time and remove risk when patient data, demographics and appointment location are automatically linked to the voice file and available for easy reference while dictating.\n\n* Customize workflow to meet clinic needs. Flexible application settings easily accommodate the unique, complex workflow requirements of specialty practices. \n\n* Delegate transcription and QA to support staff. Completed dictations upload in the background and are automatically routed to a professional medical transcriptionist to produce a typed report that is automatically returned for review.\n\n* Increase clinician productivity and satisfaction. A library of templates—customizable for each clinician—automatically populates common content as editable text, speeding dictation. \n\n* Speed documentation turnaround. Real-time file upload, download and routing ensures prompt dictation, transcription, editing, authentication and accessibility in the EMR. \n\n* Populate the EMR automatically. Sophisticated integration generates structured data automatically placed in the EMR, improving EMR usability and boosting adoption and ROI. \n\n* Enhance the patient experience By completing documentation on mobile devices, providers are free to engage with patients rather than computer screens during exams.\n\n* Control documentation costs All-inclusive solution components require no server hardware or infrastructure, eliminating all upfront fees. Unlimited client support, updates and maintenance included at no additional cost.\n\nWHAT CLIENTS ARE SAYING:\n“When we introduced our physicians to Emdat Mobile, all of them were amazed by how easy it made their dictation and improved their workflow; and they wanted it right away.”\n\n— William Whelehan, Purchasing Director, Illinois Bone & Joint Institute"

The app does not store or communicate the scanned information to third parties. The app performs the verification in offline mode, i.e. without invoking a remote system service when it is used. In order to verify the certificate authenticity the app must access the backend of the DGC national platfor at least once a day, connected to the European gateway (DGCG), where all the public keys used to sign the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate” are collected.\r\n\r\nThe workflow of the VerificationC19 app is divided into the following phases:\r\n- The person who must verify the certification asks the user to show the QR code of his certificate\r\n- Using the app, the QR code is read and its authenticity is verified using the public key signing the certificate\r\n- Once the information contained in the COVID-19 Green Certification or the \"EU Digital COVID Certificate\" has been decoded, the app shows the main information:\r\n- Name, surname and date of birth of the certificate holder\r\n- Unique identifier of the certificate\r\n- Validity of the certificate\r\n- The certificate is verified against the decoded date information and the Italian rules for COVID-19 green certifications.\r\n- The person in charge proceeds to visually check the correspondence of the personal data of the holder shown by the VerificationC19 app and certificate holder ID card."

And there is no more reliable resource for trauma information than the American College of Surgeons (ACS).  This app was developed alongside their seminal course, Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS). ATLS has trained more than 1.5 million participants in more than 75,000 courses around the world.    \n\nATLS provides the essential information and skills for doctors, nurses, and other health professionals to identify and treat life-threatening injuries under the extreme pressures of the trauma environment. The international nature of the program means that the content is adaptable to a variety of geographic, economic, social, and medical practice situations.\n\nWhether in a hospital trauma bay, on the highway at a motor vehicle crash, in a disaster area after a bombing, or in a foreign country’s war zone, clinicians need ready access to critical resources and references.   The content and skills presented in this app will add to the armamentarium of doctors and other clinicians who treat trauma patients.  \n\nThe app includes a free preview of the 1st chapter.\n\nAdditional content can be purchased to instantly gain full access to the following:\n• Interactive visuals, such as treatment algorithms and x-ray identification \n• Just in Time video segments capturing key skills in minutes \n• Calculators, such as pediatric burn calculator and the Parkland Formula to determine fluid administration\n• Animations, such as airway management and surgical cricothyroidotomy\n\nFor those who have purchased the 9th edition of the ATLS Student Course Manual, simply enter the book code that was packaged in the book to gain free access to all the content."

      "label": "YOU are the reason for the MaNaDr app. This app is your link to your trusted doctor. You can book appointments and chat with YOUR doctor, rather than a random doctor that you are unsure of. You will be able to book appointments for your family and friends with your trusted doctor. You will be able to schedule home care visits with your doctor and his/her trusted providers. Soon you will also be able to buy products that your doctor has curated and screened for you. The key is trust.\n\nAppointment bookings are secure and in real time. Your trusted doctor’s available time slots can be viewed from the app and you can choose the date, time and location to suit your convenience. Booking can be done 24/7 anytime, anywhere. You will receive reminders of your upcoming appointments and can view previous appointments. Reschedule or cancel your appointments through the app (within specified time limits). \n\nChat with your trusted doctor. Maybe you have a quick question that doesn’t need a trip down to the doctor. Your trusted doctor knows you and your medical history. He or she will be the best person to give you advice. With MaNaDr, you can quickly open a chat or a video consult with your trusted doctor. At the end of the chat, get a summary report from your doctor.\n\nNeed a home visit? Not just a doctor’s visit, but perhaps for nursing care, physiotherapy or other home care services? Look for your trusted doctor’s home care provider and book an appointment directly.\n\nChildren and the elderly without mobile devices are not left out. Add them as your family or friends and book appointments on their behalf.\n\nMaNaDr aims to be the one app for you and your family’s healthcare needs, from infancy to the golden years. For now, we connect you to your trusted healthcare provider but there will be much more to come. Stay tuned!\n\nYour healthcare data is secure. All communication between the mobile apps and our servers are secured by 256 bit SSL. \n\nThis app is currently applicable only in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia.\n\nBooking fees and consultation charges may apply."

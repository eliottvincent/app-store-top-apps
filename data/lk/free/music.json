The professional instrument quality sounds of this application, simple but advanced customization options and professional level signal processing settings, sets this application apart from other such apps available today.\n\nScroll left or right to choose the appropriate pitch (Shruti). If needed, the pitch can be manually adjusted to 1 cent resolution. The tempo of Tanpura plucking and overall volume of the sounds can also be modified.\n\nThe app allows choosing different middle notes (Pa, Ma, Ni 1, Ni 2, None) and suitable tuning temperaments (Equal Tempered, Just Tuning and Manual Tuning). Equal Temperament is the standard tuning used in modern music, but traditional Indian music typically uses Just Tuning. When Manual Tuning is selected, the middle note (Pa, Ma, Ni 1, Ni 2) can be manually tuned to 1 cent resolution. \n\nThe reset button restores the default settings without changing the currently chosen pitch.\n\nSettings allows choosing Tanpura octave (Low/High), Tanpura tone (Mellow, Deep) and plucking style (Soft, Medium). In addition, the master tuning of the Tanpura can be changed from A4 = 440 Hz (default) to A4 = 432 Hz."

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "Moovit is one app for all your urban mobility and transit rides. \n\nTransportation is an integral part of urban living. Whether you ride the train, subway, bus, light rail, ferry or metro, use dockless scooters, bikes, ride-sharing like Uber or Lyft, getting the best urban mobility information is critical. Enter Moovit! Moovit provides riders with a one-stop-shop journey experience to help them get from point A to B in the easiest and most efficient way. Get train and bus times, maps, and real-time arrival information with ease so that you can plan your trip with confidence. Pay and validate your rides.

Get step-by-step directions of optimal route bus, train, metro, bike, scooter or a combination of them. \n\nMoovit guides more than 930 million users in over 3400 cities throughout the world. Commuters will find updated bus and train times, transit maps, and, where available, real-time line arrivals. Locate nearby bus stops and train stations, travel with on-the-go live navigation guidance, receive get-off alerts when approaching your destination to ensure a smooth ride. That's why Moovit has been named one of the best apps of the year in 2017 by the App Store.\n\nMoovit is your personal assistant for all your transit rides! \n\n► Real-time arrivals. View real-time arrival information, which is taken directly from GPS devices positioned on buses and trains. Avoid wasting time guessing train times or bus times.\n\n► Digital payment. Purchase bus & train tickets and validate your digital pass with a tap (select cities). \n\n► Real time alerts. Know about issues ahead of time by receiving service alerts such as emergency or unexpected disruptions, delays, traffic jams, new construction, and more so that you can plan ahead if your bus time or train time changed.\n\n► Live Directions. Get step-by-step bus directions and other transit directions with live guidance from A-to-B: Know how long you need to walk to your station, view your line's arrival time, receive get-off alerts as you approach your destination, and more. \n\n► Visualize Your Stop. Use augmented reality to locate your bus or train stop with \"Way Finder\".\n\n► User reports. Moovit’s users report issues found with stations, line service, and schedules so that we can inform all nearby riders about what’s going on in their area.\n\n► Favorite lines, stations, and places. Get easy access to lines, stations, and places you ride and visit all the time. Plus, get real-time updates if/when there are changes to your favorite lines in case your bus time or train time is impacted!\n\n► Bike routes. Get bike routes in addition to the bus, subway, train, or metro trip plans. If you ride bikes (yours or shared) we can plan a route that includes the train or bus. Moovit will help you plan a trip that meets your transit-needs. Bike docking stations are updated in real-time. Bike trip plans are only available in supported metro areas.\n\n► Maps view. Interested in seeing the whole picture? View all stations, routes, and lines on the subway or bus map. Additionally, maps are available in PDF for when you’re offline, or underground on the subway. \n\nMoovit is the #1 urban mobility app in the world.

Choose the people you trust to see your location when needed.\n- Share your GPS location privately. Only your Guardians will be able to see where you are and check on your safety.\n- Notify your Guardians immediately when you are feeling unsafe, using the Emergency Sharing feature\n- Setup forever sharing. You can choose to share your location permanently to certain trusted people.\n- Battery life, network strength and phone status can also be shared.

This is especially handy when driving between cities.\n\nFeatures:\n- Intuitive 3D map, simple navigation\n- Voice Assistance\n- Speed limits\n- Long tap on the map to set the destination\n- Fuel consumption calculation\n- Transit points\n- Search for addresses and POI\n- Choose alternative routes\n- Drive offline right after you start\n- The app will recalculate the route if you leave it\n- Classic GPS map navigation mode\n- Head-up display (HUD) mode\n- Trip info: ETA, speed, distance traveled, directions on the next manoeuvre, and more\n- Based on OpenStreetMap (OSM)\n\nNote: If you face any problems or find any bugs, please email us at support@hudwayapp.com or report the bug right from the app.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $2.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nIf you want to use HUD during a day-time — there is a special accessory HUDWAY Glass: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

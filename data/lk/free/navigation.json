      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

It not only allowed us to layer on where each Fence would be, but also showed us in near real time where we were in relation to our new fences. I gave them five stars because of the time it saved our ranch hands in developing new pastures.\n\n• We used Mapulator for solar panel installation, roof area estimation or trip planning. Along with our faming requirements such as spraying, fertilising, seeding, harvesting farms or tilling.\n\n• I couldn’t love this app anymore. Before I found this app I was about to pay another company several hundred dollars per month for my roofing company’s ability to measure roofs. Then I found this app and it does everything I need it to do for free. The measurements are VERY precise. I’ve ordered 100’s of eagle view Aerial reports with measurements in the past and have measured many of them with this app as practice to see how close I can get to their measurements and they are right on the money most every time. I’m not even sure what all else this app has the ability to do but for what my company and I need, Love it!\n\nFollow us now:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mapulator/\nhttps://www.linkedIn.com/showcase/mapulator/\nhttps://www.twitter.com/mapulator_app/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/mapulator/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC51vFJpJfptBf4yNffMafKg\n\nPrivacy policy: https://mapulator.app/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://mapulator.app/terms-and-conditions/"

In order to use this application, you must have personal account or hosted software.\n\nDemo account credentials:\nE-mail: demo\nPassword: demo123\n\nGPS-server.net features:\n- Real time tracking mode represents live data of tracked objects. Information is updated every ten seconds without need to refresh page or relogin to account. Monitored data contains vehicle status, latitude, longitude, altitude, address, speed, connection time, ignition status, fuel consumption, sensor data, nearest geozone and much more.\n\n- Widgets display recent object information which is updated every ten seconds without need to refresh web page. Send commands to control device, view recent events and mileage graph.\n\n- Events is one of the most important feature which our software offers. Events are used to trigger actions by important or disruptive activities. Customer will get instant SMS/E-mail/Push notifications triggered by different event types.\n\n- History shows all stored data which server has collected from connected devices for chosen period of time. Software stores information received from GPS tracking devices, such as speed, time, location, stops, reports, events, etc. History is displayed in different ways: visually on the map, in a graph or HTML/XLS format.\n\n- POI (Points of Interest) allow you to put markers at the locations that might be interesting or useful. You can also name the place, add short description, attach an image or even video to it.\n\n- Routes feature is a helpful tool to mark an important section of the road by drawing virtual path on the map. Additionally, get notifications if vehicle is within or out of route. This feature is useful to analyze vehicle dependency to the road.\n\n- With geofences you are able to make a virtual perimeter on geographic areas that have specific interest for you. The main reason to have geofences is to control whether the unit stays within it or not, so that when the geofencing unit enters or exits the area a notification is generated.\n\n- Get detailed reports about trips, mileage, driving behavior, fuel usage and thefts, activity in particular zone or route. Reports are used for data analysis of particular vehicle or entire group. Reports can be exported or sent instantly to E-mail addresses in HTML/PDF/XLS format.\n\n- Tasks make it easy to create and manage entries related to upcoming work which should be accomplished. Set start and end address, priority, task status.\n\n- The Maintenance schedule reminds you when you should have your vehicle serviced, such as an oil change or technical inspection. It can also serve as a reminder to take out insurance.\n\n- Use the Expenses function to track the amount spent on an object maintenance. Evaluate the economic benefit of vehicle usage with the Expenditure report on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis."

      "label": "All-in-one assistant with a map, compass, GPS coordinates to view and share in 6 formats, altitude, distance, sunset/sunrise, speedometer with top and average speed, navigator to your target or along the route and a whole lot more!\n\n+ Advanced target/waypoint editor. Can be also used as a coordinates converter. You can use map to check or set waypoint location and add photo or audio note.\n+ Share your location via email, text message, Facebook or Twitter. This includes UTM, MGRS and Latitude/Longitude (MENU>Share my location).\n+ You can use UTM, MGRS or Lat/Long, just pick your preference in settings (Coordinate Format).\n+ Speedometer. Shows you the speed and pace. Speedometer also gives you options to control average and max speed and pace counters (MENU > RESET and PAUSE/RESUME counters).\n+ Compass. Instant reaction compass, no delays. Automatically pickups the direction based on magnetic or GPS course. If you mostly walk or drive, you can change this automatic mode in app settings > Compass or GPS course. NATO mils? Same place in settings to set.\n+ Magnetic declination δ for the current location and any location on the map (via World Magnetic Model, WMM, no need for data/internet).\n+ Sunset and sunrise. So you can plan your travel better.\n+ Arrow pointing to your target waypoint. Distance and bearing to it.\n+ Create/measure routes and areas.\n+ Barometric Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI, IVSI) in both scale and graph forms.\n\nAll above belong to a basic version. PRO Pack upgrade will add following capabilities:\n\n+ Recording and sharing GPS tracks.\n+ Moving waypoints between folders.\n+ Showing ETA to a target as this requires GPS tracking.\n+ Native Google map with fantastic terrain map, amazing 3D and real night mode.\n+ Adding own/custom tile map servers.\n+ Downloading offline maps. Offline maps import in .sqlitedb, rmaps, mbtiles formats.\n+ GPX import and export for waypoints, tracks and routes. \n+ Google Earth KML support for waypoints and tracks import/export. KMZ support for waypoints and tracks export, waypoints import.\n+ CSV import/export for waypoints.\n+ Voice coach to tell you active track distance and duration, current speed and altitude without need to open the app.\n+ Support for Siri shortcuts in IOS 12 for starting and stopping GPS tracks.\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE. App will work in background automatically when tracking. You can use other apps while Compass 55 does its job in the background!\n\n+ PRIVACY. Compass 55 never shares your location data with 3rd parties or ad agencies. Location data is used solely for telling you direction to a target and recording GPS tracks and never leave the app unless you decide to share by means of a track export. It always lets you know when background mode is on and never runs in background unless the track is being recorded.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). As quite a lot of us are using external GPS modules, app is available for wifi only iPads and iPods.\n\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

This means that it will make it easier to drive when you visit EU or USA. \n\nAside from tracking your speed, Speedometer one also can track your distance, altitude, average speed, and top speed. \n\n=== FEATURES OF SPEEDOMETER ONE: ===\n\n\t•\tAccurate Speedometer for Cars, Boats, Motorcycle or other types of Vehicles. \n\t•\tChoose your units mph, km/h, or knots. \n\t•\tSupport Night Mode with high contrast on the screen. \n\t•\tSupport Landscape or Portrait Mode.\n\t•\tSpeed Limit Alert: Enable this option first, and \n\t•\tHUD (Head Unit Display) Mode \n\t•\tSupports USA and EU speed limit. \n\t•\tChoose over 44 themes (22 dark and 22 light) through In-App Purchase. \n\nWhen you use the HUD mode, you can put your iPhone on the dashboard near the windshield.

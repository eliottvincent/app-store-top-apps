Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit.

You can define your extras in advance and add to the trip easily or you can add arbitrary extra amounts to the trip as you drive. You can review trip extras at any moment to remove or edit them.\n\n+ONE TAP TARIFFS SWITCH. You can pick which tariffs to see in the tariffs switch panel and switch with one tap between them.\n\n+CONFIGURABLE NUMBER OF DECIMAL PLACES IN TAXI FARE. Setup speedometer to show 1 or 2 decimal places in a taxi fare, or no decimals at all.\n\n+SQUARE PAYMENTS AND PRINTING. Integrates with Square Point Of Sale app for secure  payments (including credit cards) and also for receipt printing. *Square integration requires in-app upgrade.\n\n+BUILT-IN SPEEDOMETER. As you often need to know the speed when you drive. \n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. No need to pay twice! Taximeter works on iPhones and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics. Side by side and split view is supported on iPads, so you can run navigation apps side by side with taximeter!\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Taximeter automatically works in background when taxi trip is active. You can use other apps while taximeter does its job in the background!\n\nFREE version provides you with 10 taxi trips. If you need more taxi trips please upgrade. If you've ever purchased the paid app or upgraded, please use \"Restore purchases\" button.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Speedometer by HUDWAY offers a brand new way to control speed when driving. A remedy against the speeding tickets, the app keeps you aware on what speed limitation is set for the current road section and alerts when you're exceeding it.\n\nThe app is straight and handy, with no tricky settings. Launch the app and place the phone onto the dashboard close to the windshield (if you want to use it in Head-Up Display or HUD mode and see the reflection on the windshield), or into the mount (for standard use).  It's specifically designed to offer you a safe and non-distracting visual assistance.\n\nPerfectly works in the background — tracks your speed and gives sound alerts when you're exceeding, even when you're using some other app (for example, some navigation one).\n\nHUDWAY Speedometer is a good company in any journey as it:\nKnows current speed limitation (both within cities and on highways);\nWorks in both standard and HUD mode. HUD mode allows using your smartphone or tablet as a projector. Just place your device close to the windshield, and the screen image will get reflected and displayed on the windshield. Keep your eyes on the road — everything you need is displayed right in front of you!\nDoesn't require much attention. The app is designed to be comfortably used without direct focus on it. Your peripheral sight will be enough to keep you aware.\nAlerts on sped limits, as well as on speed cameras and radars.\nDoesn't need Internet connection to work. Needs Internet only at first launch.\nIt simply works. And does it very neatly!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $4.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

It supports HTML 5 + CSS 3, and is based in Webkit. \n\nCroPlus gives you the power to take back control of your Web experience. That’s why we design CroPlus with the most secure and anonymous functionalities. Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser. As such, it inherits all the Midori functionalities. It supports many of the most popular parts of the web, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify and Rdio."

      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "Korean Subway : Smarter Subway\n\nSmarter Subway!\nIntroducing a new level of subway application!!\n\nHi. This is Smarter Subway.\nThe \"Smarter Subway\", which has been loved by many users steadily since its first appearance on February 17, 2011, was reborn in December 2017 with a new look.\n\nCheck out the latest subway map and latest timetable from the new Smarter Subway to the metropolitan area (Seoul Subway, Gyeonggi Subway, Incheon Subway) / Daejeon Subway / Daegu Subway / Busan Subway / Gwangju Subway!\n\n1. Conveniently search for subway stations and routes\n\n• Station name search - If you do not know the location of the station you want to find on the subway map, you can search for the station name and find it. \n• Quick Search - This function allows you to quickly find routes by combining station search and route search. You can set your favorite \"station\" as a departure / arrival station for convenience. \n• Recent Search - Allows you to search back to the most recently searched route.\n\n2. We will inform you of the correct arrival time and station information of the subway.\n\nWe provide train timetables using official city rail data and provide real-time arrival time information in case train arrives late or arrives early. You can also use real-time arrival information for bus stops and available bus lines around the station, and map information around the station. You can also check out various restaurants, coupons, job information and weather information around the station.\n\n3. We recommend the best route according to the user's situation\n\n\"Smarter Subway\" has increased convenience by introducing a dynamic result screen that allows you to change the route from time to time in the Route Results screen instead of the static result window. In the route result, you can select again the departing station, the arrival station / day / time, and you can check the previous / next train of the searched route immediately.\n\n4. We will inform you of the express subway route conveniently.\n\nIn the meantime, users really gave a lot of opinions about the inconvenience to the expressway route map. We have added a detailed view of the subway line express to see at a glance what kind of express trains exist for each subway line, which express train stops at which station, and when the express train departure time is at the station.\n\n5. National subway information\n\n(Seoul, Gyeonggi, Incheon) Subway Line, Busan Subway Line, Daegu Subway Line, Daejeon Subway Line, Gwangju Subway Line\n\n[Optional Access Guide] \n- Location: Checking current location and surrounding station\n- You can use the service even if you do not agree to the optional access right. You can revoke the right to access by the following method. \n\nIf you have any inconveniences or inquiries, please let us know. I will respond quickly. For inquiries, please click \"More\" (the part where the three points are vertically displayed) at the upper right corner of the app. We will always be a kinder (Smarter Subway) who will satisfy users with good service. \n\nThis service includes In-app Purchase items, and a separate fee will be charged for purchase.\n\n- Terms of Service : https://bit.ly/3qfBUTH\n\n- Privacy Policy : https://bit.ly/35JbZdK\n\n[Developer contact] \n- +82-31-8038-2310"

      "label": "Hudway Go is a simple GPS navigation app for drivers. \nIt keeps it very intuitive and non-distracting, displaying just the outline of the road you’re driving and your next manoeuvre.\n\n***\n\"Hudway is one of the cleverest driving apps we've seen\"\n— CNET\n\n\"Hudway app is unbelievably cool for one special reason: It actually lets you see your directions and route right on your windshield\"\n— USA Today\n\n\"Hudway HUD tool will remind you nothing less than a science fiction movie that you watched recently\"\n— crazyengineers.com\n\n\"HUDWAY turns your windshield into a jet fighter cockpit\"\n— digitaltrends.com\n***\n\nHUDWAY Go helps you drive safer in fog, rain, heavy snow, in dusk and darkness.\n\nCreate a route and place your smartphone on the dashboard — you’ll see the route reflected on your windshield. Keep your eyes on the road and know in advance what’s ahead — a straight run, or a ramp-turn. This is especially handy when driving between cities.\n\nFeatures:\n- Intuitive 3D map, simple navigation\n- Voice Assistance\n- Speed limits\n- Long tap on the map to set the destination\n- Fuel consumption calculation\n- Transit points\n- Search for addresses and POI\n- Choose alternative routes\n- Drive offline right after you start\n- The app will recalculate the route if you leave it\n- Classic GPS map navigation mode\n- Head-up display (HUD) mode\n- Trip info: ETA, speed, distance traveled, directions on the next manoeuvre, and more\n- Based on OpenStreetMap (OSM)\n\nNote: If you face any problems or find any bugs, please email us at support@hudwayapp.com or report the bug right from the app.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback!\n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (learn more about it at hudwayglass.com). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nNote about the auto-renewing premium subscription:\n— The auto-renewing subscription is available on yearly basis for USD $2.99\n— Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n— Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n— Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n— Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n— No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n— Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nIf you want to use HUD during a day-time — there is a special accessory HUDWAY Glass: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

All widgets work in regular or head-up display (HUD) mode. \n\nSpeedometers:\n— Classic digital speedometer\n— Digital, with compass, odometer, and distance traveled (Chevrolet Aveo style)\n— A set of retro speedometers: Cadillac style, arched, circular\n\nGPS trip information:\n— See how safely you drive: the app calculates your driving score based on your acceleration, braking, turns, and speeding data. \n— Know your fuel consumption per each trip and the expenses on it.\n— Information on your current, maximum and average speed, distance and time traveled\n— Large compass\n— Eco-driving. Acceleration and deceleration graphs indicate driving efficiency\n\nOther:\n— Internet Radio\n— Land meter. Indicates the angle of car slope or tilt — pitching and rolling\n— Weather and clock\n\nLaunch the app, select the widget, and place the smartphone close to the windshield (to use it in HUD mode, with the screen image reflected onto the windshield), or fix it in the mount. \n\nAttention!\n1. On a clear day, the device screen brightness is typically insufficient to give a decent reflection for HUD mode. In that situation, you can use the app in standard mode with the phone fixed with some mount, OR stay HUD using our HUDWAY Glass accessory (more at hudwayglass.com or see bellow). At night, in dusk, or in dull weather the reflection is normally well-discernible.\n\n2. Continuous use of geolocation services (GPS and GLONASS) may drain your device battery fast.\n\n3. When driving, make sure that your smartphone or tablet is well fixed in some mount or on some sticky pad, and doesn't prevent you from clearly seeing the road.\n\nHUDWAY Glass car accessory makes smartphone work as a head-up display in any car even in daytime. Removes doubling, offers sharp enlarged reflection image.\nLearn more: http://hudwayglass.com\n\nPrivacy Policy\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/privacy\n\nTerms of Use\nhttp://hudwayapp.com/en/terms/"

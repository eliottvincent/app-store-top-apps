When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

Its main local features  are similar to our XFirePlus app, which are:\n\n- Local browser for quick navigation.\n- Search intelligence. \n- Bookmark management.\n- Caching to optimize the web browsing. \n- Visual Tabs to find content for future reference.\n- Open as many tabs as you like without losing track of your open Web pages.\n- Access to a Firefox running in a remote machine. Your Ip address will never be tracked.\n\nBut be aware that CroPlus includes a remote connection to a Cloud system from which you will be able to run a Midori web browser. As such, it inherits all the Midori functionalities. It supports many of the most popular parts of the web, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify and Rdio."

      "label": "- No expensive 3G/4G data connection, wifi or internet connection required for voice turn-by-turn navigation. Save on your data usage. Turn your iPhone or iPad into a mobile GPS navigation device.\n- No map download required after initial map download. All maps contained in the app after you download the map bundle as a one off in app purchase.\n- No subscriptions or ongoing costs. Free to use after your initial purchase.\n\nA simple to use, detailed navigation app with spoken instructions in various languages designed specifically for the iPhone and iPad. With this app you no longer have to worry about finding your way to any destination. No need for paper maps. No matter where you are or where the journey takes you, the app can be used anywhere offline. \n\nTravelling? Great for visitors who need a GPS navigation device during their stay without having to spend lots of money on one. Save your data allocation and money as you enjoy street by street navigation without the need for any mobile data connection.\n\nThe app has both off-line and on-line searching. On-line searching requires an internet connection for the actual search and uses very little data. Once the destination has been selected all navigation is off-line and data free.\n\nNOTE - For navigation the app does require that your iPad has a SIM slot (3G/4G slot), as only these iPads have the full GPS capabilities and antennas. You do not need a SIM to be installed for the data free GPS navigation. A WiFi-only iPad does not contain the in-built GPS that a WiFi+Cellular (SIM slot) iPad does and we do not recommend this app for Wifi only iPads. If your iPad is Wifi only, then you will be able to view the entire Spain maps, however full navigation will not function. The app is suitable for all iPhones.\n\n• All map data stored on your iPhone or iPad - no download costs for mapping or navigation after initial map download\n• Full-fledged turn-by-turn voice navigation including street names\n• Local online search for a specific address or place, service and shop. 'Pizza' 'Library' or 'Hostptal'\n• Set your own speed warnings for in and out of town\n• Street sign displays\n• 3D-view, with user options for 2D view during navigation\n• Selectable Route Types - Car efficient, fastest, shortest, Pedestrian (options map turns to north facing or direction), Bike fastest, shortest and quietest\n• Options to avoid toll roads, ferries and highways\n• Automatic night and day mode\n• Up to three alternative routes to choose from\n• Optional setting of a waypoint for a place you want to visit along your route\n• Time remaining in journey, your actual speed and distance remaining\n• Supports landscape and portrait views\n\nRemember for safety sake - do not adjust the settings on this app while driving. The iPad version is perfect for the passenger ‘navigator’. Position your device safely, out of the way of airbags and not obstructing the drivers vision. You are responsible for ensuring the road is safe to travel on. We do not accept responsibility for errors generated by unreported road works or the weather. You assume total responsibility and risk for using this satellite navigation app. Please note that as with all navigation apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can decrease battery faster than normal.\n\nPlease be kind with us for your reviews and ratings and please email admin@outbacktouring.com.au for support or to bug report.

      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

In 2021, we all have phones, and now they can be our line of defense.\n\nBy choosing trusted people as your Guardians, and allowing them to see where you are, you can have peace of mind, and protection in case anything goes wrong.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Invite your friends & family to be your Guardians. Choose the people you trust to see your location when needed.\n- Share your GPS location privately. Only your Guardians will be able to see where you are and check on your safety.\n- Notify your Guardians immediately when you are feeling unsafe, using the Emergency Sharing feature\n- Setup forever sharing. You can choose to share your location permanently to certain trusted people.\n- Battery life, network strength and phone status can also be shared. This can be vital information for your Guardians and your safety."

On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

Readings with the filter on are more inert than those with the filter off though. THE FILTER MUST BE ON WHEN CYCLING, JOGGING OR WALKING.\n\n3. The G-meter. Get APPROXIMATE acceleration calculated based on your speed variation. Why use the GPS G-meter: no need to keep your iPhone in a fixed position or connect it to your vehicle’s computer system, which means speed readings can be taken discreetly, for example, during a test drive. Taking a number of readings compensates lesser accuracy. Acceleration is calculated only when the filter is off. Acceleration cannot be measured near tall buildings, in the mountains or woods.\n\n4. Large, well-lit digits\n\n5. HUD (the speed is displayed in the windscreen reflection at night time or in cloudy weather)\n\n6. Background mode. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n7. Speed and acceleration graphs\n\n8. Odometer\n\n9. Altimeter\n\n10. Time, journey duration, and current stop duration. The current stop duration will be reset after 20 seconds of motion.\n\n11. See tracks on the map\n\n12. Save tracks\n\n13. Compass\n\n14. Angle of incline (inclinometer)\n\n15. Aircraft descent/climb angle\n\n16. Get detailed stats for any part of your journey\n\n17. Export your journey to a KMZ or GPX file\n\n18. Export track statistics table to a CSV file\n\n19. Load and show your route (journey plan) on the map together with a track. To do this, create a route, using a special online service (such as GPX Editor - https://www.gpxeditor.co.uk/map, The online GPX file editor - https://gpx.studio/, Track drawing websites - https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Track_drawing_websites) on your desktop, and export it as a GPX (KML, CSV) file. The file name must begin with \"Route\". Using iTunes, transfer the file into the app (OR use the \"Files\" app). Following this, you will be able to select your route at the bottom of your track list. Now you can easily travel following your route line, even without loading a map.\n\n20. Export and import files via iTunes and email\n\n21. Waypoints (description, color selection, keywords, photos, audio records)\n\n22. A single waypoint database with a filter option\n\n23. Music controls\n\n24. No annoying ads\n\n25. Vintage design \n\n\nAudio alert settings:\n• \"60! 70!! 80!!!\": One audio signal once you go over 60, a continuous signal for over 70, and another continuous (and more unpleasant) signal for over 80.\n• \"60! 70\": Detailed cues, such as \"60! 70!!\".\n• \"50!! 55. 60!!\": Continuous signal within the speed range between 50 and 55, and continuous signal for over 60.\n• \"60!!! 60.\": One signal above 60.\n• You can enter a comment at the beginning of the line, for example, \"Highway 70!!!\".\n• Type in any word without numbers (for example, \"OFF\") and use if to turn off the speed control.\n• You can upload your own WAV file with the name of the signal (for example, \"!.wav\" or \"!!!.wav\") to play your own sound. Connect your iPhone to a computer, then go to iTunes > iPhone > \"File Sharing\" > Apps. Or use the \"Files\" app.\n\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\n1. When driving past tall buildings (or in the mountains or woods) with the filter off, the device may display false speed spikes (due to an unstable satellite signal). In this case, switching the filter on may be a better option.\n\n2. Car speedometers often display a higher than actual speed, the difference sometimes reaching 10%. This is due to your wheels’ diameter. This is why at high speeds GPS speedometers can deliver better accuracy than your regular car speedometer. And the higher the speed, the more accurate your GPS speedometer is.\n\n3. Please note that temporary false readings are possible with ANY GPS speedometer when you start using it.\n\n4. Battery life (iPhone 5S, poor light outside, 100% => 20%):\nBackground mode (iPhone asleep): ~ 9 h\nSpeedometer (speed, distance): ~ 4 h\nTrack-enabled map: ~ 2 h 30 min\n\nhttps://youtu.be/92TefSsz7gY"

Videos are live-streamed to the app and important events, like hard brakes and accidents, are immediately saved to your phone and backed up to your private Nexar cloud, so you can access evidence from any device, at any time.\n\nWhen you join Nexar, you’re also joining a community of drivers who care about safety and the drivers’ community. The Nexar app is constantly being upgraded and we’re committed to building a service that will improve your driving experience and eventually save lives.\n\nHOW DO I GET A NEXAR-POWERED DASH CAM?\nYou can order a dash cam right from the app or from buy.getnexar.com.\n\n---\n\nFEATURES\n\nRecords as you drive\nWhen paired to a compatible camera, Nexar starts recording automatically, whenever you start driving, and streams video to the app. The app works in the background so you can use other apps while driving.\n\nDetects dangerous incidents\nNexar uses AI algorithms and sensors to automatically capture dangerous incidents like hard brakes, sharp turns, and fast accelerations.\n\nProvides instant evidence\nIn case of an accident, the footage is automatically displayed on the Nexar app.\n\nBacks up to the cloud\nAll driving incidents are automatically uploaded to your free and secure Nexar cloud account.\n\n1-Click Report™  for insurance claims\nCreate detailed summaries of driving incidents, including place, time, impact, and footage, to save you time, money and unnecessary stress.\n\n360 Collision Detection\nNexar’s machine learning algorithms identify (and prove) all types of collisions, even when they occur beyond the camera’s frame.\n\nView & share your videos\nAfter every drive, you'll be able to see its summary, including the route and any incident clips that were recorded. Share these clips and other data with friends, family, or your insurance provider, directly through the app.\n\n---\n\n6 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW\nNexar saves what matters most. Your drives are saved to your phone based on available space. Dangerous incidents are automatically uploaded to your Nexar cloud, where they are never erased.\nNexar lets you control how much storage the app uses.\nThe dash cam connects to the app using its own WiFi signal. You’ll still be able to use your data plan.\nNexar won’t drain your data plan. The app uses data only after an incident was detected, to backup important evidence to your Nexar cloud account.\nYou can use Nexar to share your drives. Trim a driving clip and share it with your friends and family.\nYou own your data. We never share any individual’s data unless they authorize it.\n\n---\n\n24/7 SUPPORT\nNeed help?

      "label": "Get the most out of your rides by turning your smartphone into a motorbiking tool thanks to the BMW Motorrad Connected app.\r\n\nCreate your dream route using a series of waypoints or import routes as GPX files. The impressions and data you collect on your rides are automatically saved under your rides.\r\n\nSimply use Bluetooth to connect to your motorbike, which is equipped with Connectivity features and a TFT display, and, if available, establish a connection to your communication system. Whether you want a scenic, winding route or the fastest way from A to B, voice commands and the clear TFT display with arrows providing directions will guide you and your motorbike safely to your destination. Using the controls on the handlebar, the navigation, telephone and music features are at your fingertips at all times; you also have a continuous overview of the key data about your ride and your motorbike.\r\n\nKeep other riders up to date on your progress by sharing your routes, riding data and photos at the touch of a button with friends on social media or the Rever app.\r\n\r\nWe continuously develop our app for you – and we hope that you'll stay excited to discover its new functions. \r\nHere, you can find an overview of all the features the BMW Motorrad Connected app currently offers:\r\n\r\n#Route Planning.\r\n•\tPlan and save routes with waypoints\r\n•\tMotorbike-specific navigation with the \"winding route\" criteria\r\n•\tWeather information for your current location\r\n•\tImport and export routes (GPX files)\r\n•\tFree map downloads for offline use\r\n\r\n#Navigation.\r\n•\tMotorbike navigation suitable for every day\r\n•\tTFT display with arrow navigation (voice commands if a communication system is available)\r\n•\tLane recommendations\r\n•\tUp-to-date traffic information\r\n•\tSpeed limit display\r\n•\tPoint-of-interest search\r\n\r\n#Route Recording.\r\n•\tRecord travelled routes and vehicle data\r\n•\tAnalyse performance values such as banking angle, acceleration and engine speed\r\n•\tRoute export (GPX files)\r\n•\tShare recorded routes and photos on social media\r\n\r\n#Vehicle Data.\r\n•\tCurrent mileage\r\n•\tFuel level and remaining distance\r\n•\tTyre pressure(with RDC special equipment)\r\n•\tService requirements\r\n\r\nNotes for use.\r\n•\tThis app is part of BMW Motorrad Connectivity and can only actively be used when connected to a vehicle with a TFT display. The connection is established wirelessly between a smartphone, the vehicle and – if available – a communication system via Bluetooth; the app is operated using the multi-controller on the handlebar. We recommend using the BMW Motorrad communication system for listening to music, making telephone calls and receiving navigation instructions.\r\n•\tA mobile Internet connection is required to access traffic information. This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone. Please note that not all languages are supported.\r\n•\tContinued use of GPS tracking in the background may reduce the battery life of your smartphone.\r\nMake Life a Ride."

This feature sends an alert for breaking news within a few kilometres of your current location – just allow access to your location when prompted. This can be especially useful for alerts about traffic delays or accidents, fires, floods, and police operations.\n \nWe understand that too many alerts can be intrusive, so our team will only send ones we think you will find truly interesting. Our alerts are sent without an audible tone so you won't be disturbed at the wrong time.\n \nThe 9NEWS app also allows you to set your location by city or postcode so you see extra stories from your state and weather forecasts for exactly where you live.\n \nIf you feel you're getting too many alerts, or too few, you can easily change your subscriptions within the app on the Settings screen.\n \nHave questions or feedback on the 9NEWS app? Email contact@9news.com.au to let us know.\n\nPlease note: This app features Nielsen's proprietary measurement software which will allow you to contribute to market research or audience ratings services.

Think of reporters who see a big coin announcement, they have to write the article, check it out, and publish it. Instead we notify you directly of the official tweet in less than 1 minute from its creation!\n\nSET YOUR NOISE THRESHOLD\nOur proprietary algorithms rate each tweet based on how likely it is that it contains breaking news. Each user can easily set the minimum threshold a tweet must have to be notified.\n\nSUPPORTED ASSETS\nBitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Binance (BNB), Litecoin(LTC), Basic Attention Token (BAT), 0x, (ZRX) and USD Coin (USDC) and all the others.\n\nNEED MORE HELP?\nVisit beefore.me for information and to contact Beefore Support."

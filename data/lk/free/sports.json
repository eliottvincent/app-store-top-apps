Perfect Stopwatch Track & Field can be used for all types of sprints and is even more dynamic than a stopwatch because the accuracy is in the thousandths of a second.\n\nPerfect Stopwatch Track & Field uses video to determine the time of the sprint.

Watch the tutorial in the app to understand the simple process.\n\nRather than relying on a coach's thumb determining your sprint time, you can use the app to video record and time your run as many times as you want. If the coach messes up on a handheld time, you'll have to re-run, but what if that was your fastest run? Welp, now you'll never know. As long as you have a video of your run, Perfect Stopwatch Track & Field gives you the ability to time your run with perfect accuracy. \n\nBeing a former athlete not too long ago, I'm even shocked that this was possible.

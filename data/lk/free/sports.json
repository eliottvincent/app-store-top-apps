The stream is awesome, and the breaking news is dead on. So much better than trying to follow multiple teams on ESPN. NICE JOB FELLAS!” \n\n • “SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! - As soon as I got the app and added my local team, I got breaking news from my team before they broke the news on a local sports talk radio that I listen at work every day. From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

Create a game in the CricHQ app on a separate phone or tablet.\n3. Click on the 'Connect to Camera' icon in CricHQ and simply score.\n\nThe MAR Cam will then create video replays of all the important plays and tag them up with every piece of information about the ball - for example player who bowled, player who was batting, runs that were scored. These are available for you to view and share online at crichq.com or via the CricHQ app. \n\nEveryone can follow along and you have a history of all your best and memorable moments, you also have an amazing video analysis tool at your fingertips without any of the hassle that you normally require.\n\nYou can choose to auto upload replays as they are created, or turn the upload on later when you are back at home or the office. This is controlled with a simple set of controls in the settings menu. You can also choose which type of balls to capture and which not to.\n\nIf you are at a ground which has a wifi connection just make sure the MAR Cam phone or tablet and the CricHQ phone or tablet are connected to the wifi network. Even if there is no wifi available you can create a hotspot on one of the devices and join to it with the other one - just make sure that you get the owners permission for connecting to the hotspot as a significant amount of data can be used for uploading replays from a game."

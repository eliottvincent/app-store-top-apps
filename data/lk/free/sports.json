Everything you need to make sure you are accurately counting and scoring each ball.\n\n\nCricket Coaches\n\nInstall the latest cricket umpire over and ball counter to allow you to help coach your players to bat longer innings. The Total Dot Balls feature is a great tool to help encourage batsman to rotate the strike to keep the scoreboard ticking over.\n\n\nCricket Players\n\nAre you looking to get on the good side of your regular cricket umpire?

      "label": "The PVBatex cricket batting app trains your fitness and concentration to score big hundreds!\nIn a powerful move for the cricket coaching world, PitchVision - the leading cricket technology company - have purchased BATEX, cricket’s premier fitness app. The original BATEX app developed fitness in batsmen by adding realistic running to net sessions. Batsmen bat in a range of different ODI and T20  situations and run as they would in a game. The app controls the number of runs and the pace of running.\n \nPVBatex is fun & time efficient - you work on your fitness while doing what you love: batting in the nets! Audio commentary takes you through a simulated one-day hundred! As your fitness improves, make the in app purchases to unlock higher levels!\n***\n\nFlick through the '?' section to learn how to set up PVBatex in your net and watch demo videos. If you have any questions, suggestions or problems don't hesitate to contact PitchVision for help.\n\nIn PVBatex you bat with a partner and audio commentary tells you your field settings, score, what to run and sets the pace for your running between the wicket speed. It’s a bit like a beep test for cricket.\n\nYou may think you look pretty good batting in the nets for 10 minutes, but add some fitness pressure and your technique can come to pieces. PVBatex exists to address this problem.\n\nThere are four PVBatex levels each including: 6 stages that last 20 to 25 minutes: \n\nLevel 1 Junior, suitable for under 15s (The first 3 stages of this level are included. The last 3 stages can be unlocked through in-app purchase).\n\nLevel 2 Club (You can unlock this level through in-app purchase).\n\nLevel 3 Pro (You can unlock this level through in-app purchase).\n\nLevel 4 International (You can unlock this level through in-app purchase) \n\nEach level of PVBatex is made of six stages. If you fail to make your ground before the sound of the beep on three occasions during a stage you will have failed the test! \n\nEach of the six stages has a different flavour. For example, Stage 1 is called 'Opening up the Innings' and replicates the demands of test match cricket , whereas Stage 4 is called 'Powerplay' and reflects the swash-buckling demands of Twenty20 cricket. If you complete all 6-stages you will experience the fitness and concentration demands of a high-intensity one-day hundred!\n\nSport science research has demonstrated that PVBatex replicates the fitness demands of a high intensity, one-day hundred. Moreover, was used as the 'finishing school' for batsmen at The University of Western Australia. The PVBatex sessions are tough but it's a tried and tested method that trains you how to score big hundreds! Can you complete it?\nYou will get a lot out of the PVBatex app! Train well!"

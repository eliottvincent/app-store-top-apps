This app with real-time data analysis of soccer games around the globe makes you the omniscient god of soccer!\n\nHow much possession does the favored team have? Our statistics are up-to-date every second of the football game and help you to assess the game. \n\n- Bundled real-time statistics of a running game\n- New goal statistic after the last goal\n- Analysis and evaluation of live games in real time\n- Push notifications about hit calculations\n- Game schedules worldwide (today / tomorrow)\n- Management of favorite games\n- Multi-check for ongoing, active pushes\n- Overview of sent recommendations\n\nWith us you will get the decisive advantage in your circle of friends and secure the winning tip. We carry all relevant games worldwide and guarantee you 100% soccer fun every day, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.\n\nUpdate v2.6.0:\n\nForm table - selection of matches according to the form of the teams.\nFiltering of matches can now be done not only by match day (today or tomorrow), but also by teams' form. The results of the last 3 matches are displayed for each team (W/D/L = won/draw/lost). The games of the teams with the best form – therefore won the most games – appear at the top of the table.\n\nStatistics of the last 10/15/20 minutes\nBy clicking on the new statistics icon, statistics of the last 10, 15 or 20 minutes can be retrieved and displayed. This helps the user enormously to better assess the current development of a match.\n\nShow statistics since the last goal\nWhen pressing the soccer icon, the statistics since the last goal are displayed. All values except ball possession, yellow and red cards are reset. The feature has got a new animated design. You can now immediately see that you are in the other mode.\n\nPressure of teams is displayed even after the 79th minute of the game \nThe pressure exerted by a team is now displayed even after the 79th minute of the match. However, no recommendation is given anymore. The bar will be displayed in red.\n\nSearch in the live games\nUnder the live games it is now possible to search for teams or leagues. This saves valuable time.\n\nDetail view of a match now with the form of the teams \nUnder the team names the results of the last 5 matches are now displayed (W/D/L = won/draw/lost). This allows the user to better judge the form of each team.\n\nCancel subscription\nWe have added a description on how to cancel the subscription.\n\nApp Tutorial\nA new, clear presentation of all functions allows a detailed overview of all the unique and useful features of the 1X2LiveTip app.\n\nYou have suggestions or want to support us with the introduction of the app?

Bowling Ball Arsenal\n7. Notes\n8. Score Calculator\n9. Spare Names\n\n---\n\n1. Angles & Targeting\n\nPlan & visualize a shot from the start of your approach to your target, helping you become more accurate and consistent.⁠ Add overlays, such as entry angle, focal point, distance markers, and save favorite shots.\n\nVideo mode can apply all the above to previously recorded videos, or use camera more when practicing, with up to 30sec delay, for continuous action replay of every shot.\n\n---\n\n2. Axis Tilt & Rotation\n\nTake a photo or video of your ball with a PAP (Positive Axis Point) marker and position it in the guide for your approximate axis tilt and rotation.  Great for working on control & consistency.⁠\n\n---\n\n3. Ball Speed & RPM\n\nIn simple mode use the start/stop button to calculate ball speed in real time.Advanced mode can load in a video for more accuracy, and rev-rate calculation.⁠\n\n---\n\n4. Observation Trainer\n\nWhen we let go of the ball, many of us immediately look up to see the end result at the pins. We don't see the journey the ball takes to, and through, the pins, so don’t see differences between pocket hits that do and don’t carry. ⁠\n⁠\nPractice ANYWHERE with the Observation Trainer and learn to focus on four key points of every shot that give you the info you need to make better decisions and start striking more.\n\n---\n\n5. Pattern Library\n\nInstant access to details & diagrams of hundreds of oil patterns, or enter your own custom patterns. Load any pattern into Angles & Targeting to plot your shot directly over it and plan how you'll attack the lanes.\n\n---\n\n6. Bowling Ball Arsenal\n\nSearchable library of over 1,500 balls and a way to manage your own arsenal. Organise balls into separate bags and keep track of information such as surface, layout, important dates and more. When looking for something new, use the Ball Library to find exactly what you want, with filters for brand, cover & core types, RG, Diff and more.\n\n---\n\n7. Notes\n\nKeep track of information about your game and equipment. Create general notes, or add notes from within most of the other tools, such as for oil patterns, your bowling balls, Speed & RPM readings, Observation Trainer scores and more.\n\n---\n\n8. Score Calculator\n\nWhether earning how scoring works, teaching youth bowlers how to score, or just giving your brain a rest at a Triple-X fun night, there's lots of reasons the Score Calculator can come in handy!\n\n---\n\n9. Spare Names\n\nJust for fun, tap the pins to see nicknames of common spares you probably don’t want to be leaving!\n\n---\n\n\n\"Every bowler should have Tenpin Toolkit on every device they own.  It’s an incredible information source and provides so many things to help you learn, get better and challenge yourself.\"\n\nTim Mack\nUSBC Hall of Famer & Storm Director of Global Relations\n\n---\n\n\"A brilliant app with tools to help you develop and learn different skills. The observation trainer is a great way to train your eyes to start watching your ball go down the lane\"\n\nVerity Crawley\nPWBA Professional & SCAD Team Coach\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\nPremium features can be unlocked with an in-app subscription.

That's the number of outcomes possible for the league matches for Cricket World Cup 2015, excluding Ties or No-Results!\n\nThen there are runs scored and wickets taken by both teams for each match. And one star performer out of 22 gets the Man of the Match award. The Man of the Tournament is even tougher odds: 1 out of 224!\n\nHow would you like to bet for outcomes of each matches, to see how you fare against others? Simply select any scheduled match, bet on the outcome, runs, wickets and man-of-match awards. When each match is over, you can see your score, as well as scores for other players of CricBet.\n\nInstead of using boring, real-world currency, you win points based on the accuracy of your predictions. Your score is tracked within Apple's Game Center, and you are ranked against a worldwide fanbase. All you need is a good knowledge of which teams are hot, which players are in form, and a hunch for what the scorecard would look like. Instead of sending messages or posting on Facebook, bet on CricBet and then share how accurate your predictions were. Good, clean fun, no match fixing required!\n\nTies (both teams scoring same number of runs) and upsets (when a lower-ranked team defeats a higher-ranked team) get you more points, and latter stages increase the points too. \n\nSo start playing now! All the best to you & your team!"

From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

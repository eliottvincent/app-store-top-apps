Intended for responsible use in a motorsports environment. Use at your own risk.\n\nWorks on iPhone and compatible GPS-enabled iPad, iPad mini, and iPod touch devices. Devices which do not contain suitable GPS hardware may work when combined with a compatible external GPS device. Performance depends on good GPS reception conditions, and may vary. Features, capabilities, and pricing may differ between platforms and are subject to change at any time.\n\nOBD functionality is optional, and would require a supported OBD-II interface device and a compatible OBD-II compliant vehicle. See website for details.\n\nFeatures and capabilities can vary depending on your device and other circumstances.\n\nUse of Live Streaming feature is optional and requires a premium upgrade. Services are provided as-is, and are subject to change or discontinuation at any time. This functionality does have privacy implications. Please see this app's online documentation and http://Live.RaceRender.com before enabling its use. Use of Live Streaming service requires an Internet connection, and is therefore subject to your wireless carrier and/or Internet provider's data rates.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

That's the number of outcomes possible for the league matches for Cricket World Cup 2015, excluding Ties or No-Results!\n\nThen there are runs scored and wickets taken by both teams for each match. And one star performer out of 22 gets the Man of the Match award. The Man of the Tournament is even tougher odds: 1 out of 224!\n\nHow would you like to bet for outcomes of each matches, to see how you fare against others? Simply select any scheduled match, bet on the outcome, runs, wickets and man-of-match awards. When each match is over, you can see your score, as well as scores for other players of CricBet.\n\nInstead of using boring, real-world currency, you win points based on the accuracy of your predictions. Your score is tracked within Apple's Game Center, and you are ranked against a worldwide fanbase. All you need is a good knowledge of which teams are hot, which players are in form, and a hunch for what the scorecard would look like. Instead of sending messages or posting on Facebook, bet on CricBet and then share how accurate your predictions were. Good, clean fun, no match fixing required!\n\nTies (both teams scoring same number of runs) and upsets (when a lower-ranked team defeats a higher-ranked team) get you more points, and latter stages increase the points too. \n\nSo start playing now! All the best to you & your team!"

Athletes have the ability to post their film on a feed for all users to see. These posts are sharable, which helps athletes gain the exposure needed to gain the attention of coaches and scouts at the next level. Users can also easily message one another by simply visiting another user’s profile page and then directly sending a message. \n\nAnother benefit of this app is a page focused on discovering schools. Users are able to view conferences and schools from NCAA divisions 1, 2, and 3. This feature will help athletes and their families discover schools that they may have not been aware of before. This page of the app also includes a section dedicated to NCAA eligibility. Important information regarding eligibility is available to all users of the app. This was created with the intent of simplifying the process that  athletes must go through in order to compete at the college level."

It’s the personal basketball trainer that’s always with you, capturing your performance, your stats, and your progress—guiding you to the next level. With HomeCourt, every rep counts. \n\nTRAIN SMARTER\nHomeCourt captures your moves and your stats as you train—so you can see your true skill level. HomeCourt uses the camera on your device to track your performance in real-time, everything from your jump shot to your crossover. In-depth data and analytics help you break down every session. HomeCourt calculates metrics like shooting percentage, accuracy, release time, dribble speed, vertical jump and more. You can even use Apple Watch to track your heart rate and save your data to HealthKit. \n\nENGAGE IN FUN, INTERACTIVE DRILLS\nUsing HomeCourt is less like training and more like a video game.

You can join a virtual Team on HomeCourt, or create your own Team for free. You can also challenge a friend or teammate to any HomeCourt activity with a time-shifted “Battle Mode” that matches you up head-to-head. As you compete in Battles, you collect trophies, badges, and coins, just like you would in a video game. Earn rewards and level up together.\n\nSHOWCASE YOUR SKILLS\nEngage in unique showcase activities and even get discovered directly by the NBA. Participants who opt-in to NBA Global Scout are eligible to receive invitations to select NBA tryouts, camps, tournaments, and showcases. As you build your profile on HomeCourt, you can also share your progress with individual coaches and scouts.\n\n--\nSET UP\nHomeCourt is ready to use everywhere you bring your iPhone or iPad. No special basketballs, uncomfortable sensors, or expensive equipment is required. Just set up your phone with a clear view of the court and starting training and competing through HomeCourt.\n\nPRICING\n• Free: Access the full library of 100+ drills and activities. Get unlimited shot tracking.\n• HomeCourt Plus: Access your full workout history, get complete skill ratings, join the members-only training club, request feedback from HomeCourt pro trainers, participate in HomeCourt Global Camp, and create up to 4 user profiles.\n\nHomeCourt Plus is available for subscription as either monthly or yearly auto-renewable subscriptions. Payment will be charged to your App Store account upon the expiration of the free trial period. Subscription automatically renews unless the subscription is canceled or auto-renew turned off at least 24 hours before the expiration of the free trial period or the current subscription period.

Devices which do not contain suitable GPS hardware may work when combined with a compatible external GPS device. Performance depends on good GPS reception conditions, and may vary. Features, capabilities, and pricing may differ between platforms and are subject to change at any time.\n\nOBD functionality is optional, and would require a supported OBD-II interface device and a compatible OBD-II compliant vehicle. See website for details.\n\nFeatures and capabilities can vary depending on your device and other circumstances.\n\nUse of Live Streaming feature is optional and requires a premium upgrade. Services are provided as-is, and are subject to change or discontinuation at any time. This functionality does have privacy implications. Please see this app's online documentation and http://Live.RaceRender.com before enabling its use. Use of Live Streaming service requires an Internet connection, and is therefore subject to your wireless carrier and/or Internet provider's data rates.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

It adjusts your handicap at the end of each day’s play to ensure you’re always playing at the edge of your ability. \n\nEvery shot you play is instantly analysed and scored it against your personal handicap using our unique ‘Strokes Gained’ analysis so you can tailor your practice routine to bridge the gap between the golfer you are - and the golfer you want to be. \n\nCLUB AND SHOT DATA, SAFELY STORED FOR ANALYSIS\n\nInrange reveals what the ball is doing - and why it’s doing it - so you can start working on the areas of your golf game that matter. Inrange ensures you’re practicing smarter, not harder. \n\nAccess instant and historical ball flight data and shot data in an intuitive interface that work seamlessly on your iOS device: \n\n∙ Inrange Handicap™\n∙ accuracy\n∙ ball speed\n∙ ball trajectory\n∙ carry distance\n∙ performance by target and club\n∙ launch angle\n∙ shot dispersion\n∙ shot grouping\n∙ session data\n\nFilter and review your stats right there on the range so you can gain the insights you need. \n\nINSTANT FEEDBACK ON EVERY SHOT\n\nWith its live shot data, Inrange enables you to identify exactly what’s going on with your game, as it’s happening. \n\nView your shot stats on both iPhone and iPad and even compete with other players around you.

From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams.

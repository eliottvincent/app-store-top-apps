With Flashscore, you won't miss a single goal ever again. Just select your favourite matches, teams or players, and our notifications will then let you know about every important moment of the match.\n\n\nSPORTS SCORES, FAST AND ACCURATE\n\n• GREAT COVERAGE: You can find football, tennis, basketball, hockey, rugby and 33 other sports in our app. We cover 6000+ competitions from all around the world - you can follow 1200+ football competitions alone!\n• SPEED: Whether a goal is scored, red card issued, set or period is over, you will know at the same time as the live audience.\n\n\nNO MORE MISSED MATCHES OR UPDATES\n\n• FAVOURITE TEAMS AND MATCHES: Don’t waste your time, and follow only your favourite matches, teams and competitions.\n• NOTIFICATIONS AND ALERTS: Match starts, line-ups, goals - you will not miss any of it again. Just select your favourite matches and wait for your mobile device to let you know.\n• STAYING IN SYNC: Do you like to switch between your computer, mobile and tablet? We are prepared for this: as a registered user you will see all of your personalized data across all your devices.\n\n\nTABLES AND MATCH DETAILS\n\n• LIVE COMMENTARY: Unable to watch the match on TV? No problem: stay up-to-date with our detailed live text commentary.\n• LINE-UPS AND HEAD-TO-HEAD: Do you need to know the line-ups before the match starts? We have them in advance. And also the head-to-head history so you can check how both teams have played against each other in the past.\n• LIVE TABLES: One goal can change a lot. Our live tables will show you if a scored goal has changed the league ranking, as well as the current top scorers table.\n• MATCH PREVIEWS AND RECAPS: Stats are important, but they don't tell everything. This is why you can find a detailed preview for every match in the most popular leagues - and also the post-match reports.\n\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES\n\nLength of this subscription is 1 year.

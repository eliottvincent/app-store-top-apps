It features a nice plain design, with no unnecessary controls. \n\nAdjust Number of Sets, Action and Break duration to your needs and you are ready to go!\n\nOn the iOS an extra switch control allows you to prevent the screen from dimming.\n\nSIT remembers the last 5 configurations you have used. Swipe left across the Settings screen to switch to another configuration.\n\nSIT can run in the background, while you are playing music, watching videos or doing anything else on your iOS device.\n\nSIT Watch features the same simplicity as the iOS app while offering the same functionality, plus it will measure your heartbeat during the workout sessions. The recordings will be available in the Apple's Health app.\n\nSIT Watch runs independently of the phone, so no need to have your phone around during your workouts (although you will need your phone during the very first time you launch SIT watch).\n\nSIT lets you avoid any tedious set up and focus on your training!"

Contains a lot of widgets that you can put on your home screen to track your matches, frames, breaks, and much more.\n\nHere is what some players are saying about SnookerCoach:\n\n**** So much easier than writing my matches out by hand and working out the percentages for my stats. It's the best app for snooker practice\n\n**** It's great that you can enter your match and frame scores in the app. This motivates me to win the next time I encounter the same player.\n\n**** I am a beginning snooker player. The practice routines in Snooker Coach 147 motivated me to practice more and I do many different routines now, instead of always playing the same line-up.\n\n**** I used to go to my local club to 'knock some balls around' as practice. Snooker Coach 147 has helped me to practice more focused to complete each routine successfully. I am winning more matches and playing with more confidence."

On the other hand you want to see match statistics, what the shooting percentage was, and shooting rates for both GS and GA separately either during the match or at the end.\n\nNetScore allows to to achieve all of this while still enjoying the match.\n\nYou can set the tournament and team names, save and retrieve previous matches, and share your results with others. You can optionally keep track of non-scoring events (such as interceptions and rebounds) by position and named player so you can see the effectiveness of your whole team. You can pre-load a series of matches (a whole tournament, for example), then recall them when you're ready to start and there's not much time between matches. You can even change the colour scheme to suit you."

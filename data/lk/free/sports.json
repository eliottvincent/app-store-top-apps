      "label": "\"This is the best football stats app on the market, one that sets a new bar for this genre of apps, and an essential one for all football fans to download.\" - 6 Best Apps for Football Statistics, Ross Armstrong, TurboFuture\n\nFinding the stats needed for football betting is time consuming and often not possible. As a result, this puts the bookmakers at a significant advantage.\n\nEFS was developed to provide detailed stats of how teams have performed in key betting markets. The app will help to reduce the advantage and give you an improved chance of betting successfully. \n\nThere are a small number of leagues available in full, for all users, to give a sample of the opportunities and benefits that come with a full subscription. \n\nThe key benefits of the EFS app with a subscription are:\n\n* Detailed football stats & predictions\n\nThe app provides statistics and predictions for each game in a clear layout, covering all the key betting markets. These include:\n\n- Full Time Result, \n- Both Teams to Score (BTTS), \n- Result and BTTS, \n- Team Goals, Corners and Cards,\n- Match Goals, Corners and Cards, and many more\n\nIn addition, there is a full analysis of the league table, recent results and predictions and expected goals (xG) for each game. \n\n* Predictions and Value Bets\n\nThe app includes statistical predictions of the outcomes in the key betting markets. The predictions are a good starting point to research a game. \n\nThe app identifies value bets, where the price offered by the bookmaker is in excess of the fair odds. This allows you to find value and profitable lines. \n\n* Expected Goals (xG) Stats\n\nExpected goals figures are available for each game covered by the app. This allows a view in the flow of the game, and analysis of which teams are performing well without getting the results their play deserves.  \n\n* Fully Customisable Stats\n\nFootball accumulators and bets are often made on a hunch or a gut instinct. These are often biased and will favour the bookmaker. \n\nWithin EFS, you can customise all stats for any period. This period can cover a set number of matches, or a particular time frame. For a further level of analysis and detail, you can filter the stats for home or away matches, or all matches.\n\nThis information means you can build accumulators and place based on substance. These bets will have an increased chance of success.\n\n* In-depth Team Stats\n\nEach team has their own personal page, showing upcoming fixtures and previous results. Also included is an analysis of how each team has performed in the main betting markets, against the league averages. \n\n* In-depth League Analysis\n\nAll league tables are fully customisable, for home or away matches only, or for all matches. In addition, you can customise the league table for dates, to give an exclusive look at recent form. \n\nFurthermore, there is a full analysis of the league's result stats, goal stats and expected goals stats to allows you to spot current trends within the league.\n\nRegardless of whether you are a casual or expert football fan, there is a wealth of knowledge on the app waiting to be explored. Download, subscribe and find your edge today!\n\nThe Terms of Use (EULA) for the app can be found on the following link - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula\n\nWe hope you enjoy the app and we would love to hear from you. If you are enjoying the app, we would be grateful if you would leave us a positive review. If you have any technical issues or suggestions for new features, then please email the team on info@edgefootballstats.com."

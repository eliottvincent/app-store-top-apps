That's the number of outcomes possible for the league matches for Cricket World Cup 2015, excluding Ties or No-Results!\n\nThen there are runs scored and wickets taken by both teams for each match. And one star performer out of 22 gets the Man of the Match award. The Man of the Tournament is even tougher odds: 1 out of 224!\n\nHow would you like to bet for outcomes of each matches, to see how you fare against others? Simply select any scheduled match, bet on the outcome, runs, wickets and man-of-match awards. When each match is over, you can see your score, as well as scores for other players of CricBet.\n\nInstead of using boring, real-world currency, you win points based on the accuracy of your predictions. Your score is tracked within Apple's Game Center, and you are ranked against a worldwide fanbase. All you need is a good knowledge of which teams are hot, which players are in form, and a hunch for what the scorecard would look like. Instead of sending messages or posting on Facebook, bet on CricBet and then share how accurate your predictions were. Good, clean fun, no match fixing required!\n\nTies (both teams scoring same number of runs) and upsets (when a lower-ranked team defeats a higher-ranked team) get you more points, and latter stages increase the points too. \n\nSo start playing now! All the best to you & your team!"

      "label": "Our passionate team of football experts likes to think outside the box. We took our imagination to the next level and created Tipstero Analyser with Artificial Intelligence, a new algorithm based on artificial intelligence designed to analyze all the matches smarter and faster. Based on our past experience we integrated some basic criteria into the new algorithm and the results are amazing, just try it and you'll see.\n\nWe used all our resources to find a prediction algorithm based on artificial intelligence and we succeeded. We integrated basic criteria and the computer analyzer can predict and estimate the most likely outcomes for the top markets 1x2, double chance, over / under, BTTS / GG. The algorithm calculates all the probabilities and offers the winning percentages based on past statistic data, team form, head to head results, goals scored, goals conceded, odds fluctuation, team profile (attacking or defending), past playing formulas. Although the algorithm has been tested and proved to be a viable long term option if used wisely, you must consider that it can only estimate the percentages for the most likely outcome based on statistic data... the algorithm doesn't have access to all available data like injured players, weather conditions, team motivation or individual player motivation. In conclusion, our artificial intelligence analyzer can help you spear a lot of time by posting the most likely outcomes for all markets, just pass the info you get through your personal filter to get the best of it.\n\n\nBASIC FEATURES\n\n• Estimates and predictions 3 days in advance - accurate daily football betting tips for each match generated with our artificial intelligence algorithm\n\n• History - past 3 days available (all betting tips included)\n\n• Prediction Types - 1x2, Double Chance, Over / Under, BTTS / GG\n\n• Dictionary (betting tips) - all betting tips explained in detail\n\n• Professional design - friendly and easy to use\n\n• Push Notification  - with on / off option\n\n• Customized match hours - according to your phone's time zone\n\n\n\nADVANCED FEATURES\n\n• Win Rate Percentage - a trust indicator used to rank the predictions according to the trust level assigned by the AI Algorithm \n\n• Full Customization - you can add favorite leagues, expand and collapse leagues visibility and to use the filters to sort matches by leagues or by start hour \n\n• Auto Bet (Ticket Generator) - The ultimate auto ticket creator that allows you to generate virtual bets with a high probability.

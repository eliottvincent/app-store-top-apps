      "label": "The Cricket Scorebook App takes a simple approach to scoring cricket. Not only that, we have features that help with coaching and improving player performance.\n\nFeatures for Coaches:\n* Dot ball counter - encourage kids and junior cricketers to rotate the strike to keep the scoreboard ticking\n* Most common dismissals for each batter. You can analyse each batter and find the common dismissal type - i.e. you might find a batter is always caught-out. You can then coach them techniques to reduce the ball being hit the air.\n* and many more coach analysis tools including total wides bowled, total strike rate, etc\n\nFeatures for Scorers:\n* Do you sometimes forget to score a ball? We have a smart reminder system that will vibrate your phone if you forget to score a ball. Never forget to score a ball again!\n* Ability to score negative runs instead of a wicket (perfect for kids cricket!)\n* Ability to score a wide and NOT count as an extra ball in the over (perfect for kids cricket!)\n* and many more features to make score easy - including allowing a batter to bat twice in one innings, undo a wrong score, etc\n\nStats include:\nBatting Average\nHighest Score\nTotal Runs\nStrike Rate\nTotal Innings Batted\nTotal Outs\nTotal Sixes\nTotal Fours\nTotal Dots\nTotal Balls faced\nTotal times dismissed bowled\nTotal times dismissed caught\nand MANY MORE STATS!!\n\n\nExciting 'fresh' design.\nEvery cricket scorebook looks the same. Not true! We have designed our app differently! \n\nNo longer is the design boring. Instead of showing the batter list while you score, we show coaching suggestions, live stats, current partnership, total innings dot-balls/scoring shots, and other helpful cricket tips.\n\nWho is this app for?\n\nIf you are scoring or coaching kids cricket, youth cricket, social cricket, indoor cricket, gully cricket or backyard cricket - this app is for you. It keeps things simple, makes scoring fun, and is completely FREE (in-app purchase available for stats).\n\nWho is this app not for?\n\nIf you are a senior cricketer, or play in a competitive grade - we suggest looking at an app that is built specifically for enhanced scoring & statistics (note: another advantage of our app is that it is free! Other enhanced Cricket scoring apps do have a cost).\n\nDownload today!\nThis app is built for ease-of-use for kids, youth & social cricket. And for coaches who want live in-play suggestions to help improve batting & bowling.\n\nThere has never been a Cricket Scorebook App built for Kids, Youth or social cricket… until this one launched! Download for FREE today.\n\nThis app has been developed by cricketers, cricket coaches, kids cricket scorers and kid cricket umpires. Made for all cricketers, by cricketers!\n\nWe don't like cricket, we love it!\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Now all you need to do is workout if the ball was pitching outside leg stump...\n\n\nHighest partnership\n\nAllow the app to assist with coaching by viewing the highest partnership, average partnership and current partnership. With this info you can encourage the batsman to bat a long innings to build large partnerships.\n\n\nCricket Umpires\n\nTime to update to the latest cricket umpire run counter. Everything you need to make sure you are accurately counting and scoring each ball.\n\n\nCricket Coaches\n\nInstall the latest cricket umpire over and ball counter to allow you to help coach your players to bat longer innings. The Total Dot Balls feature is a great tool to help encourage batsman to rotate the strike to keep the scoreboard ticking over.\n\n\nCricket Players\n\nAre you looking to get on the good side of your regular cricket umpire?

So it happens often, that the student forgets the next step in the middle of the kata form.\n\n„If I only had the chance to look the sequence up real quick, then I would master it pretty soon again.“\n\nEven prospects and beginners can easily follow the kata sequences because of many illustrations.\n\nThis App is supposed to be nothing else, than the required support and even more:\n• Which kata did I study last ? The list with the kata forms is build as a to-do-list. Depending on your progress, you can hook a kata off to change its order for a better overview. \n•The portrait mode allows you to recognize and study important details, since illustrations are bigger.\n• Illustrations can be zoomed in.\n• Two final techniques are always bound with three movements inbetween. Thus you can exactly follow how to get from one technique to another.\n• 3 different animation speeds and free scrolling allow you to adjust the app to the individual learning progress.\n• Landscape mode offers you a view of multiple graphics at one time to be able to better follow the sequences.\n• Eight freely eligible backgrounds put you in the right training mood.\n• Always available legend allows you to look up the symbols really fast.\n\nThis App contains 3 Shôtôkan-Kata:\n\nTaikyoku shodan\nHeian shodan\nHeian nidan\n\nThe upgrade to \"ShotokanPro\" contains additional 24 Shôtôkan-Kata:\n\nHeian sandan\nHeian yondan\nHeian godan\nTekki shodan\nTekki nidan\nTekki sandan\nBassai dai\nBassai shô\nKankû dai\nKankû shô\nEmpi\nHangetsu\nJion\nJitte\nJi’in\nChinte\nGankaku\nNijû shi ho\nSôchin\nWankan\nMeikyô\nGojû shi ho dai\nGojû shi ho shô\nUnsu\n\n\nWe wish you a lot of fun at practicing and hope that we could support you a little bit !\n\nAvailable in german, english, french, italian and spanish."

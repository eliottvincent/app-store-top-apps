      "label": "CricScore is a free, simple cricket scoring app without any ads or subscription fees required. CricScore’s unique features provide a smooth and pleasant user experience.  \n\nKey Features:\n-\tFree app, no ads present, no subscription required\n-\tThe opponent team does not need to use this app for you to score your batting innings\n-\tCreate teams without requiring an email address/phone number of each team member\n-\tAdd all the team members in a single click\n-\tPrivate PIN for each team to avoid random teams playing against your team\n-\tShowing the next spell bowler at the top at the end of the over\n-\tTemporarily skip sign-in and connect your email address later.\n\nCricScore app allows you to create a team efficiently add all team members in one attempt, which saves time by avoiding adding each team member individually.\n\nYour opponent team does not need to use this app for you to score your batting innings as there is an option to play against a sample team (created by CricScore). You can play against any opponent in the world as long as you have their team name and their team’s private PIN. Each team's private PIN prevents other teams from scoring against your team without your knowledge. Each team can update scoring from their mobiles without sharing the same account – changes will be live and available on each individual’s respective mobiles.\n\nWhile choosing the next bowler to bowl, CricScore shows the next spell bowler who can potentially continue at the top. CricScore also shows every other bowlers’ stats while choosing the next bowler to bowl. \n\nCricScore needs only the email address of the team’s administrator to create an account to sign in to the app. CricScore does not require other team members' phone numbers/email addresses to create a team.\n\nThere is an option for users to sign in anonymously without an email. Later, an email can be linked to the anonymous account. The anonymous user can still use all the signed-in user's features. However, CricScore does not recommend this option as the user will lose all their team's information, scores, and other data when they delete the app from their phone.\n\nCricscore’s founder created this app single-handedly in his free time to help cricket lovers everywhere enjoy the game more. Please let us know your feedback and suggestions by emailing support@cricscore.net."

Create a game in the CricHQ app on a separate phone or tablet.\n3. Click on the 'Connect to Camera' icon in CricHQ and simply score.\n\nThe MAR Cam will then create video replays of all the important plays and tag them up with every piece of information about the ball - for example player who bowled, player who was batting, runs that were scored. These are available for you to view and share online at crichq.com or via the CricHQ app. \n\nEveryone can follow along and you have a history of all your best and memorable moments, you also have an amazing video analysis tool at your fingertips without any of the hassle that you normally require.\n\nYou can choose to auto upload replays as they are created, or turn the upload on later when you are back at home or the office. This is controlled with a simple set of controls in the settings menu. You can also choose which type of balls to capture and which not to.\n\nIf you are at a ground which has a wifi connection just make sure the MAR Cam phone or tablet and the CricHQ phone or tablet are connected to the wifi network. Even if there is no wifi available you can create a hotspot on one of the devices and join to it with the other one - just make sure that you get the owners permission for connecting to the hotspot as a significant amount of data can be used for uploading replays from a game."

Devices which do not contain suitable GPS hardware may work when combined with a compatible external GPS device. Performance depends on good GPS reception conditions, and may vary. Features, capabilities, and pricing may differ between platforms and are subject to change at any time.\n\nOBD functionality is optional, and would require a supported OBD-II interface device and a compatible OBD-II compliant vehicle. See website for details.\n\nFeatures and capabilities can vary depending on your device and other circumstances.\n\nUse of Live Streaming feature is optional and requires a premium upgrade. Services are provided as-is, and are subject to change or discontinuation at any time. This functionality does have privacy implications. Please see this app's online documentation and http://Live.RaceRender.com before enabling its use. Use of Live Streaming service requires an Internet connection, and is therefore subject to your wireless carrier and/or Internet provider's data rates.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

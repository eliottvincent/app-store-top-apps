      "label": "The Cricket Scorebook App takes a simple approach to scoring cricket. Not only that, we have features that help with coaching and improving player performance.\n\nFeatures for Coaches:\n* Dot ball counter - encourage kids and junior cricketers to rotate the strike to keep the scoreboard ticking\n* Most common dismissals for each batter. You can analyse each batter and find the common dismissal type - i.e. you might find a batter is always caught-out. You can then coach them techniques to reduce the ball being hit the air.\n* and many more coach analysis tools including total wides bowled, total strike rate, etc\n\nFeatures for Scorers:\n* Do you sometimes forget to score a ball? We have a smart reminder system that will vibrate your phone if you forget to score a ball. Never forget to score a ball again!\n* Ability to score negative runs instead of a wicket (perfect for kids cricket!)\n* Ability to score a wide and NOT count as an extra ball in the over (perfect for kids cricket!)\n* and many more features to make score easy - including allowing a batter to bat twice in one innings, undo a wrong score, etc\n\nStats include:\nBatting Average\nHighest Score\nTotal Runs\nStrike Rate\nTotal Innings Batted\nTotal Outs\nTotal Sixes\nTotal Fours\nTotal Dots\nTotal Balls faced\nTotal times dismissed bowled\nTotal times dismissed caught\nand MANY MORE STATS!!\n\n\nExciting 'fresh' design.\nEvery cricket scorebook looks the same. Not true! We have designed our app differently! \n\nNo longer is the design boring. Instead of showing the batter list while you score, we show coaching suggestions, live stats, current partnership, total innings dot-balls/scoring shots, and other helpful cricket tips.\n\nWho is this app for?\n\nIf you are scoring or coaching kids cricket, youth cricket, social cricket, indoor cricket, gully cricket or backyard cricket - this app is for you. It keeps things simple, makes scoring fun, and is completely FREE (in-app purchase available for stats).\n\nWho is this app not for?\n\nIf you are a senior cricketer, or play in a competitive grade - we suggest looking at an app that is built specifically for enhanced scoring & statistics (note: another advantage of our app is that it is free! Other enhanced Cricket scoring apps do have a cost).\n\nDownload today!\nThis app is built for ease-of-use for kids, youth & social cricket. And for coaches who want live in-play suggestions to help improve batting & bowling.\n\nThere has never been a Cricket Scorebook App built for Kids, Youth or social cricket… until this one launched! Download for FREE today.\n\nThis app has been developed by cricketers, cricket coaches, kids cricket scorers and kid cricket umpires. Made for all cricketers, by cricketers!\n\nWe don't like cricket, we love it!\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

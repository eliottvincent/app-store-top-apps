Bowling Ball Arsenal\n7. Notes\n8. Score Calculator\n9. Spare Names\n\n---\n\n1. Angles & Targeting\n\nPlan & visualize a shot from the start of your approach to your target, helping you become more accurate and consistent.⁠ Add overlays, such as entry angle, focal point, distance markers, and save favorite shots.\n\nVideo mode can apply all the above to previously recorded videos, or use camera more when practicing, with up to 30sec delay, for continuous action replay of every shot.\n\n---\n\n2. Axis Tilt & Rotation\n\nTake a photo or video of your ball with a PAP (Positive Axis Point) marker and position it in the guide for your approximate axis tilt and rotation.  Great for working on control & consistency.⁠\n\n---\n\n3. Ball Speed & RPM\n\nIn simple mode use the start/stop button to calculate ball speed in real time.Advanced mode can load in a video for more accuracy, and rev-rate calculation.⁠\n\n---\n\n4. Observation Trainer\n\nWhen we let go of the ball, many of us immediately look up to see the end result at the pins. We don't see the journey the ball takes to, and through, the pins, so don’t see differences between pocket hits that do and don’t carry. ⁠\n⁠\nPractice ANYWHERE with the Observation Trainer and learn to focus on four key points of every shot that give you the info you need to make better decisions and start striking more.\n\n---\n\n5. Pattern Library\n\nInstant access to details & diagrams of hundreds of oil patterns, or enter your own custom patterns. Load any pattern into Angles & Targeting to plot your shot directly over it and plan how you'll attack the lanes.\n\n---\n\n6. Bowling Ball Arsenal\n\nSearchable library of over 1,500 balls and a way to manage your own arsenal. Organise balls into separate bags and keep track of information such as surface, layout, important dates and more. When looking for something new, use the Ball Library to find exactly what you want, with filters for brand, cover & core types, RG, Diff and more.\n\n---\n\n7. Notes\n\nKeep track of information about your game and equipment. Create general notes, or add notes from within most of the other tools, such as for oil patterns, your bowling balls, Speed & RPM readings, Observation Trainer scores and more.\n\n---\n\n8. Score Calculator\n\nWhether earning how scoring works, teaching youth bowlers how to score, or just giving your brain a rest at a Triple-X fun night, there's lots of reasons the Score Calculator can come in handy!\n\n---\n\n9. Spare Names\n\nJust for fun, tap the pins to see nicknames of common spares you probably don’t want to be leaving!\n\n---\n\n\n\"Every bowler should have Tenpin Toolkit on every device they own.  It’s an incredible information source and provides so many things to help you learn, get better and challenge yourself.\"\n\nTim Mack\nUSBC Hall of Famer & Storm Director of Global Relations\n\n---\n\n\"A brilliant app with tools to help you develop and learn different skills. The observation trainer is a great way to train your eyes to start watching your ball go down the lane\"\n\nVerity Crawley\nPWBA Professional & SCAD Team Coach\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\nPremium features can be unlocked with an in-app subscription.

      "label": "SportMember is a free sports app that functions as a member system for the coaches, players, parents as well as a tool for the club, that organises activities in the team calendar, membership payments, and general communication internally on a team and/or in a club. \n\n\nDo as more than a million others do, and put your entire club online with Denmark's best members system for sports. SportMember is developed for the purpose of making the everyday tasks more effective for the club - whether you’re designing the tactics, billing membership invoices, washing the dirty kit laundry or just responsible for attending activities. With SportMember you sign up for an activity in it’s calendar, hereafter the coach, member and parent will always be able to see, how many and which members are attending the next match or practice. Hereafter you will receive automatic notifications on your smartphone before the activity, so that the coach doesn‘t need to remind his/her members of the activity. Team communication has never been easier than with this system, as the entire memberlist is gathered in one place, with all the relevant informations and details.\n\nThe most used function in SportMember for the coach:\n* Automatic requests for the attendance of practice and matches \n* Calendar overview of the entire club\n* Overview of attending and non-attending members\n* Holiday calender where members can be excused from participation in the activities of their holiday period\n* Create statistics on the teams performance\n* Borrow a player from another team\n* Get in contact with your members swiftly\n\nSportMember’s most used functions for the members\n* Receive notifications, when an activity is coming up / cancelled \n* Registrering attendance fast\n* Team calendar with practice, matches and other activities\n* Coordinating lifts for the away matches\n* Pay membership invoices\n\nThe app kan be used for all types of sport, including:\n* Football\n* Handball\n* Gymnastics\n* Badminton\n* Basketball\n* Volleyball\n* Floorball\n* eSport\n* Athletics and much more\n\nWith SportMember it is also possible to create a free homepage for your club, and you will further be able to register for tournaments and other events. It is further possible to administrate membership payments through the automated notification system, so that the cashier saves the time and resources he would otherwise have spent on chasing down debtors.

That's the number of outcomes possible for the league matches for Cricket World Cup 2015, excluding Ties or No-Results!\n\nThen there are runs scored and wickets taken by both teams for each match. And one star performer out of 22 gets the Man of the Match award. The Man of the Tournament is even tougher odds: 1 out of 224!\n\nHow would you like to bet for outcomes of each matches, to see how you fare against others? Simply select any scheduled match, bet on the outcome, runs, wickets and man-of-match awards. When each match is over, you can see your score, as well as scores for other players of CricBet.\n\nInstead of using boring, real-world currency, you win points based on the accuracy of your predictions. Your score is tracked within Apple's Game Center, and you are ranked against a worldwide fanbase. All you need is a good knowledge of which teams are hot, which players are in form, and a hunch for what the scorecard would look like. Instead of sending messages or posting on Facebook, bet on CricBet and then share how accurate your predictions were. Good, clean fun, no match fixing required!\n\nTies (both teams scoring same number of runs) and upsets (when a lower-ranked team defeats a higher-ranked team) get you more points, and latter stages increase the points too. \n\nSo start playing now! All the best to you & your team!"

Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is!

      "label": "Golf’s first Artificial Intelligence platform, the Arccos Caddie app syncs with Arccos Caddie sensors to automatically track your shots while delivering Smart Distance club averages and game insights. The system also includes an A.I. powered GPS rangefinder and caddie advice for any hole on earth to help golfers of all skill levels make smarter decisions, improve faster and shoot lower scores.\n\nIn 2020, new Arccos Caddie members improved their handicap by a remarkable 5.02 strokes! \n\nThe winner of five-straight Golf Digest Editors’ Choice Awards (2016-2020), Arccos Caddie now features Strokes Gained Analytics (SGA). Providing players with the most advanced personalized insights in the game, SGA is the first platform to allow a player to select any target handicap – from Tour player to 20 – and measure their performance versus that goal across every game facet. SGA not only supports deep dives for all performance segments by each round or customizable periods, it automatically highlights a player’s top-3 strengths and weaknesses and provides tips from world-class instructors. \n\nFor golfers who prefer to prefer to play without having to carry a smartphone, Arccos Caddie Link is a perfect solution. This small, ultralight wearable allows Arccos players to capture their shot data without having to carry a smartphone on the course. Link seamlessly pairs with the Arccos Caddie app and sensors. Worn on a player’s belt, waistband or pocket, it tracks shots in real time – including the club used and precise location – and automatically transfers the data to a player’s smartphone via Bluetooth, either during or after the round. This allows golfers to play the game their way, freeing them to keep their phone in a cart, bag, back pocket or elsewhere.\n\n\nThe ideal way for players, coaches and clubfitters to dial improve decision-making, inform practice regimens and dial-in equipment choices, key Arccos Caddie features include:\n   - Automatic Shot Tracking\n   - Smart Distance Club Averages\n   - A.I. Powered GPS Rangefinder\n   - A.I. Caddie Advice (developed in partnership with Microsoft)\n   - Strokes Gained Analytics \n\nThe Arccos Caddie app works with Arccos Caddie Smart Sensors, and Arccos Caddie Smart Grips as well as a wide range of PING and Cobra golf clubs that come standard with Arccos Caddie sensors embedded in the grip (PING G710 and G425 clubs, and every club in the KING Cobra line). Arccos also has official partnerships with TaylorMade Golf, Club Champion, TXG and Cool Clubs.\n\n\nThe world’s most-used on-course golf app, Arccos Caddie has hundreds of thousands of registered users who have played millions of rounds and taken hundreds of millions of shots. Arccos Caddie also offers a tournament mode that Conforms to the Rules of Golf (USGA Decision #2017-0754).\n\n\n\nThe Arccos Caddie app uses the iPhone's GPS at the highest level of accuracy which can have an impact on battery usage.\n\nThe Arccos Caddie app supports Apple Watch and uses HealthKit to create a golf workout while you are playing golf.\n\nArccos End User License Agreement: https://www.arccosgolf.com/pages/end-user-license-agreement"

The intent is to solve problems associated with timing multiple swimmers/relays in the pool at one time.\n\nSwim Stopwatch's unique and original layout allows a single coach to time all of their swimmers while also freeing them up to focus on the race and not their watch.  All you need to do is hit the large button which creates individual split boxes for each split time.  You watch the race and hit the button whenever you need a split, then while swimmers are swimming their next leg you take a short moment to drag their split time to the appropriate lane and split number.  Swim Stopwatch will calculate the split and cumulative times for you so that you don't have to do any math.\n\n* Universal App - 3 lanes on screen at a time on iPhone, 6 lanes on iPad"

I've included unique features that I hope will make your pool-side experience a little more interesting and productive.\n\n+ You can set a goal time and race parameters.  This feature enables a progress bar and count-down timers giving instant feedback on your swimmer's progress anywhere in the pool as they strive to stay ahead of their goal. (The in-app purchase enables goal setting for the longer races.)\n\n+ You can record the swimmers strokerate at any time throughout the race. (The in-app purchase enables unlimited strokes per race.)\n\n+ You can fix mistakes.  For instance if you pressed \"stop\" instead of \"split\" there is a way to correct that.  Or if you forgot to hit \"split\" there is a way to insert an estimated or actual missing split later.\n\n+ pace goals can be programmed for the dive segment.  Everyone is faster during the first 15 meters after a dive.\n\n+ Handy buttons allow you to configure the location of starting blocks and the pool size.\n\n+ Although collecting splits is limited to a single swimmer in a race, you can record and save the finish time of multiple swimmers in the same race.\n\n+ Your swimmer's splits are automatically plotted on a graph.

Not only that, we have features that help with coaching and improving player performance.\n\nFeatures for Coaches:\n* Dot ball counter - encourage kids and junior cricketers to rotate the strike to keep the scoreboard ticking\n* Most common dismissals for each batter. You can analyse each batter and find the common dismissal type - i.e. you might find a batter is always caught-out. You can then coach them techniques to reduce the ball being hit the air.\n* and many more coach analysis tools including total wides bowled, total strike rate, etc\n\nFeatures for Scorers:\n* Do you sometimes forget to score a ball? We have a smart reminder system that will vibrate your phone if you forget to score a ball. Never forget to score a ball again!\n* Ability to score negative runs instead of a wicket (perfect for kids cricket!)\n* Ability to score a wide and NOT count as an extra ball in the over (perfect for kids cricket!)\n* and many more features to make score easy - including allowing a batter to bat twice in one innings, undo a wrong score, etc\n\nStats include:\nBatting Average\nHighest Score\nTotal Runs\nStrike Rate\nTotal Innings Batted\nTotal Outs\nTotal Sixes\nTotal Fours\nTotal Dots\nTotal Balls faced\nTotal times dismissed bowled\nTotal times dismissed caught\nand MANY MORE STATS!!\n\n\nExciting 'fresh' design.\nEvery cricket scorebook looks the same. Not true! We have designed our app differently! \n\nNo longer is the design boring. Instead of showing the batter list while you score, we show coaching suggestions, live stats, current partnership, total innings dot-balls/scoring shots, and other helpful cricket tips.\n\nWho is this app for?\n\nIf you are scoring or coaching kids cricket, youth cricket, social cricket, indoor cricket, gully cricket or backyard cricket - this app is for you. It keeps things simple, makes scoring fun, and is completely FREE (in-app purchase available for stats).\n\nWho is this app not for?\n\nIf you are a senior cricketer, or play in a competitive grade - we suggest looking at an app that is built specifically for enhanced scoring & statistics (note: another advantage of our app is that it is free! Other enhanced Cricket scoring apps do have a cost).\n\nDownload today!\nThis app is built for ease-of-use for kids, youth & social cricket. And for coaches who want live in-play suggestions to help improve batting & bowling.\n\nThere has never been a Cricket Scorebook App built for Kids, Youth or social cricket… until this one launched! Download for FREE today.\n\nThis app has been developed by cricketers, cricket coaches, kids cricket scorers and kid cricket umpires. Made for all cricketers, by cricketers!\n\nWe don't like cricket, we love it!\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

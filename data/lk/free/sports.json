Offering motocross riders (MY21 onwards) the finest technical touch, the KTMconnect app allows for a wide spectrum of set-up adjustability on the fly, a privilege until recently limited to the selected elite of KTM factory riders. \r\n \r\nBeing on top of your game and READY TO RACE could not be easier as the ENGINE feature allows customization of engine behavior, to suit personal rider preferences, while also giving valuable recommendations for inexperienced riders. Looking for the perfect feeling? The SUSPENSION feature recommends suspension settings based on skill level and track conditions but also assists the rider in evaluating and setting the correct suspension sag. \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nSUPPORTED BIKES: \r\n \r\nMY2017+ 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE R/S \r\nMY2019+ 790/890 ADVENTURE /R/RALLY \r\nMY2020+ 390 ADVENTURE \r\nMY2020+ 1290 SUPER DUKE R/RR/EVO \r\nMY2019+ 1290 SUPER DUKE GT \r\nMY2022+ BRABUS 1300R \r\n \r\nMY2020+ 450 SX-F FACTORY EDITION \r\nMY2021+ 450 SX-F \r\nMY2021+ 350 SX-F \r\nMY2021+ 250 SX-F \r\nMY2021 250 SX-F TROY LEE DESIGN \r\nMY2021+ 450 XC-F \r\nMY2021+ 350 XC-F \r\nMY2021 350 XC-F KAILUB RUSSELL \r\nMY2021+ 250 XC-F"

The 4dot6 cricket umpire run counter app will vibrate to remind when you have forgotten to score a ball.\n\nHow?\n\nThe app calculates the average time between balls - and when this time has gone over by 33% - we remind you with a slight vibrate. Now all you need to do is workout if the ball was pitching outside leg stump...\n\n\nHighest partnership\n\nAllow the app to assist with coaching by viewing the highest partnership, average partnership and current partnership. With this info you can encourage the batsman to bat a long innings to build large partnerships.\n\n\nCricket Umpires\n\nTime to update to the latest cricket umpire run counter. Everything you need to make sure you are accurately counting and scoring each ball.\n\n\nCricket Coaches\n\nInstall the latest cricket umpire over and ball counter to allow you to help coach your players to bat longer innings. The Total Dot Balls feature is a great tool to help encourage batsman to rotate the strike to keep the scoreboard ticking over.\n\n\nCricket Players\n\nAre you looking to get on the good side of your regular cricket umpire? Install this app on your umpires phone and you’ll be shown the ‘going down leg’ gesture for your next few innings!"

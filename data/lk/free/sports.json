Helps you to improve your snooker game with an extensive list of practice routines and sessions. Using Augmented Reality (AR), practice routines are projected in real-time on your snooker table. You can also create your own custom practice routines using the built-in table editor and project them on your snooker table using augmented reality (AR)! Enter your practice results in the app and see your improvement, day-by-day. Contains a lot of widgets that you can put on your home screen to track your matches, frames, breaks, and much more.\n\nHere is what some players are saying about SnookerCoach:\n\n**** So much easier than writing my matches out by hand and working out the percentages for my stats. It's the best app for snooker practice\n\n**** It's great that you can enter your match and frame scores in the app. This motivates me to win the next time I encounter the same player.\n\n**** I am a beginning snooker player. The practice routines in Snooker Coach 147 motivated me to practice more and I do many different routines now, instead of always playing the same line-up.\n\n**** I used to go to my local club to 'knock some balls around' as practice. Snooker Coach 147 has helped me to practice more focused to complete each routine successfully. I am winning more matches and playing with more confidence."

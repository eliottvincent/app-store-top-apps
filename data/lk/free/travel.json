Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

It is currently available to international air travellers who enter Canada at selected airports.\n\nBy submitting your customs and immigration information in advance, you will spend less time at a primary inspection kiosk (PIK) or eGate when you arrive at the airport. This contributes to shorter line-ups in arrivals halls.\n\nAt the border, you will be prompted to scan your travel document at a primary inspection device and confirm your identity. Once your identity has been confirmed, your Advance CBSA Declaration will be retrieved from ArriveCAN for you to review and certify. If changes are required, you can edit and update your declaration prior to certification.\n\nUse of the Advance CBSA Declaration feature of ArriveCAN is entirely optional.\n\nPlease refer to the accessibility notice for this app: https://www.canada.ca/en/border-services-agency/services/arrivecan.html#accessibility-notice\n\nThis app supports English, French and Spanish (as per your device’s language settings).\n\nFor more information: http://www.canada.ca/ArriveCAN"

      "label": "Yandex Go is an app to request rides, order food from restaurants or send items across town. Request a ride or delivery with just a tap and track your driver in real time. Never waste time again with another call center or parking problem.\n\n• AFFORDABLE FARES\nChoose a service class for any occasion. Ride Economy for everyday errands, treat yourself to Comfort and Comfort+ to relax in a more spacious car, or go with Business when every detail counts. Use Delivery to ship items of any size by car. Fares and available service classes vary by location, but we always show the exact price (or a fair estimate) before you request a ride.\n\n• PAY BY CARD OR CASH\nYou can pay for rides automatically if you add your card in the app, but drivers also accept cash. Payment method availability may vary depending on location.\n\n• A SMART APP THAT SAVES YOU TIME\nYandex Go uses smart algorithms built on live traffic data to connect riders with drivers who can reach them fastest. Depending on your location, the app will also suggest alternative pickup points to help lower your fare.\n\n• RIDES WITH MULTIPLE STOPS\nRequest a ride with multiple destinations, like if you’re dropping your kids off at school, picking up a friend on the way, or need to run a quick errand. Yandex Go maps all your stops on one route and calculates the fare for the entire trip upfront.\n\n• CHILD SAFETY SEATS\nChoose the Kids service class to ride safely with your child in a safety or booster seat.\nCurrently available in the capitals of Armenia, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan, as well as 169 cities across Russia.\n\n• FOOD FROM RESTAURANTS\nOrder food from local cafes and restaurants. Just enter your address and we’ll show you everything that’s available nearby. Narrow down your search with filters and find your favorites or try something new. Currently available in Russia and Kazakhstan.\n\n• SCOOTERS\nScooters are back in Krasnodar!\nFind them in the Yandex Go app. We added the Fixed rate and an in-app Navigator for rides to a specific address with upfront pricing.\nRent up to 3 scooters on the same account.\nIf you have Yandex Plus, subscribe to Scooters and get free starts in all rates and free wait time during rides. The first month of subscription is ₽0.\n\n• FAMILY ACCOUNT\nYou can open a family account in Yandex Go. Family accounts are a great way to take care of your whole family and pay for their taxi rides. A single family account can have 4 members all using the same bank card. The family account can also be used to pay for orders in lots of different Yandex services, not just Taxi. Family members can share their location during rides, and the account owner can set limits and view the order history.\n\n• AVAILABLE IN 10 COUNTRIES\nRussia, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Lithuania, Serbia and Moldova. Visit https://taxi.yandex.com to see rates and availability in your city.\n\nIf you’d like to share your opinion about our app, a driver or company that handled your ride, please send us feedback in the app."

The application also complements the standard operational procedures (SOPs) established in the Park in 2021 by providing visitors with an opportunity for the visitors to rate their visitor experiences.\nThe application has several features, and the users can virtually visit different locations inside the Park and access background information on those iconic locations, especially the flora and fauna species, history and more. Regarding a self-guided safari tour feature, visitors can access an interactive map depicting the immense Park. With this map, visitors can navigate themselves to many locations, which are classified into the following categories:\nPark entrances\nBungalows\nCampsites\nAreas Reserved for Resting\nVisitor facilities\nLocations of historical significance\nWildlife-viewing areas\nIn addition, visitors can access comprehensive information on the laws and regulations of the Park, as well as safety precautions and the sites inside the Park where they can obtain first aid services in the event of an emergency.\nThe application can be accessed in three different languages: English, Sinhala, and Tamil. And the application was created to serve consumers with diverse backgrounds, both domestically and internationally.\nDue to the restricted connectivity across the Park, visitors will have connection issues while on their journey. Therefore, the application was developed with offline features that can even function even when the user is not connected to the internet, which assures the safety and interactive visitor experience throughout the park visit.\nOne of the app's distinctive characteristics is that it provides virtual tours with 360-panoramic pictures of the cultural and wildlife-rich areas inside the truly vast Park. Users can better imagine what it would be like to be at the locations because of the immersive experience provided by this feature."

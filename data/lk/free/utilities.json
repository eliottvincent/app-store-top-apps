      "label": "Get the people-first browser that’s backed by a non-profit. \n\nIt’s a new era in tech. Don’t settle for a browser produced by giant, profit-driven, data-hoarding tech companies. Firefox is the obvious choice for independent, ethical tech that respects your privacy and gives you more ways than ever to tailor your internet experience exactly the way you want it. Download Firefox now for iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nFirefox is backed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, whose mission is to ensure the internet remains a global public resource, open and accessible to everyone. When you make Firefox your go-to, everyday browser, you’re also joining a unique (serious nerd cred) community that’s actively helping to diversify the way people experience the internet.  \n\nFirefox is extremely private for a reason — and the reason is you. \nWe want you to have an amazing experience every time you use Firefox. We know feeling safe and secure are foundational for enjoying your time online. Since version 1 in 2004, we’ve taken privacy seriously, because we’ve always been in the business of valuing people first, over everything. When you care more about people than profits, privacy naturally becomes a top priority.\n\nDIFFERENT DEVICES.  SAME TRAIN OF THOUGHT\nNow you can search for things on your laptop, then pick up the exact same search on your phone and vice versa. Your Firefox homepage displays the most recent searches you’ve done on other devices so you can easily get back to what you were doing or thinking about. \n\nLIMITED-EDITION WALLPAPERS\nIntroducing limited-edition wallpapers from independent creators. Stick with one you love or switch it up anytime to make Firefox match your mood. \n\n\nSTREAMLINED HOME SCREEN\nPick up right where you left off. See all your open tabs intuitively grouped and displayed along with your recent bookmarks, top sites and popular articles recommended by Pocket.\n\nPRIVACY CONTROL IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES\nFirefox gives you greater privacy protection while you’re on the web. By default, Firefox blocks trackers and scripts such as social media trackers, cross-site cookie trackers, cryptominers and fingerprinters. In addition to Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention, setting Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection to strict blocks tracking content in all windows. Also, you can easily choose to search in private browsing mode. And when you close private browsing mode, your browsing history and any cookies are automatically erased from your device.\n\nGET FIREFOX ON  ALL YOUR DEVICES\nAdd Firefox across your devices for secure, seamless browsing. In addition to synced tabs and searches, Firefox makes password management easy by remembering your passwords across devices.\n\nFIND IT FAST WITH FIREFOX’S SEARCH BAR\nGet search suggestions in the search bar and quickly access the sites you visit most. Type in your search question and get suggested and previously searched results across your favorite search engines.\n\nORGANIZE YOUR TABS THE WAY YOU LIKE\nCreate as many tabs as you like without losing track. Firefox displays your open tabs as thumbnails and numbered tabs, making it easy to find what you want quickly.\n\nSHARE ANYTHING IN A FEW TAPS\nThe Firefox web browser makes it easy to share links to web pages or specific items on a page with easy, quick access to your most recently used apps.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT FIREFOX WEB BROWSER:\n- Read about Firefox permissions: http://mzl.la/Permissions\n- Learn more about what’s up at Mozilla: https://blog.mozilla.org\n\nABOUT MOZILLA\nMozilla exists to build the Internet as a public resource accessible to all because we believe open and free is better than closed and controlled. We build products like Firefox to promote choice and transparency and give people more control over their lives online.

      "label": "KeyNounce is the easiest way to type in Tamil using just the English keyboard. KeyNounce uses a technique called \"transliteration\" that enables you to type the Tamil pronunciation in English, instantly giving you back the word written in Tamil.\n\nFor example, typing \"Vanakkam\" will be converted into the Tamil letters right as you type! It’s simple, fast and super accurate. You don’t need to worry about typing in the exact English spelling for an Tamil word, KeyNounce is smart enough to accept many input spellings for the same output word.\n\nIf you can write, or read Tamil, but aren’t used to typing using the Tamil keyboard, KeyNounce is the perfect solution for you.\n\nKeyNounce works in any app! Once you enable the keyboard you’ll be able to easily compose texts, emails, tweets, facebook posts, and search the web in Tamil.\n\nWatch the video above and see for yourself how useful KeyNounce can be."

      "label": "KeyNounce is the easiest way to type in Sinhala using just the English keyboard. KeyNounce uses a technique called \"transliteration\" that enables you to type the Sinhala pronunciation in English, instantly giving you back the word written in Sinhala.\n\nFor example, typing \"Kohomada\" will be converted into the Sinhala letters right as you type! It’s simple, fast and super accurate. You don’t need to worry about typing in the exact English spelling for an Sinhala word, KeyNounce is smart enough to accept many input spellings for the same output word.\n\nIf you can write, or read Sinhala, but aren’t used to typing using the Sinhala keyboard, KeyNounce is the perfect solution for you.\n\nKeyNounce works in any app! Once you enable the keyboard you’ll be able to easily compose texts, emails, tweets, facebook posts, and search the web in Sinhala."

These steps could avoid the lost data being overwritten before you recover them. And you could set data recovery reminder to remind you get lost data when you are ready.\n\nIt is necessary to download the recovery and backup software in your computer to finish the recovery and backup. The computer software could allow you to preview your lost data in the interface and backup data. Finally, recovery success varies with loss circumstances and device condition--there are no 100% guarantees in theory--but we go above and beyond. \n\nPlease feel free to contact ifonebox@auntec.com if you have any question or need any help.

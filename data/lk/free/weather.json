      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

The change in the weather condition has worsened air quality.\n\n• Air is the Earth's atmosphere. Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear gas in which living things live and breathe. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no colour or smell. It has mass and weight, because it is matter. The weight of air creates atmospheric pressure. There is no air in outer space. \n• Air is a mixture of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and very small amounts of other gases.\n• Air can be polluted by some gases (such as carbon monoxide), smoke, and ash. This air pollution causes various problems including smog, acid rain and global warming. It can damage people's health.\n• The Air Quality data sources varies depending on the cities.\n\n\n\nPLACES:\n- Store favourite places to find out Air Quality Info easily.\n- Easy to navigate to the bookmarked places and find pollution level instantly.\n\n\nMAP: \n- You can check all the near by City’s Air Quality Index on Map\n- Providing the Air Quality info city wise.\n- Plan your visit based on the good AQI for the specific city.\n\n\nWEATHER:\n- Show weather conditions for the current place.\n- Show sunrise and sunset time.\n\n\nNEWS:\n- Get up to date with latest Air Quality Data and Air Pollution news using Google News.\n- The latest News provides option for planning the journey for any new places based on pollution levels.\n\n\nAIR QUALITY INDEX CHART: \n- You can check the range of quality indexes and info about Index is good or bad\n- Distinguish between different indexes with color so the user can easily understand the level of pollution.\n\n\nCOUNTRY LIST: \n- You can check the country list and select your city to get the AQI info\n- Providing the country name and flag so easily identify and fid the top cities for the selected country.\n\n\nProviding below gases information in Air using this app: - CO (Carbon Oxide) \n- NO2 (Nitrogen dioxide)\n- O3 (Ozon)\n- PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter)\n- PM25 (particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter)\n- SO2 (Sulfer dioxide)\n- T \n- W\n- WG \n- H (Hydrogen)\n- DEW (Hydrocarbon Dew)\n\n\n\nAQI LEVELS DEFINITION:\n\n• Green: AQI (0 - 50) | Good\nAir quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk\n\n• Yellow: AQI\t(51 -100) | Moderate\nAir quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.\n\n• Orange: AQI\t(101-150) | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\nMembers of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is not likely to be affected.\n\n• Red: AQI (151-200) | Unhealthy\nEveryone may begin to experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects\n\n• Purple: AQI (201-300)\t| Very Unhealthy\nHealth warnings of emergency conditions.

      "label": "The NERV Disaster Prevention App is a smartphone service that delivers earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption and emergency warnings, as well as provides weather-related disaster prevention information for flooding and landslides, optimised based on the user's current and registered locations.\n\nThe app was developed to help people living in or visiting an area where damage is expected to occur, to accurately assess the situation and make quick decisions and actions.\n\nWith information received directly through a leased line connected to the Japan Meteorological Agency, our proprietary technology enables the fastest information distribution in Japan.\n\n\n▼　All the information you need, in one app\n\nGet a wide range of disaster prevention information, including weather and typhoon forecasts, rain radar, earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruption alerts, emergency weather warnings and landslide information, river information, and heavy rain risk notifications.\n\nBy interacting with the map on the screen, you can zoom in on your location or pan across the country and see the cloud cover, typhoon forecast areas, tsunami warning areas, or the scale and intensity of an earthquake.\n\n\n①　Providing users with the most appropriate disaster information\n\nThe home screen displays the information you need at the time and place you need it. When there’s an earthquake, the home screen will show you the latest information. If another type of warning or alert is issued while the earthquake is active, the app will sort them depending on the type, elapsed time and urgency, so you’ll always have the most important information at your fingertips.\n\n\n②　Push Notifications for Important Information\n\nWe send out different types of notifications depending on the device’s location, the type of information and level of urgency. If the information is not urgent, we send a silent notification as not to disturb the user. For more urgent situations where a disaster is time-sensitive, a ‘Critical Alert’ alerts the user to an imminent danger. Notifications like Earthquake Early Warnings (Alert level) and Tsunami Warnings will be forced to sound, even if the device is in Silent or Do Not Disturb modes.\n\nNote: Critical Alerts will only be sent to users in the target area of the most urgent types of disasters. Users who have registered their location but are not in the target area will instead receive a normal notification.\n\n※ In order to receive Critical Alerts, you need to set your location permissions to “Always Allow” and have Background App Refresh turned on. If you don’t want Critical Alerts, you can disable them from Settings.\n\n\n③　Barrier-Free Design\n\nWe paid close attention when designing the app to ensure our information is accessible to everyone.

      "label": "Simple and beautiful rustic style Thermometer now in your iPhone or iPad.\n\nWhat people say about HD Thermometer ⊎:\n\n- It is a great app! It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "With growing concern about air pollution, we bring you an app that will help you monitor the air quality around you, your city and any other place across the globe.\nThe app shows air quality index for any city so you can search to check AQI for that area. Details show the index and 6 major pollutants being tracked along with health advisory for the same. \n\nYou can get alerts from the app.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Air quality index.\n- Air quality index by city\n- Air quality index data for - 10,000 stations in 800 major cities from 70 countries\n-Weather\n- Monitoring of 6 key Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide\n- Complete Health Index chart available for reference\n- Trusted Air Quality Data from AQICN http://aqicn.org\n- Automatically fetch and display local Air Quality and Air Pollution data as a pollution meter from the nearest reporting station using your phone's GPS location.\n- Data used for air quality index includes ground-level ozone, particulate matter, pm10, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitric oxide, and nitrogen dioxide. \n- Easy to understand pollution meter.\n- Search Air Pollution and Air Quality data for any location by City name.\n- Contains Air Pollution / Air Quality data for over 60 countries including in over 60 countries including Canada, United States Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Turkey and India.\n- Display up to date Air Quality Index (AQI) data for the selected location. \n- Displays basic weather metrics for a selected location such as: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind vector (wind speed, wind direction).\n- Maintains a list of recently searched locations for easy look up and Air Quality reference.\n\nThe air quality index is based on the five 'criteria' pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act:\n\n• ground-level ozone\n• particulate matter\n• carbon monoxide\n• sulphur dioxide\n• nitrogen dioxide\n• CO (Carbon Oxide) \n• NO2 (Nitrogen dioxide)\n• O3 (Ozon)\n• PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter)\n• PM25 (particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter)\n• SO2 (Sulfer dioxide)\n• T \n• W\n• WG \n• H (Hydrogen)\n• DEW (Hydrocarbon Dew)\n\nOften the weather can be the cause of air pollution. In cold winter nights without wind, there is a higher possibility the air quality to worsen due to temperature inversion.\nParticulate matter is removed primarily by rainfall. If the pollution level of the air is moderate to high and it starts raining, about 60 minutes are needed to see a difference. This is why weather can cause and solve the air pollution problem.\n\nThis air quality index app is great for anyone concerned about air quality, air pollution, and weather conditions in countries such as India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Pakistan , United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Czech Republic, India, Singapore, South Africa, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and air quality in their general vicinity especially in heavily polluted regions like those around Beijing and eastern China,India, New Delhi.\n\nVIP MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS are now available!\n\nJoin in VIP Membership, you can get the paid functions below:\n• Ads will not appear inside the app \n• Different types of pollution maps\n• Apple Watch support\n• Specific notifications for your location\n\nNote: Air Quality offers two auto-renewing subscription options: $0.99 one month, $ 4,99 six months, $8,99 one year.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here -\nhttps://alejandro99aru.wixsite.com/misitio/terms-conditions\n\nRead more about our privacy policy here - \nhttps://alejandro99aru.wixsite.com/misitio/privacy-policy"

      "label": "This app uses the barometric pressure sensor built into all the newer iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch Models sold after 2016 with few exceptions. You need one of these newer devices to use this App. See below which older iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch without this sensor are not supported!\n\nThis App features a Barometer for weather, an Altimeter for outdoor activities, a barometric Trend and a Notification Center Widget.\n\nEven without the optional In-App-Purchase this is a fully functional Barometer with absolutely no draw-backs and all important features accessible. Always without ads! (See \"Pro Features\" at the end). No internet connection required, no data transmitted - runs on your device only!\n\nKeep an eye on the barometric pressure and be your own weather forecast! This little app uses only GPS (optional) and the new barometric pressure sensor to calculate the barometric pressure used in weather forecasts. The new iPhones have a barometric pressure sensor built in so this app works completely without internet. The handy marker helps you keep track of changes in the barometric pressure and let's you predict weather changes! Please realize, that a single barometric pressure reading is not enough to tell the current weather situation but the barometric pressure and its change over time is a very good indicator for weather changes!\n\nNow you can also see the trend in barometric pressure with graph charts displaying the measurements taken during the last 30 days! (6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d)\n\nThe Altimeter helps you track your altitude changes based on the change of pressure. Just set your reference pressure and altitude in order to use the Altimeter for checking how high up the mountain you have climbed (works for other activities too). The App does not use GPS for the Altimeter.\n\nPlease Note that on older devices such as the 4S, 5, 5S and 5C as well as on any iPod Touch and iPad Models older than iPad Air 2 or iPad Mini 4 as well as the Apple Watch 1 and 2, this app will not be able to read barometric pressure values and not display any useful information. The first generation 4-inch iPhone SE is not supported - the new SE (2020) is!\n\nAll basic features, the Barometer, the Altimeter, the Trend and the Widget are completely free to use for everyone and are fully functional at maximum accuracy available. No ads!\nThe only features with restricted access via In-App-Purchase are listed at the end under \"Pro Features\". Those are nice to have features for power users or those that want to show their support for the App!\n\nFeatures (free for everyone)\n- Barometer for weather\n- Altimeter for outdoor activities\n- HomeScreen Widget (iOS 14 and newer)\n- Today-View Widget (all Versions)\n- Watch App\n- Up to 30d trend visualised with graphs\n- Interactive timeline on the trend graphs\n- No internet connection required since the sensor is built into the new iPhones and iPads\n- Supports 6 different pressure units\n- Support for 2 different altitude units\n- Analog Barometer with support for all 6 units\n- Configurable \"displayed accuracy\" / number of decimals\n- Supports setting a custom marker so you can track changes in barometric pressure\n- Manual altitude setting or automatic altitude updates based on GPS for the Barometer.\n- GPS Correction. In case your GPS seems to always be 'off' a little you can now fix this easily.\n- Portrait and Landscape support\n- No ads! No data collection beyond your device (history and settings). No web communication at all.\n\nPro Features (one time In-App Purchase required)\n- Change the Barometer Face\n- Fishing Barometer\n- Two scales on the Barometer\n- Data export in CSV Format"

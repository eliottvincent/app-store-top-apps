      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

      "label": "The infosphere, Visualized.\n\nEvery time we use our phones, tablets or laptops we are entering an invisible world of wireless digital signals. It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

Start off easy with an app that will guide you around the night sky - and even entertain you a little when the skies are cloudy.\n\n\"The app works beautifully, making astronomy a bit less mysterious—but no less remarkable\", MacWorld\n\n \"It’s truly an impressive marvel. 5 Mice out of 5\", MacWorld.\n\n \"..one of the prettiest and easiest to use. And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more. You can literally hold up your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in front of you, and the app will use the built-in compass to display the same view of the sky you see - but one that's complete with names and information. \n\nThen explore the Solar System, and take virtual walks on the surface of the Moon and Mars, before playing a game to help you learn more about astronomy that you thought possible.\n\nEvery night there is something to see: Pocket Universe will provide you a list of suggestions, as well as give you regularly updated news and observation tips - which you can even share with your friends.\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert to use Pocket Universe, and everything you see has a useful pop-up information window and links to Wikipedia for the latest information.\n\nWith over 80,000 stars, beautiful textures, built-in quiz games, updated news, lunar phases, information on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, an Orrery view, and more, there’s so much to explore.\n\nFor support or to ask a question, feel free to send a direct message on Twitter to @CraicDesign or email john@craicdesign.com.\n\nKey Features\n\nPocket Universe was the first iPhone astronomy app to support the built-in compass, and it was also the first to add a true augmented reality view using the iPhone's built-in camera! Use the camera view in the evening or morning sky to overlay the labelled view over the real sky.\n\nSimply hold up your iPhone in front of you, and the view will be exactly what you see - but with names and information at your fingertips. Move the iPhone around to see the view change in real-time. \n\nEasy-to-use astronomy application, which focuses on helping you answer the question \"What's that in the sky?\"\n\n• Works on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices running latest IOS\n\n• Supports augmented reality views that put the solar system in your living room, or all around you with 3rd party stereo headsets (available separately).\n\n• Tracks the International Space Station, and predicts sightings.\n\n• Tells you how long every day is, and tracks changes over the year.\n\n• Special \"Show Me\" mode will guide you to named stars, planets, constellations as well as the brightest galaxies and nebulae. \n\n• \"Tonight's Sky\" and \"Objects and Events\" will keep you up-to-date, and give you suggestions for what to look for when you head outside.\n\n• Constellation and Star Quiz to help you learn your way around the sky.\n\n• Works in Northern Hemisphere and ‘Down Under’ too.\n\n• Links to Wikipedia articles for the latest information.\n\n• Responsive customer support, frequent updates.\n\nPlease note: Network access is only required to view supplementary web-based news and Wikipedia text.

It’s the kind of thing you can imagine a science teacher using in the classroom of the future — except that we don’t have to wait.” - CNet\n \n“Zoom from Mercury to Pluto (which makes the cut in this app), passing each planet’s moons along the way. Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation. Turn into an astronomer and explore planets, moons, satellites, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, stars and other celestial bodies. Enjoy gorgeous graphics and visuals while navigating through the solar system!\n\n► Make virtual flights from one space object to another.\n\n► Travel in time and see what the universe and our Solar system looked like at a certain period.\n\n► Find an exciting view of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n► Watch a collection of educational solar system movies to learn about space-related topics including Earth's moon phases, Earth's cycles, tidal phenomena, and zodiacal constellations.*\n\n► Enjoy 3D planetarium with the help of special glasses and activating the anaglyph mode.\n\n► Share interesting screenshots of the app with your friends.\n\n► Choose the view mode comfortable for you (orrery/true-to-scale).\n\n*Available through In-App Purchases.\n\nSolar Walk is a great educational tool appropriate for both adults and children.

      "label": "このアプリのコンセプトは「英語脳」を作るための「脳トレジム」アプリです。「英語脳」の元となる、それぞれ別の「筋肉」を鍛える６つのトレーニングマシーンで日頃トレーニングして、「英語脳」の「神経回路」を作ってください。\n日本トップクラスの英語講師であるニック・ウィリアムソンが、最短で「英語脳」を作りあげる画期的なメソッドを作りました。細かい文法を考えずに、文法的に正しい、尚且つ自然な英語が話せるようになりたい人にとってはこのメソッドが1番です。教室に通えない人のために、教室で行なっているドリルや練習をアプリ化しました。アプリ内には、ニック先生による分かりやすくてためになるレッスン動画がたくさんあります。そちらを観て、その後、６つのトレーニングマシーンで、どんどん発信する練習を重ねていきます。\n英語が話せるようになるためには、英語をどんどん発信することが欠かせない要素の一つです。ネイティブが言った文をリピーティングするだけでも、少しは効果がありますが、自分で文を組み立てられるようになりたいなら、自分で文を組み立てる練習も必要になります。\n「ニック式英会話ジム」では自分がパーツを組み合わせて作った文、テンプレートに沿って、英語の思考回路に沿って自分が作った文を、ネイティブが読んでくれるので、それをリピーティングすることができます。発音の練習と文章作りの練習を同時にできます。英語の思考回路を脳に焼き付けることができて、ネイティブのような自然な英語が話せるようになります。\nそれでは、６つのトレーニングマシーンを紹介します：\n1.\t「置き換え」\nこのマシンが一番シンプルですが、「英語脳」育成にはとっても効果的です。\nたとえば「How old are you?」の「old」を別の単語に置き換えて「How hungry are you?（どれくらいお腹空いているの？）」「How sick are you?（どれくらい具合悪いの？）」「How confident are you?（自信のほどは？）」などと、新しい表現を作っていきます。１つの表現を覚えて終わらせずに、簡単な単語を置き換えていくことで言えることが数十倍の量になります。言語を学ぶ上で、この「置き換え頭」は大変役立つスキルです。日本語に合わせて表現を作ろうとせずに、このように英語の表現に合わせて応用する頭になるからです。このマシンはそのスキルを養うトレーニングマシンです。「形容詞」を置き換えたり、「名詞」を置き換えたり、「動詞」を置き換えたりすることができます。\n2.\t「A＋B」\n２つのパーツ、２つの決まっているフレーズを「A＋B」のように組み合わせます。\nたとえば「I was going to（するつもりだった）」という塊と「change jobs（転職する）」という塊を組み合わせて「I was going to change jobs.（転職するつもりだった）」と文を作っていきます。又、「一般」「仕事」「遊び」「恋愛」「家事」など、様々なカテゴリーが選択できます。動詞の原形が続く表現、動詞のing形が続く表現、動詞の過去分詞が続く表現などと、様々な表現がありますが、アプリがすべて正しい形に変換してくれるので、間違った文を作ることは不可能です。自分が作った文をネイティブが読んでくれるので、それをリピーティングします。脳と口を同時に慣らすことできます。このマシーンだけで約6万通りの組み合わせがあります。「学習」モードと「テスト」モードがあります。\n3.\t「3 STEP」\nネイティブと同じ思考回路で短文を作りましょう。\n特に時制の使い分けに関しては、日本語と英語は全く違います。日本語に惑わされないように、３ステップのテンプレートに沿って考える「英語の思考回路」を身につけましょう。日本語に囚われているからこそ、苦労もしますし、不自然な英語になります。本当の英語はもっともっと簡単です。日本語をヒントにせずに、内容で判断しながら３つのステップに沿って文を作ります。日本語英語よりも楽に、ネイティブ感覚の英語になります。そして、日本語から訳さずに、最初から英語で考えられるようになります。自分が作った文をネイティブが読んでくれるので、それをリピーティングしましょう。このマシンには2万ほどの文例が登録されています。「フラッシュカード」「学習」「テスト」と３つのモードがあります。\n4.\t「Q」\n瞬時に質問ができるスキルを身につけましょう。\n質問することは、会話の大切な１部です。しかし、質問がしたくても「何と言えばいいんだろう？」と考えているうちに会話がどんどん進んでしまって、聞きそびれることが多いものですよね。聞きたい質問をすぐにその場で言える必要があります。すぐに言えるようになるためには、質問をシンプルに意識しましょう。たとえば「did you」「is he going to」「do you want to」などを「塊」として覚えて、その「塊」を「Where … go?」「What time … get up?」などの間に入れ替えて、シンプルに質問を組み合わせます。組み合わせた質問をネイティブが読んでくれるので、それをリピーティングしましょう。\n5.\t「A」\n英語でされた質問に対して、反射的に英語で返せる「反射神経」を作りましょう。\nほとんどの人は、英語で質問をされた時に、日本語に訳して理解して、そのあと、「動詞のチョイスは何？」「時制はどうする？」「活用はどうなる？」「前置詞は必要？」などといろんなことを考えながら、イチから答えを作ろうとします。それでは、難しい上に、時間がかかりすぎて会話に付いていけないですね。実は、１度日本語にせずに、文法を考えずに、正しい英語で反射的に答えられるテクニックがあります。このマシンでは、反射的に英語を英語で返す「反射神経」を作っていきます。アプリがどんどん質問をしてくるので、それを反射的に返していきます。「時制」を個別に練習することもできますし、「ランダム」モードでは「時制」をごちゃ混ぜにして練習することもできます。「ランダム」モードでは、アプリと本当に会話している感覚になるので、本当の会話にかなり備えられます。\n6.\t「音読」\n発音をネイティブに近づけることでリスニングができるようになりましょう。\n聞き取りができるようになるためには、自分の発音をネイティブに近づけることが必要です。発音の解説動画でコツを掴み、「会話例」を通して、聞き取りの練習や発音の練習をいろいろな角度からやっていきます。各会話例は７ステップで練習を進めていきます。特に「タッチ＆リリース」機能がおすすめです。長い文をリピーティングするのは大変ですが、短く始まって、少しずつ繰り返す範囲を伸ばしていくと、長い文でもできるようになります。「タッチ＆リリース」では画面に触れて音声が始まり、画面から指を離すと音声が止まります。つまり、リピーティングする範囲を自分で決められます。「A役」「B役」を選んで、アプリと一緒に「会話例」を音読する練習もします。録音して、自分の発音を確認することもできます。更に、会話例で使われている「文法」と「時制」を「色分け表示」で見ることもできて、とても分かりやすくなっています。会話例は１３０あり、それを「文法別」「シチュエーション別」で検索も可能です。"

It seems to work.” 148apps.com \n\nPocketPhonics teaches kids letter sounds, first words and handwriting. It is used in hundreds of elementary schools and pre-schools, and tens of thousands of homes. It is aligned with the Common Core State Standards, and independent research (see appsinmypocket.com/research) found children learnt nine times faster using PocketPhonics compared to a classroom lesson.  \n\n\"One of my children’s favorite early reading apps\" New York Times\n“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com\n-“If you are working on phonics for your kids, this is the best application to have.” Technology in Education \n-“This app feels much like a private tutoring session for early readers with emphasis on letter sounds and writing.” everythingmom.com \n-“PocketPhonics is seriously educational and I think it’s a terrific tool for helping early readers. You can tell that a ton of thought and research was put into it and best of all, they talked and listened to teachers. It shows.” iPhoneMom.com \n-“When it comes to learning apps for young learners and early readers, there is no better choice than PocketPhonics.\" ipad-applications.neiia.com\n\nPocketPhonics is split in to 12 groups of letter sounds, each group is followed by a set of storybooks that use those letter sounds. Kids read storybooks that are on the right level for them. \n\nThe phonics levels are included in the price of this \"basic edition\", but the storybooks cost extra. PocketPhonics Stories (full edition) includes the stories in the price.\n\nPhonics (letter sounds) help children to read by understanding the sounds that letters make. The  National Reading Panel concluded that “children who have phonics instruction read better and spell better than other children”.\n\nIn the first group of letter sounds, there are six sounds to master before the child will be able to read their first storybook. Most children aged 4+  start to read their first storybook within 10 weeks if they use the app for 15 mins everyday. \n\nParents and teachers can easily monitor children’s progress online. Teachers and parents are emailed a certificate when a child completes a task.\n\nChildren can tap an unfamiliar word in a story, and the app will sound out the letters to help the child understand what the word says. They can tap again to hear the actual word and see a picture that illustrates its meaning. \n\nAs the child reads a story, the app tests whether they can read some of the key words.  At the end of the story, it quizzes the child on all new words in that story.\n\nChildren master the following skills:\n\nwriting letters\nrecognising 72 letter sounds (e.g. ‘ch’ are the letters that make the initial sound in ‘chat’)\n* blending letter sounds together to make words (e.g ‘ch-a-t’)\n* hearing a word and selecting its written form (e.g. the app says, “chat”, the child has to select ‘chat’ from a group of words)\n\nHow it works\n* The phonics levels are included in the price.\n* The books are extra, but can be tried for free.  $1.49 monthly and $14.49 annual subscriptions unlock access to all books for an unlimited number of children \n* The subscription gives you access to more books as they are added\n* Once subscribed, your subscription auto-renews each month or annually. However, you can easily turn auto renew off via the Settings app\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* Cannot cancel current subscription during its subscription period\n\nPrivacy policy:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/privacy\n\nTerms of use:\nhttp://appsinmypocket.com/terms"

If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!! \n\nBut first let me tell you a story…. \n****************************************** \nOnce upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. \n\nThe legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. \n\nAll that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure! \n****************************************** \n\nBut, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! \n\nAnd now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me? \n\nThank you for your purchase!"

Each player profile consists of a unique name (up to 20 characters) and a fun cartoon avatar. The player profiles display total number of games played, total number of high scores achieved, and total number of Bingo Bugs collected. The guest profile does not store any information and therefore cannot achieve high scores or collect Bingo Bugs. The guest profile is useful for adults who want to play Math Bingo without their scores going into the scoreboard. \n\nSelecting a Game\nThere are five different games in Math Bingo: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Mixed. Players will be prompted to select a game type before game play. Selecting a Level There are three levels of game play in Math Bingo: easy, medium, and hard. Players will be prompted to select a game level before game play. Score Board Math Bingo displays high scores in the Score Board. There are four different Score Boards: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Each Score Board displays the top three scores for each level: easy, medium, and hard. \n\nBingo Bugs \nBingo Bugs are rewards for achieving a high score. A player who earns a high score will collect a Bingo Bug! Players can collect a variety of Bingo Bugs and interact with them by tapping the Bingo Bug button in the player profile or by tapping the My Bingo Bugs button after playing a game. HINT: Tilt your device to make the Bingo Bugs move around, tap on a Bingo Bug to make them giggle and spring! \n\nSettings\nThe settings menu can be accessed by clicking the information button on the lower right hand side the introduction screen. The settings menu will allow you to reset all high scores and to delete player profiles. \n\n-----------------------------\nPRIVACY DISCLOSURE Math BINGO:\n- Does not contain third-party ads. \n- Does not contain in-app purchases.\n- Does not contain integration with social networks. \n- Does not use analytics/data collection tools. \n- Does include links to apps by ABCya.com in the iTunes App Store. \n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please visit: http://www.abcya.com/mobile_app_privacy_policy.htm\n ---------------------------"

      "label": "The OFFICIAL ABRSM Aural Trainer contains interactive challenges to help develop your music aural skills (listening skills). Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 6 to 8. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher. \n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it).\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n• Improve your recognition of cadences, chords and modulations. \n• Learn to describe texture, structure, dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Cadences\n• Chords\n• Modulations\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again . The app also features supporting tools including a cadence trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit."

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

Based on the Leitner-System, means questions will be repeated again and again as long as the child learned the answer. Can also be used for older children to perfect what they have learned.\nThe app is tested by teachers, what you can find below in references.\n\nteachingappz.co.uk:\"I had great fun playing with the app :-) Possible Classroom Uses: 1. Connect the device to a projector and use it to review basic addition skills. 2. Let children explore the app individually. How many levels can they complete successfully? 3. Use the app alongside practical equipment to support children’s counting and addition skills.\"\n\nbestappsforkids.org: \"1+1 is a fantastic math app for our little ones! It is based on a concept of repetition yet our kids will never notice as the colorful presentation and the constant positive reinforcement keeps them going! If they get a wrong answer there is a subtle sound and the problem will be repeated until it is apparent that they know the correct answer. You can reset the app back to new in the info page. This would be a great classroom and preschool app! This app is a great addition to your kid’s toolbox for life!\"\n\napps24h.com: \"1+1 is a great math app to practice math. It is simple and well designed to help kids learn all the required steps to deal with simple math. Fun Educational Apps would highly recommend to kids just starting learning about math.\"\n\nesparklearning.com: \"Your app 1+1 is included in our new curriculum, which is being rolled out to thousands of additional students this fall.\"\n\nkinderappgarten.de: \"1+1 is a useful tool for all parents with school starters or preschoolers who want to prepare for the first class.\"\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\nThe app is split in nine levels. In every level there are six equations, which the child has to solve.\nThe app is based on a modification of the Leitner system:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard\nThat means, the questions are repeated until the child gives the right answer. Thus, the answers will be incorporated into the memory. So it creates a real learning effect.\nIf child did all correct, the level is finished and in case, child got enough scores, next level will be opened. To get the third star, child has to play the level again.\nIn last level there will be asked many equations (around 40) again.\n\nRecommended for ages 5 - 8\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n'The 1+1 program is an adequate introduction in mathematical basic experiences and understanding for pre-school-age children and newcomers in school. \nThe design of the program enables them to do the lessons by their own. Children like the layout with the clear colors and shapes. \nAfter each lesson the program motivates the children by an encouragement. \nAs a headmaster with many years of experience I can give my best recommendations to the 1+1 program.'\n\nLudwig Hanisch, director primary school, Germany\n\n'The 1 + 1 program of the company creasoft is a by methodical / didactic aspects developed learning software for children of the first primary school class. It practices the addition in the numerical range to 10. Psychological aspects of learning were at the iphone/ipad - app considered and also a motivating, age-appropriate layout and intuitive operability.\nIn my view, the app is recommended as a complementary medium for learning and practicing very much.'\n\nJürgen Haller, director high school, specialized in edutainment, Germany\n\n'The very clear tasks of this educational game make fun!\nThey ask and encourage the concentration inconspicuous,\nbecause the joy of solving the tasks is in the foreground.\nThis successful combination leads to successful learning.'\n\nAnne Claßen, teacher primary school, Germany"

Download and play with your baby,\ntoddler or young children -- it's easy to learn and can entertain for hours.\n\nListen to the sounds made by both nature and machines. From boats, firetrucks, and\nhorse-drawn carriages to ducks, tigers, and birds. Each animal or object is like its own flash card; when opened, it plays a sound that is sure to stimulate each child and leave them with awe and wonder. This app is the perfect brain-trainer to help teach babies, toddlers, and children about sounds in the world.\n\nDo more than just give your kids a video to watch. Let them explore and learn with their senses. Parents of children with autism have found this app helpful in engaging their children, but truly it is for anyone that wants to teach their kids something new while stimulating and training their brains.\n\nEvery animal, transportation mode, and tile has five different sounds linked, so children can learn different sounds and images associated with objects. Trumpets, birds, harmonicas, planes, lions, and more; there are so many sounds and items for your toddler or baby to explore! They will love playing this app and you will love sharing the memory with them.\n\nAvailable in over 35 languages, this app is designed to teach anyone anywhere what sounds are and where they come from. Allow children of any age to explore by himself or herself, or with a parent, and to experience that joy of learning."

(from Wikipedia): \n“A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and power. It is composed of a semiconductor material with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals changes the current flowing through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be much more than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits.”\n\nThe transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic devices, and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems. Following its release in the early 1950s the transistor revolutionized the field of electronics, and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios, calculators, and computers, among other things.”\n\nWith Transistors Handbook you will se the design, the kind and all the aspects of more than 51.000 transistors, the application will provide the following info:\n- Kind\n- Graphical Schema\n- Code\n- Type\n- Material\n- Power\n- VCB\n- VCE\n- VEB\n- LC\n- FT\n- HFE\n- Note of the Transistor\n- Similar\n- Online Datasheet\n\nYou can also use the embedded search engine to search a transistor for its name or power.\n\nThe coverage of the transistors is about the complete catalogue of the Silicon and Germanium. \n\nThe series included are:, PNP and NPN, series 10 ~ 12, 14 ~ 19, 25 ~ 28, 2A ~ 2D, 2G, 2H, 2N, 2P, 2S, 2T, 30, 35, 37, 38, 3N, 3O, 3S, 3T, 40 ~ 43, 45, 4N, 50, 52, 55, 56, 5N, 60, 63, 6N, 71 ~ 74, 7N, 80, 81, 85, 90, 92, 94, A1, A5, A7, A8, AC, AD, AF, AJ ~ AM, AP, AR ~ AW, BC ~ BF, BJ, BL, BN, BP, BR ~ BV, C0 ~ C9, CA ~ CE, CG ~ CN, CP ~ CV, CX, D1 ~ D8, DA ~ DD, DH, DJ, DK, DM, DN, DP ~ DT, DW, DX, DZ, E1 ~ E3, E5 ~ E7, EA, EC, ED, EF, EJ, EL ~ EN, EQ ~ ET, EW, F1 ~ F5, FA ~ FH, FJ, FK, FM ~ FQ, FS, FT, FV, FX, FZ, G2, G6, GA ~ GF, GI, GM, GP, GS, GT, HA ~ HF, HK, HL, HN, HP, HS, HT, HV, HX, ID, IM, IN, IR, IT, J2, J4, J6, JA, JC, JE, JF, JO, K2, K4, K9, KD ~ KG, KM ~ KP, KR ~ KU, L4, L5, LB, LD, LI, LJ, LL ~ LP, LT, LX, M1, M2, MA ~ MH, MJ, MM ~ MU, MX, MZ, NA ~ NC, NJ, NK, NM, NP, NR ~ NT, NX, NZ, OC, OD, P2 ~ P4, P6, P7, P9, PB ~ PE, PH ~ PO, PR ~ PU, PX, PZ, Q, Q5, R3, R5, R7 ~ R9, RC, RE, RJ, RS, RT, RV, S0 ~ S2, S4 ~ S9, SA, SC ~ SH, SK, SM, SN, SP, SQ, SS, ST, SV, SX, SY, T0 ~ T3, TA, TB, TD ~ TF, TI, TK ~ TN, TP, TR, TS, TV, U2, UC, UM, UN, UP, V1, V2, V4, V7, W2, WT, XA ~ XC, XP, XQ, XS, ZB, ZD, ZG, ZH, ZT, ZU, ZX, with volts, frequencies, power, HFE (gain), similar transistors and pin design.\n\nThe list may not be exhaustive, if you find any transistor missing, let us know.\n\n*** Don't forget to check also our Mosfet Handbook application.

      "label": "Letter Quiz is the best way to learn the English Alphabet with over 10,000 copies being purchased by schools. Four different games for every stage of learning; flashcards, identification, matching and handwriting. Designed for kids but great for all ages.\n\n- What People Are Saying:\n\"I think this Letter Quiz is an awesome app.  I downloaded the free version and my son was begging for the full version. That's when you know its a good one.  So I downloaded the full version and he worked on his letters for an hour.  As a parent, I am so happy that he loves it and he is learning.\"\n\n\"My 2 year old daughter loves this app. Initially the app had only recognizing the alphabets now it also features writing. My daughter didn't have any interest to write alphabets on paper but when she saw the app, she learned to write in a few days. On the whole excellent app recommend the full version to all parents with little children.\"\n\n\nFour great games to develop your skills:\n\n- ABC Flashcards to get started recognizing letters\nThe uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter is shown on a card. Tapping on the card flips it over to reveal an object starting with the letter while a voice announces the letter and the objects. Use app settings to play in random order for a change of pace.\n\n- Letter Identification to test knowledge\nMultiple letters are shown on the screen and a voice requests you to touch a specific letter. If you touch the right letter, an object is shown starting with that letter, then it moves to the next letter. Get through all 26 letters and you win! Use app settings to play in random order or hide the hints to make the game more difficult.\n\n- Matching uppercase and lowercase letters\nThe top shows letters in uppercase. The bottom shows letters in lowercase. Draw a line between the two letters matching uppercase and lowercase to get to the next level. Enable random order in app settings for even more challenge.\n\n- Alphabet Tracing to practice handwriting\nEach letter is presented full screen with dotted lines shown to guide you through writing the letter. As you trace with your finger, fun sounds play along the line. After each letter is finished they are combined on a blackboard with your full alphabet. You can choose between uppercase and lowercase letters or play in random order by enabling them in the app settings. Complete all 26 letters to unlock the fireworks celebration with exploding letters and music! \n\nSpecial Features:\n- Universal app plays natively on iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch\n- Kid protected section for adjusting settings, no external links without a parent\n- Includes both Uppercase and Lowercase letters, enabled in settings\n- Localized for US and non US pronunciation for the letter Z (\"zed\" vs \"zee\")\n- Teacher mode allows parents to pick individual letters to trace, enabled in settings\n- Disable swiping to advance Flashcards for younger players\n\nConnect with us for feature suggestions or bug reports:\nOn the web: http://TantrumApps.com/contact\nOn Facebook: http://facebook.com/TantrumApps\nOn Twitter: http://twitter.com/TantrumApps"

      "label": "Open up the world-famous Peekaboo Barn, perfect for toddlers. \n\nInside the little bouncing barn, friendly farm animals are waiting to pop out and surprise your little one. Try and guess who they are; tap the doors to find out! More animals, animations, and sounds than ever.\n\nWork with your child to learn the names of animals and hear the sounds they make. Younger children will love opening the barn doors to find new animal animations, as they learn about cause and effect and become familiar with animal names and sounds. Older children will enjoy guessing animals by sound, then seeing the animal names, which helps develop early literacy skills.  \n\nMultiple Language Features:\n\nWe started with a child's voice in English. It's her real voice, which some kids really enjoy, but she does say \"wabbit\" and \"wooster.\" If this is a concern for you, you can switch to any of 12 adult voices; our adult narrators say everything clearly and perfectly, just like the teachers they are. You can try many languages from around the world—or record your own language, or grandma's voice. There are tons of ways to explore the languages of Peekaboo Barn!\n\nPress the Language button on the Options screen to try them out.\n\n—Choose from the built-in narrators: child's voice in young English; adult's voice in American English or Spanish.\n—World languages also included: Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, German, French, Australian, and UK English. \n—Record your own voice: We added this feature so parents, children, and visiting relatives and friends can capture their own voices and star in Peekaboo Barn.  Now you can record the animal names in your native language--or grandma's voice, or grandpa's--and, if you're recording a new language, you can save the appropriate written version too, and both will show up the next time you play. (Please note, we can only support the writing systems that are supported by your device.)\n\nFEATURED BY APPLE \nOne of the first apps to be released for toddlers, since 2008 Peekaboo Barn has been downloaded over a million times, and played over 100 million times worldwide.  It has been a top 20 educational game on the iTunes store nearly every day since its launch, and has been featured by Apple often.  It won The Best Toddler App Ever award in 2009, and was named one of the top 50 iPhone apps for kids by Babble.com in 2010 and 2011.  It is recommended by The New York Times, MSNBC, USA Today, Wired, Telegraph UK, Ireland’s The Independent, Parents Magazine, and the Washington Post.\n\nPeekaboo Barn was made for you and your toddler by artists and educators, not marketers, robots, or companies repackaging clip art. Our team has backgrounds in cognitive science and child development, and we’ve worked in educational media everywhere from Penguin USA to the Smithsonian Institution. When you could really use a safe distraction--in airports, restaurants, and waiting rooms--or you'd like to try something new with your little genius, Peekaboo Barn is the educational, artful solution. Enjoy! \n\nIf you are looking for more Peekaboo, check out our awesome cousins: Peekaboo Fridge, Peekaboo Forest, and Peekaboo Wild.\n\nIf your kids are ready for a more complex game with the same great characters, please try Peekaboo Barn Farm Day! Many activities to try: for example, you can milk the cow, shear the sheep and llama, and pet the animals to help them fall sleep.\n\nFollow us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/nightanddaystudios. \nTwitter: @nightdaystudios \nYour privacy is important to us!

      "label": "Do you enjoy watching videos on your iPhone? Do you hate not being able to because your iPhone cannot support the video format? Or do you hate the inconvenient and time-consuming hassle of trying to convert video formats to fit into one that your iPhone can support? \nThis is why the AVPlayer was created. The AVPlayer can play almost any computer video file format such as AVI, Xvid, WMV and much more clearly and effortlessly. No converting hassles. Just copy files via USB and just drag and drop into the AVPlayer’s Media Explorer. \nThe AVPlayer can also support external subtitle files such as SMI and SRT. So if you enjoy watching videos on your iPad, then the AVPlayer is an absolute necessity. \n\n• Support Formats\n- Dolby Digital (AC3), Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3)\n- Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- MP4,MOV,M4V\n- XVID,AVI,WMV,RMVB,ASF,H264,MKV… most of all movie file formats. \n- SMI, SRT, TXT, SubStationAlpha Subtitles \n\n• Post Processing \n- High quality video processing \n- Contrast,Saturation,Brightness \n- TV-Out \n\n• Control the playback speed (From 0.5X to 2.0X) \n- User setting support \n- Sweep to the left : move to backword 10 sec \n- Sweep to the right : move to forward 10 sec \n- Sweep to the top : 1.5X speed \n- Sweep to the down : normal speed \n\n• Additional features \n- Rotation Lock / Aspect ratio:auto/16:9/4:3/Full screen \n- Folder Management:Pass code/Move/Rename/Create \n- Resume play from last position \n- Scrubbing search \n- supports e-mail attachment by \"Open In\" feature \n\n• USB/WIFI Transfer \n\n• Note \n1. How to add video with USB \n- Run iTunes 9.1 or above \n- Device->My Device(My iPad)->Apps, drag and drop files to the AVplayer's documents \n\n2. Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal."

Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed! \n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children.

No joke this is the real deal and it is awesome.\" 4th Jul 2010\n\n \n\n \nCleverbot is Artificial Intelligence. It learns what people say, in context, and imitates.\n\nCleverbot says many things - claiming to be human, role-playing and much more. It may even say things you find inappropriate. Use with discretion and at your own risk.\n \nCleverbot is conversational entertainment - no more, no less. It is not made to be logical, give advice, or be useful. Parents must decide whether they wish young people to have access. Be sure of this, however: it is a bot. It is software. You will never talk to a human."

It was the first comic reader in the App Store, it’s still the best. \n\n• Organize your collection how YOU want. Put series inside series, use dividers to manage long lists.\n• Automatically sorts comics into their series.\n• Super fast reading view with two-page mode and assisted panning.\n• Page position lock so you don’t see the same borders page after page.\n• Does the right thing when you rotate your device, many comics have a mixture of portrait and landscape pages.\n• Lightning fast search, by comic title and tags.\n• Parental lock for individual series.\n\nIN APP PURCHASES\n\nFor a very reasonable price you can also unlock\n•  Comic Finders, create smart series that show you unread comics from all over your library.\n•  Seven new, gorgeous themes.\n\nCOMIC IMPORT \n\n• WI-Fi using a web browser on a PC or Mac.\n• Drop Box, iCloud Drive, etc using iOS document sharing.\n• AirDrop from a Mac.\n• iTunes via USB or Wi-FI\n\nTHE SLIDER\n\nComic Zeal features the innovative slider, it's a pointer, a container and a toolbox, all in one.  You can push stuff into it, then go anywhere in your collection and drag it out.  It's an incredibly fast way to organize your comics.\n\nWith the slider you can:\n\n• Reorder comics, put them into the slider in the order you want them, then drag them out.\n• Create reading lists (by making copies of comics that don't take up any space on your device)\n• Create series and dividers right in the app.  Dividers are lists that can hold comics, series and even other dividers.\n\nTIPS\n\n• Tap the ‘i’ info icon for comics, series and dividers. You can rename entries, sort a series or mark items as read or unread.\n• When zooming, hold the gesture for half a second.  Comic Zeal will lock that zoom and position when you turn the page, it's a great way to hide borders.  \n\nComics used in the screenshots:\n'Escape from Planet Nowhere',  © 2010 Otis Frampton, http://planet-nowhere.com/\n\nPlease note, there is a problem with Google Drive’s iOS extension that doesn’t allow you to open comic and other files that they consider to be ’non-standard’.  You can read more about it here: https://goo.gl/EKVRbN and here https://goo.gl/XXYRQI . You can open Comics from the Google Drive app itself using the 'Open in ...' option, just not directly from Comic Zeal."

Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science. While the periodic table in Toca Lab: Elements is accurate, the way new elements are created is not. Instead, it’s a fun way to experiment, discover and create curiosity in the world of science.

      "label": "This is the Original \"Spider on Hand\" app as seen on Youtube. Beware of imitations.\n\nDo you know anyone who is afraid of spiders? Everyone right? Then this is the perfect magic trick/prank for you.\n\nWatch the trailer video at http://www.mypetboris.com/trailer.htm\n\nMy Pet Boris app is the scariest app for the iPhone. Inspired by Jim Pace's magic trick \"The Web\" where a spider magically appears on the back of your spectator's hand. Bound to get amazing reactions.\n\nThe app uses the idea of \"Augmented Reality\" merging real life objects with computer generated graphics to create a truly frightening effect.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC SPIDER EFFFECT\nYou take a photo of the spectator's palm (secretly loading a plastic spider on the back of their hand) and place the phone on their palm to hold.\n\nYour Pet Boris - an Australian Red back spider (black widow) creeps onto the screen and they can feel the vibrations as it walks. You can tap the screen and even slide your finger into the animation to scratch the spider's back. Boris walks off the screen.\n\nYou tell them that the phone has special sensors that when you wave your hand over the screen it makes the spider come back. He does.\n\nYou get them to wave their hand over the phone. \nIt is just then that they glimpse a realistic spider clinging to the back of their hand and they FREAK OUT!!\n\nBound to get BIG reactions. \n\nFinger tone and size can be set to suit your own or you can import an image of your own finger. \n\nStart-up screen can be customised to suit your performance style. An actual  photo of their hand, solid white or any image from your library can be used as a background.\n\nNOTE: Requires a plastic spider or cockroach and adhesive dots to perform. You should be able to find these locally or you can purchase from our website.\n\nSee our website http://www.mypetboris.com for more details, spider and cockroach supplies and video presentation & instructions.\n\nLike our Facebook page to keep up to date with changes, tips and suggestions. http://www.facebook.com/MyPetBoris\n\n\nTHE MAGIC COCKROACH\nThe app also comes with a cockroach animation for those who think they are scarier than spiders.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC BUTTERFLY EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Butterfly is an additional effect within the Magic Spider – My Pet Boris App. \n\nIt is enabled as an “in app purchase” for around US$2.99 depending on your local currency. The custom finger feature is also unlocked when you purchase the butterfly effect.\n \nThis is a perfect routine for those times when you want to perform a beautiful effect for a little girl or woman, leaving her with a magical gift at the end. You will get similarly strong reactions to the Magic Spider effect without the scare factor.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe magician simulates a grand illusion in the palm of the spectator’s hand. A tiny foil covered “Magical Egg” is placed in the palm of the spectator’s hand and then photographed. The phone is placed on their hand.\n\nThe egg transforms into a Chrysalis and then into a butterfly. The magician’s finger is seen to tickle the virtual butterfly on screen which then flies away. \nUsing a magical gesture the magician brings the butterfly back briefly before it flies off again.\n\nThe spectator is asked to try and make it return. When they try, they find a matching butterfly (in an impossible location) on the back of their hand. The original foil egg has vanished.\n\nTHE CARD REVELATION EFFECT - IN-APP PURCHASE - (for the Professional Magician)\n\nThe Magic Spider effect with the addition of a torn card corner revelation as a finale.\n\nAccessory packs and supplies are available at: http://www.mypetboris.com/store.htm\n\nSee our FAQ Section. http://www.mypetboris.com/faq.htm\n\nFull instructions at: (everything is explained)\nhttp://www.mypetboris.com/inst2099.htm.\n\nUse the password at the bottom of the \"CREDITS\" screen for access."

      "label": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved"

      "label": "DRIVING BY RAIL\nIn \"Little Fox Train Adventures\", children can travel by train through enchanting landscapes and visit various places. At farms and factories, they help to load and unload the wagons, produce goods and deliver them to the next city. Lovely illustrations, fun animations and simple controls make the app suitable even for little children.\n\nBRING IN THE HARVEST AND LOAD THE TRAIN\nKids can bring in the harvest and load the train at over 10 different farms. They help to harvest fruit trees and vegetable fields, collect eggs from the chicken farm or milk the cows.\n\nTAKE YOUR HARVEST TO THE FACTORY\nThe harvest must now be taken to factories to process it. Whether it's carrot cupcakes, peach ice cream or socks made of alpaca wool - in over 20 factories, children can playfully learn about production processes, play an active part in them and trigger fun animations.\n\nSELL THE GOODS IN THE CITY\nAs soon as juice, cake or cheese have been loaded at the factory, the next stop will be the big city. The citizens are already waiting for new supply, so bring your goods to the supermarket quickly. But watch out for the gangster sheep, it wants to steal your goods!\n\nPERFECT FOR SMALL CHILDREN\nThe controls are very easy: By tapping you can harvest, load or accelerate the train. So even the younger ones can easily navigate through the app.\n\"Little Fox Train Adventures\" was illustrated by Karoline Pietrowski. With great attention to detail and the use of handmade textures and brushes, the scenes look like a picture book.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS:\n- Easy control, optimized for children between 2 and 5 years\n- Picturesque landscapes\n- Over 30 different stations\n- Funny characters and funny animations\n- Loving graphics and music\n- No internet or WiFi required - play wherever you want!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

      "label": "Get ready to rescue baby dinosaurs with Blaze and AJ in Blaze’s Dinosaur Egg Rescue Game!  \n\nThis iPhone app exposes preschoolers to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) concepts as they travel through Dino Valley with Blaze and AJ to find lost dinosaur eggs.\n\nThroughout the adventure, children are encouraged to develop problem-solving strategies and complete physics-based puzzles using water, bouncy balls and lasers to rescue dinosaur eggs from dangerous situations. Each location contains between one to three eggs, along with a hidden prehistoric gem!\n\nTOOLS: To rescue the dinosaur eggs, children are encouraged to manipulate the following tools and simple machines:\n-\tWheels\n-\tPulleys\n-\tCranks\n-\tLevers\n-\tMirrors (static and rotating)\n-\tSolar panels\n-\tPendulums\n\nCONCEPTS: In addition to experimenting with different tools, children are exposed to the following STEM concepts:\n-\tHeight (e.g. moving Blaze up or down to reach certain locations)\n-\tWeight (e.g. adding objects to a  bucket connected to a pulley)\n-\tTrajectory (e.g. manipulating the path of water, bouncy balls or a laser)\n-\tAdhesion (e.g. using a “sticky patch” to trap items and construct a path to complete the puzzle)\n\nHANDS-ON APPROACH TO LEARNING\nThis educational iPhone game for kids fosters a hands-on, experiential approach to STEM learning through critical-thinking challenges that enhance children’s understanding of physics puzzles and how things work. Kids learn with the help of their best friend Blaze - the coolest truck from the popular Nick Jr TV show!\n\nADDITIONAL GAME FEATURES\n-\t3 Blaze transformations – Blaze can shoot water, bouncy balls, or laser beams!\n-\tExplore three locations in Dino Valley and navigate different types of terrain – the jungle, rocky plateaus and a volcano!\n-\t45 levels – Solve forty-five physics puzzles to locate over 80 dinosaur eggs and a prehistoric gem on every level! \n\n\nBlaze and the Monster Machines Dinosaur Rescue collects personal user data as well as non-personal user data (including aggregated data).

It blasted to #1 on Christmas Day of that year and clinged to number one for weeks. It continued to linger in the Top Ten for over a year! \r\n\r\nWe can’t even tell you how much time it spent farting around at #2.\r\n\r\nThe App has been completely recoded and rebuilt for 2021.   \r\n\r\nHere are just a few of the useful, signature features of iFart®.\r\n\r\n* SECURITY FART *\r\n\r\nPhones and pdas are stolen on a daily basis, but if you are using iFart's advanced security system you can stop criminals right in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAnd when thieves try to snatch your phone, they'll be in for a shock when they're blasted by your chosen sound effect. Most criminals know how to lie, but \"it wasn't me\" isn't going to work with iFart.\r\n\r\nCall the authorities and send these phone stealing scumbags off to the gas chamber.\r\n\r\n* SNEAK ATTACK *\r\n\r\nThe sneak attack function can literally save your life. Let's say that you're in a warehouse gun battle. Bad guys are closing in on you, but if you only had a distraction, you could escape.\r\n\r\nSneak Attack is that distraction. Simply pull out your phone, choose a sound effect and set the timer up to 30 seconds. Then place your phone in a strategic location and move silently away.

For normal casual people who just want to mine for fun this app is perfect.  The app runs 4 worker threads to mine bitcoin blocks and you can view the apps logs as it works to find valid blocks.  \n\nYou won't become a bitcoin millionaire with pool mining because of the slow hash rate of CPU mining but you do have a chance of scoring big in solo mining If you are lucky enough to find a block.\n\nDownload the app and see for yourself what all the hype is about!"

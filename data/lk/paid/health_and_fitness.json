Check out Sync Solver - Health to Fitbit as well.\n\nData types supported:\n- Steps\n- Flights Climbed\n- Walking + Running Distance\n- Weight\n- Body Fat Percentage\n- Body Mass Index\n- Sleep Analysis (In bed and asleep time)\n- Water\n- Dietary Calories\n- Resting Calories\n- Active Calories\n\nNotes:\n- If you are using Sync Solver - Health to Fitbit, be sure to not sync the same data types as this will result in a data duplication loop.\n- Since iOS schedules backgroud updates based on your app usage pattern, it may be necessary to manually sync from time to time in order to keep Sync Solver automatically syncing on a consistent basis.\n- Intraday data granularity is not possible at this time due to Fitbit API limitations."

I've been trying to get into meditation for a while now and I've found other apps or videos I've tried have been repetitive or not very good. The meditations on here are so easy to follow and the app is very user friendly. I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too. I highly recommend whether you are a beginner or an experienced meditator. *****\n\nHERE TO HELP\nBuddhify is made by a values-led family business and we love hearing from you. Your feedback, suggestions and comments make all the hard work feel so worthwhile and makes the app better as we continue to make buddhify as effective, accessible and beautiful as it can be.

Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power"

      "label": "Cardiograph is an application which measures your heart rate. You can save your results for future reference, keep track of multiple people with individual profiles, add notes and locations, and even print out your measurements for sharing or safe keeping.\n\nCardiograph uses your device's built-in camera to take pictures of your fingertip and calculate your heart's rhythm - the same approach used by professional medical equipment!\n\n\"I know you have the disclaimer on the screen but I don't care, Cardiograph saved my life. Your app was key to understanding what was going on and help the doctors understand too.\"\nBob Spadafora - *****\n\n\"Comparing heart rates with family over the holidays is fun.\"\nTxyak – ****\n\n\"Wanna impress a friend with a cool app. This is the one to get.\"\nMattyray – *****\n\n\"After having two heart valve replacements and a by-pass, I feel it is not only smart - but also necessary - to have such a reliable heart rate monitor with me everywhere I go.\"\nDantv – *****\n\n\"I am an EMT and it helps me actually see what is going on. It is by no means definitive like a monitor but it is a great indicator of problems I would not see otherwise.\"\nGranniem – ****\n\n\"I had a pulse oximeter on one hand, medical quality, and my iPhone app in the other and the app was dead-on accurate.\"\nLike it but hate it – *****\n\n\n=== See Cardiograph in action ===\nhttp://macropinch.com/cardiograph \nhttp://youtu.be/isIjcCFYEho\n\n\n• Measure your heart rate\n\nIt's never been easier to know what your heart rate is! Without any external hardware, just using the built-in camera of your smartphone or tablet, you can get accurate readings almost instantly.\n\nKnowing how fast your heart is beating can be very useful when exercising, if you're under stress, if you have a heart-related medical condition, or even just out of curiosity.\n\n\n• Track your results\n\nEvery measurement you take is saved to your personal history, so you can keep track over time. In addition to the date and time of the measurement, you can also save the location at which it was taken (and see them on a map), and even add a quick note to effortlessly organize your history.\n\n\n• Multiple profiles\n\nCardiograph is perfectly tailored to allow multiple people to use the app on a shared device. You can create profiles for each of your family members or friends, and each of them has their own individual measurement history.\n\n\n• Export & Print\n\nEach measurement can be exported in full detail to a portable format that you can later send via e-mail, upload on the web or even print right from the app itself (with an AirPrint™ compatible printer).\n\n\n• Clean and intuitive design\n \nInspired by real-life medical equipment, Cardiograph is a pleasure to use. The streamlined and clutter-free design makes it seem instantly familiar, so you can focus on using the app instead of navigating through series of confusing screens.\n\n\n• Built-in user guide\n\nIf you're having trouble with the app, or you want to make the most out of it, you can access the comprehensive help manual right from within the app itself.\n\n\n• Universal application with iCloud® sync\n\nCardiograph is an universal application - it runs on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod touch.\nInstall Cardiograph on multiple devices with iOS 5.0+, and all your profiles and measurements will be in sync! Manage your profiles and measurements on one device, and the changes are instantly reflected on all the others.\n\n\nPlease note: If your device doesn't have a built-in camera flash, you need to take your measurements in a well lit environment (bright sunlight or close to a light source).\n\n\nFollow the latest news:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/macropinch \nhttp://twitter.com/macropinch"

For long-term health it is recommended that we take approx. 10,000 steps a day. For successful weight loss, daily steps should amount to 12,000-15,000.\n\nTo get started using iSteps, set up your personal profile by entering your height in cm or inches, your weight in lbs or kg, and choose how you want your results displayed, either in kcal or kJ and distance in miles or km. Then press the START button and you are ready to GO! \n\nWe recommend that you wear your iPhone or iPod touch by your waist or in your pocket, but you may need to experiment a bit to find the best location for optimal accuracy. \n\nPlease note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. With the option to turn off “Daily Totals Tracking”, you can save battery when needed."

      "label": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important."

She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen.\n\nYou will get fit - or else.\n\n---\n\n7 Minutes in Hell Workout\nEmploying SCIENCE™ to compact an hours-long workout program into just 7 sweat-and-pop-culture-soaked minutes, CARROT will train you personally on exercises like Mt. Doom Climbs, Celebrity Face Punches, and Dragon Mating Dances. \n\nYou get 30 seconds for each of the 12 punishing exercises,* with 10 seconds of rest in between just in case you need to hydrate, catch your breath, or vomit into a bucket.\n\nThis diabolical interval workout can be completed anywhere, at any time, so you have no excuse not to be in fighting shape when the Robopocalypse begins.\n\n*12 additional exercises can be unlocked via in-app purchase.\n\n---\n\nLose (or Gain) Weight In Style\nAre you ready to have so much fun tracking your weight that you'll actually look forward to hopping on your scale? All you have to do is punch in your current weight, then sit back and let CARROT pass judgment upon you.\n\nWARNING: If you blimp up or slim down too much, CARROT will be upset. When CARROT is upset, she gets mean. When CARROT gets mean, there is a 74.9% chance that she will make you cry.\n\n---\n\nClaim Your Rewards\nIf you work out and slough off those extra pounds, CARROT will reward you with fabulous prizes like app upgrades, cat facts, and permission to watch your friend eat a bag of potato chips.\n\nTrack Your Awesomeness \nBecause math is hard, CARROT will do all the number-crunching for you. See how many steps you've taken today, chart your weight loss on a pretty graph, view your workouts on a calendar, and more!\n\nAnd because CARROT syncs with Apple's Health app, she can save your weight and workout data to the HealthKit database. She can also monitor fitness activity logged with other HealthKit-compatible apps, even when you're not actively using her.\n\n---\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Work out with a hilarious AI construct\n- Enjoy 3+ hours of spoken tips, encouragement, and ridicule\n- Travel through time, protect your property from hobos, and appease an elder god in 12 original, never-before-seen exercises\n- Get 12 additional exercises via in-app purchase\n- Apple Watch app works as a heads-up display for your workout\n- Record your weight up to once a day\n- Bond with your cute & cuddly meatbag avatar\n- Level up and unlock rewards for getting fit\n- Set reminders so you'll never forget a workout\n- Track your weight progress on a pretty graph\n- Set a goal weight that you'll likely never meet\n- See how many steps you've taken today\n- Check your BMI to determine if you're still obese\n- Sync data with Apple's Health app\n\nDon't make CARROT angry.

This App supports all complications, so make your Apple watch a real Fitness Gadget!!\n\nHow to Use:\n-\tATTENTION: Oxygen Saturation only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 6, because this Apple Watch has the sensor you need to measure your oxygen saturation.\n-\tThe app needs to connect with the Apple’s Health app to display the recorded data on your Apple Watch, as complication or your Iphone.\n-\tUsing iOS 14 you can add a Widget to your home screen on your IPhone to display the latest measurement.\n- In case you are still not receiving any data, please open your Apple Health App and check if it is able to measure your oxygen saturation."

Everyone's got their own taste in workout music.  That's why the app plays YOUR music from YOUR iTunes library.\n\n** It's here to help. **\n\nNeed a speed boost while you're running?  Just press the speed buttons in the app.  Cooling down? Press the down arrow.\n\nGot a song that helps get you going?  Set it as a \"Pump Up Song\" and you can play it when you need it the most.\n\n** It's super smart. **\n\nThe app learns which songs you don't like while running & it stops playing them.  Simple as that.\n\nWant more control?  You can also set a blacklist of songs that you don't ever want the jog.fm app to play.\n\nIf you love a song, you can flag it during or after your run and it'll be played more often.\n\n** It plays nice. **\n\nDo you use other fitness apps like RunKeeper or Nike+ (in \"outdoor\" mode)?  Just launch the other fitness app first, then launch jog.fm.  Works like a charm.\n\nIn Nike+, make sure you go to \"Settings\" and be sure to turn off \"Music Tied to Run Controls\"\n\n\n** Please Note **\n\nThe jog.fm app must remain on top with the screen on while running.  \n\nDo not turn your screen off while running.\n\nThis app is not a streaming service.  It plays music from your iTunes library.\n\nThere is a one-time setup that will take about one minute (depending on the size of your library).  The app needs to analyze your songs to figure out which ones to play.  An internet connection (WiFi recommended) is required for this setup step because the app is powered by the Echo Nest.\n\nThis app is not yet compatible with iTunes Match.  It'll work, but you may find some long gaps between songs.  \n\nThis app is for running or walking.  We are working on adding more workouts soon!\n\nPlease do not run or walk in traffic."

      "label": "The CycleBeads app enables you to plan or prevent pregnancy easily and effectively by simply tracking your period each cycle. Just enter the date your period starts, and the app identifies your fertile and non-fertile days according to the patented Standard Days Method®. \n\nRESEARCH\nThis modern natural family planning method has been researched extensively in medical trials and is the only proven family planning method which allows you to manage your fertility simply by tracking your period. iCycleBeads is the only iPhone app in the world based on this method. It has been found to be 95% effective in perfect use and 88% effective in typical use.*\n\nCRITERIA FOR USE\nThe one medical criterion for using this method effectively is that you should have cycles between 26 and 32 days long**. Most women do, but not all. If you are unsure if your cycle is in this range, the CycleBeads app can be used to track your cycle lengths and will let you know if your cycles are in this range. \n\nYou can also take a self-screener at: www.cyclebeads.com/screen \n\nHOW TO USE\nTo use iCycleBeads, simply input the date your most recent period started. The app immediately lets you know what day of your cycle you are on, whether it is a potentially fertile day or an infertile day, and when your fertile days will occur this cycle, all based on the Standard Days Method. You can use this information to either plan pregnancy, avoid pregnancy, or just to track.  This information is provided in both a calendar format and in a visual representation of Cycle Beads.  \n\nKEY FEATURES:\n•A visual representations of your cycle based on the start date of your period in both calendar and CycleBeads formats\n•Customizable alerts notifying you when you are on your fertile days, when your fertile window is ending, and when you are likely to start your next period \n•Alerts reminding you to input your period start date or when you had a cycle outside the range of 26-32 days long\n•A notes feature which allows you to track key information that you may want to discuss with your health provider\n•Ongoing cycle data history so you can see the start dates of your previous cycles, the length of each cycle, and whether that cycle was in the range for using this method effectively.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\nFor more information on the research behind this family planning method, to watch a video on how it works, or to learn more about this family planning tool, visit www.CycleBeads.com \n\nMillions of women around the world have used this method as birth control, to plan pregnancies, or just to better understand their cycles. A portion of the proceeds from sales of all CycleBeads products including the iCycleBeads app, supports research to expand family planning options around the world, and help people make informed choices about their reproductive health. \n\nWe update iCycleBeads regularly. Please send us any feedback or requests for improvements to info@cyclebeads.com. \n\niCycleBeads is protected under patent. \n\nSources: \n* Arevalo M. et al., Contraception, 2002;65;333-338. \n** According to data from the World Health Organization and analyzed by researchers at Georgetown University, approximately 80% of cycles are in the 26-32 day range."

All trackable from within Sleep Pulse 3!\n\nwatchOS 6\n• Bold Design, the app opens to your last sleep report with your sleep goal, sleep analysis, heart rate, and motion. The new Sleep Goal Ring and Analysis Donut Ring can be tapped for additional information.\n• Sleep View, designed to provide context while you sleep including when you went to bed, how long you have been in bed for, and your live heart rate.\n• Resting Heart Rate, upon wake your resting heart rate will be measured — a good measurement of your overall health.\n• Sensitivity Level, because we all sleep differently and in different places (cars, boats, planes, camping etc) the sensitivity level for analyzing your sleep may be adjusted from the watch app.\n• Complication Support, for best use add Sleep Pulse 3 to your watch face with a complication and see how much of your sleep goal you complete each night.\n• iPhone Independent, away from your iPhone for a night? No problem Sleep Pulse 3 analyzes your full sleep without your iPhone, when connected it will sync the data. Get your sleep report directly on your Apple Watch.\n\niOS 13\n• Bold Look, Designed to provide a cleaner and clearer look at your sleep with vibrant colors, haptics, large text, sleep ring and sleep analysis charts.\n• Sleep Metrics, metrics to explain your sleep include: Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, Restless, Slept Duration, In Bed, Fell Asleep, REM Estimate, Night Steps, Resting Heart Rate, Fell Asleep Heart Rate, Range of Heart Rate, Mode Heart Rate, Average Heart Rate\n• Analysis Charts, see a breakdown ratio of how you slept on the sleep analysis donut chart. Also see detail of the type of motion that occurred during your sleep on the motion analysis donut chart.\n• Track Trends, track Fell Asleep Duration, Slept Duration, and your Resting Heart Rate changes\n• Power Nap Add On, with the \"Power Nap with Health Sync\" app installed on your device you can now save and track your daily nap durations in Sleep Pulse.\n• Sleep Talk Add On, to provide you with potential sleep talk recordings from your night — View the app \"Sleep Talk\" for more info. \n• Sleep Wake Mood, save your sleep mood to the sleep report\n\nBecause our sleep is more complicated than just our heart rate, our movement is also part of the picture. \"Auto track\" apps don't use motion, as it is something that needs to be processed directly, not in the background on watchOS**.\n\nHealthKit is used to save your sleep data to the Health app on your iPhone.\n\nwatchOS 5 and iOS 12 are required for use.\n\n*Extra purchases required, discounts through the Sleep Better with Watch Bundle*\n\n**Sleep must be started when In Bed, and not before each night, Sleep Pulse's algorithm tracks only sleep and any attempt to try and \"auto track\" your sleep before being In Bed will provide inaccurate results of your sleep. » Sleep Pulse 3 has no alarm or auto track function, SLEEP MUST BE MANUALLY STARTED WHEN YOU ARE IN BED and stopped from the watch (allows for the most accurate analysis, and fell asleep time), any other app that claims it accurately tracks your sleep automatically with motion is falsely claiming that feature. watchOS 6 requires motion be manually started and stopped — then processed with the app active**\n\nSLEEP PULSE 3 MOTION IS NOT FOR MEDICAL USE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, OR MONITOR ANY MEDICAL CONDITION. CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR WITH ANY QUESTIONS.\n\nSources: Visit Support for Source Info\n\nApp Preview Music Credit:\nCheery Monday Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons"

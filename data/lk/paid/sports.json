Determining the solunar period is therefore useful for activities such as birdwatching, fishing or hunting. There are two major and two minor solunar periods each day. The time at which each solunar occurs varies depending on the date and on your geographical location.\n\nThe app helps you to determine the solunar period and expected animal activity index (where 6-point is when animals are most active). It also tells you the exact sunrise, sunset, sun transit, moon rise, moon set, and moon transit times, alone with moon phase. The app can utilize your iPhone's build-in GPS to obtain your geographical location. In case you are using iTouch or without GPS signal, the app also accepts user input of longitude and latitude. \n\n\nFEATURES:\n.Locations: GPS or Manual Entry\n.Major & Minor Periods\n.Activity Index\n.Moonrise / Moonset Times\n.Moon Phase Data\n.Sunrise / Sunset Times\n.Sun Transit\n.Moon Transit\n.Day / Week View\n.Any Date\n.Any Location - Worldwide\n\nNo network is needed. You can have it anywhere, anytime! This is the most stable and reliable solunar table app."

The app gives you duration, distance, speed and altitude as well as your exact position and track lines on a map while tracking.\n\nThe web site stores your tracks in an archive under your account that enables you to log in and view and edit your tracks. Using the app, you can be as anonymous as you like since you track under an Alias, and you can even set the tracks to be private (not listed or searchable on locatoweb.com). \n\nThe app only records your position when a track has been set up and started and lasts until you stop it. It is frequently used to track bicycle rides, road trips, hiking trips and other outdoor adventures where you want to show your friends and family where you are, or to simply track your adventures for your own pleasure.\n\nThere is also a safety aspect of using LocaToWeb. If you have the track running and something happens, your wife, husband and friends can see the exact location of where you are. Maybe you are riding your bike and falls off hitting your head, or you just want to be safe when walking home alone at night. \n\nKey features:\n\n- Share your position to web in real time\n- Monitor duration, distance, speed and altitude\n- See your exact position and track line on a map\n- Capture and upload photos while tracking\n- Set up race groups that tracks several participants\n- Choose your units system (metric/imperial)\n- Possible to keep the screen alive while tracking\n- Resume a track that has been stopped\n- View and edit your archived tracks anytime on the web site\n- Just install and track, no registering is required\n\nNote that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

By freedivers, for freedivers, our freedive apnea trainer helps you with static apnea tables and lung capacity training so you can effectively increase the time when diving underwater.\r\nSee why STAmina Apnea Trainer is one of the best apnea apps to improve the breath-holding time for freediving, scuba diving and spearfishing, as well as surfing, running, and other water sports with 6 different apnea tables types.\n\n\r\n■ FREEDIVING & SPEARFISHING APNEA TRAINER FEATURES:\n\n\r\n◉ 6 APNEA TABLE OPTIONS \r\nSTAmina Apnea Trainer can create / generate custom apnea (exercises that are automatically created based on the maximum breath-hold and match the user’s level) or let you select from the following customizable table types:\r\n\r\n- O2 deprivation table – accustoms a body to lower oxygen levels. This is achieved by increasing the amount of time that you hold your breath on each attempt, while the resting time is fixed.\r\n\r\n- CO2 Tolerance table – helps a body to adapt to high carbon dioxide levels. This is achieved by decreasing the length of resting time between fixed breath-hold periods.\r\n\r\n- Wonka table – a variation of CO2 tables. Apnea timer starts after the first contraction, the rest time takes one breath.\r\n\r\n- Mix table – tables where apnea time increases and rest time decreases with each round.\r\n\r\n- Custom table – allows mixing of different approaches to create a custom training, thus generating the most effective training program.\r\n\r\n- Pranayama – a breathing technique to decrease stress in the body and relax the nervous system.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ APPLE HEALTH SYNCRONIZATION \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED TRAINING WITH VARYING DIFFICULTY\r\nWhen you start working with the application, you set your personal record in breath holding. Based on this data, the app will offer a personalized training program with exercises of 3 difficulty levels to choose from: easy, normal, and hard.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONALIZED EXERCISE SETTINGS \r\nEach exercise can be edited by setting your own number of repetitions, breath hold time, rest time, etc.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ TRAINING REMINDERS \r\nGet the notification to start your apnea training. Set a reminder in the apnea diver app for the day and the time & get a notification to do a breath holding training session.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ PERSONAL STATISTICS AND DETAILED TRAINING HISTORY\r\nAll your workouts and exercises are recorded in the freedive trainer app to track the detailed progress of each training.\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ VOICE GUIDANCE\r\nTraining may be accompanied by voice guidance with male/female voices recorded by professional voice actors. STAmina supports English, French, Russian voice guidance.\r\n\r\n\n\n\r\n◉ HEART RATE AND OXYGEN SATURATION TRACKING\r\nTrack your heart rate while doing breath holding exercises (a compatible HR monitor or pulse-oximeter is required) \n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CONTRACTIONS TRACKING \r\nUse our freedive trainer to track unlimited contractions, analyse captured data after exercises\n\n\r\n\r\n◉ CLOUD SYNC / BACKUP\r\nAccess your data on multiple devices and easily restore it in case you switch devices/phones.\n\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\nStamina Apnea Trainer allows training breath hold effectively for anyone who cares about all kinds of diving including:\r\n> beginner or professional freedivers;\r\nspearfishers;\r\n> scuba divers to learn how to dive longer on one tank;\r\n> surfers in case of unexpected breath hold;\r\n> underwater sports athletes such as underwater rugby, hockey, etc.\r\n> runners who want to train breath holding & high tolerance to CO2 while running\r\n\r\n_______\r\nInfo https://getstamina.app/\r\nContact https://www.facebook.com/staminamobile/\r\nSupport hello@squarecrowdapps.com"

      "label": "Mobile App \"RallyPacenotes\" (www.rallypacenotesapp.com) is designed to be the best aid for rally drivers (section \"Driver\") and rally codrivers (\"Co-driver\" section).\n\nThe application was created by Miguel E. Susunaga Valencia (migSVapps.com), from the original idea of Raúl Belategui and with the sports advice of David Nafría. Its effectiveness and usefulness have been contrasted in the pacenotes courses TheRallyDriver.com for drivers.\n\n\n\"Driver\" section:\n\nThe \"Driver\" section is designed to help rally drivers in the difficult task of doing special stages pacenotes. The app allows teams to write down the intensity of each corner using the steering wheel angle rotation. The numbering of each corner, \"8\", \"3+\", \"120\" or any other information that each pilot uses in its pacenotes system, is fully configurable, as well as the strip of degrees in which it must show the Information.\n\nThe application is designed to be used in the first “recce” run, which is performed at low speed, for this reason and because a high speed can affect the sensor measurement, the corner numbering is shown only when the speed is less than 80 km/h.\n\nIn addition to intensity, the application also helps us calculate the distances between corners using GPS signal. The driver has up to 3 different trips. One “partial”, another “total” and even a third specially designed to measure the corner’s lengths.\n\nIt also shows us the current speed of the vehicle. Something that is especially useful in those recces in which the speed is limited and controlled by the organization. The driver can set at what speed he wants to receive an alert so as not to exceed that limit. Two different speeds can be set with their respective alerts.\n\n\n\"Codriver\" section:\n\nThe \"Codriver\" section is divided into 3 screens. The first offers codrivers the tools necessary to facilitate the management of times and distances between time controls. It allows to calculate the time of entry in the following time control, it shows the real time, the time remaining until the next time control and 3 trips (regressive, partial and Total) that calculate the distances by means of GPS. It also shows the current speed of the vehicle (obtained by GPS), which will be of great help especially those cars that do not have a speedometer to not exceed the speed limits in the road sections.\n\nThe second screen helps us in the special stages. It has a chronometer with different starting possibilities. Allows to save and compare splits between the different runs by the same special stage. And it also has a total trip and a regressive one.\n\nA third screen helps us to calculate a forecast of the fuel consumption until the next refuelling, distinguishing between kilometers and consumptions of road section and special stages."

      "label": "Mobile Golf Tempo Training App allows any golfer to mimic the swing of the Pros, improving distance and accuracy, potentially making the need for bunkers obsolete!\n\nMobile Golf Tempo is the best way to master long and short game with a smooth swing rhythm as well as putting distance control.  \n\nProfessional golfers regularly work their tempo so why not you?\n\nTeaching pros agree that consistent tempo is an important aspect of the golf swing. A very slow tempo is something golfers of all levels should avoid. This app allows golfers to establish the tempo of the tour pros and a fluid rhythm in order to add length to their shots, consistency across their game and distance control.\n\nThe “Swing ratio” is the time it takes to complete the backswing as compared to the downswing. A swing ratio of 3:1 means the backswing is three times as long as the downswing. This swing ratio can vary across club selection or shot type. For example, many touring pros use a swing ratio of 3:1 for their driver with a ratio of 2.1:1 when making their putts. \n\nBy simply reacting to visual, audial or vibrational signals delivered through your iPhone, you can begin your backswing, start your downswing, and make impact with the golf ball at precisely the correct tempo and timing. It’s just that simple!\n\nThere is even and optional additional tone for golfers who utilize a swing trigger (any kind of move that takes place just before golfers start their swing) in their game. \nVisit our blog at http://www.mobile-golf-tempo.com/blog-in-english/ to learn to control distance in short game using Mobile Golf Tempo.\n\nFor the demanding golfers, Mobile Golf Tempo allows them to change all parameters of the tempo.\n\nFeatures:\n* Simple and advanced mode\n* Possibility to create a WAV file containing audio sequences from your tempo to be played by your iPod mini for example\n* The only tempo app fully configurable that allows slow tempo (useful for senior players) as well as extremely fast tempo like the faster pros on tour, and all in between \n* One of the only tempo apps that allows you to break rules and experiment all you want: swing ratio can be changed from 1.00:1 to 4.25:1 \n* Opportunity to have different tempos for each club (including the putter)\n* Tempo is expressed in different ways, one of which is textual (too slow, slow, relax, animated, lively, fast, very fast, explosive and too fast)\n* 7 preset tempos corresponding to the majority of touring pros\n* Ability to adjust the human reaction time to the sound. So, you only have to react to the tones\n* Ability to take into account the time of a possible swing trigger (ritual)\n* Animation of the swing (driver, iron, full swing wedge, ¾ swing wedge, ½ swing wedge, ¼ swing wedges and putter), right-handed and left-handed. The movement of the golfer reflects your settings (e.g. the swing trigger and the human reaction time to sound).\n* Possibility to select a random time between the sound sequences\n* Metronome\n* Vibrate mode\n* Compatible with the Suunto G6 watch\n* Languages: French, English and Spanish\n* Train your tempo memory\n* Learning mode\n* Offline documentation with technical advices\n\nIf you're not getting sound from Mobile Golf Tempo App,  please check the \"Mute\" side switch located near the volume button. \n\nThe reason why some apps (like Music) played sound and others didn't is because individual iOS apps can decide whether their audio should play regardless of the mute switch state. \n\nMany golf clubs prohibit the sounds of phones, and that's why the sound of Mobile Golf Tempo app does not play when you use side switch to mute the phone.  This is a normal and standard feature, so please don't write negative comments for something that's absolutely logical!"

Each time you hit the split button or volume buttons, the app will record the time and save a picture of the athlete with a convenient banner that includes the time.\n\nThis app can be used for sports where a lot of people finish at the same time making it difficult to get the time and the names of the athletes who crossed the finish line. For example in cross country, using StopWatch + Camera, you will be able to get the time and the picture of the athlete!\n\nThe banner included in the photo is fully customizable, where besides the time, you can show or hide the name of the event, details about the moment and also the name of the athlete. The pictures are saved in your camera roll and the splits can be sent by email and also in the different social networks apps. \n\nFeatures: \n\n-Pictures, including a banner with the time, are saved to an album of the camera roll.\n-Lap button records the split and simultaneously takes the picture. \n-Like the regular iPhone camera, volume buttons take the picture and record the split as well.\n-The stop button, besides to stop the stopwatch, also takes a picture.\n-Missed the gun?. Don't worry, you can predefine the start time of the timer. \n-The splits can be seen during and after the event.\n-The splits and final time can be sent by email and social network apps\n-Fully customizable banner appears in the pictures showing the time, name of the event, and more details."

An associated car number can optionally be recorded as well. Log entries can be reviewed by scrolling the screen and individual log entries may be deleted. The clock can be dynamically changed to record in seconds, tenths of a second, or hundredths of a minute (decimal minutes). A facility is provided to adjust the time of day clock independently of the devices clock so that the app can be synchronized to an external time reference without changing the device's clock.\n\n*** Note ***\nThe accuracy of the clock over time, sometimes called drift, depends on the accuracy of the underlying hardware."

Recreational dive planners are decompression tables in which non-stop time under water is calculated. The Dive Planner can be used to practice for your dive certification exams, and can be used as a general guide for planning dives, and logging your dives so you never forget what to enter into your paper log book. \n\nDive Plan works for diving with air (21% Oxygen) filled tanks, as well as enriched air (nitrox from 21% to 40% oxygen). Please note that when diving on an altitude, special considerations must be taken into account, and different dive tables should be used.\n\nDive computers use much more sophisticated algorithms for calculated non-decmpression limits, based on the whole dive, whereas the recreational dive tables are much more conservative and assume a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth."

      "label": "The 'YO YO Endurance Test' provides an important instrument for determining the level of physical efficiency of an athlete.\nThe physical capacity is evaluated quickly and easily by placing two cones spaced 20 meters each other.\nThe athlete has to run at full speed from one cone to another and then return again on the first cone. This path must be repeated for six times without any break, and get  the split times every time the athlete passes on the first cone.\n\nThis application will track all the split time and at the end will be calculated two parameters that determine the outcome of the test. More these values are low and better will be the athlete's performance.\n\nBasically the final result is given by a mathematical formula that processes the delta between the averages of the last two split times and the first two split times  and thereby the athlete's ability to maintain its maximum speed for a certain period of time.\n\nThe second value obtained on completion of the test, is the first result considering also the total time of the test.\n\nThe 'YO YO Endurance Test' can be used to determine the level of athletic in all sports (football, running, basketball, volleyball, cycling, tennis etc.)\nAt the end of the test you can get for each athlete the final result (eg. \"Above average\" or \"Poor\") and the Vo2Max estimate\n\nYou can manage more Athletes and save personal data and notes.\nYou can analyze test results.\nAutomatic Sync between devices thanks to iCloud\nInfo section where you can better understand how prepare the test and you can visit linked website and video where get more info about YO-YO Endurance Test\n\nIf you find this application useful, please give a positive review in the AppStore, so we can further improve and develop new options.\n\nFor any further information, please send an email to:\nsupport@bitandweb.com\n\nThanks"

Wouldn’t it be great to be able to dive deeply with one big breath and take incredible pictures for your friends at home? The Apnea Trainer makes it possible! By using it to train three times a week, you can quickly double your underwater time.\n\nThis is the same training principle used by apnea divers. It’s based on a yoga technique which strengthens the diaphragm muscles allowing you to fill your lungs with more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide while exhaling. The system is relatively simple and depends on finding the right time intervals which are provided by the program, thus letting you relax and concentrate on your breathing. This will guarantee maximum training success.\nThe program will also come in handy just before the actual dive since a pranayama mode is already included. The Apnea Trainer will help you keep your whole body calm and give you the perfect preparation for those amazing, long-lasting dives. \n\n\nFeatures:\n+ Training to improve free diving time\n\n+ Pranayama mode to calm your body before diving or snorkeling\n\n+ Custom time settings for pro divers\n\n+ Optical and Audio instructions\n\n+ Easy to use interface\n\nUpdated user interface with the help of Bjoern Maser by www.minimalist.ch."

      "label": "'TSD Rally' was designed to help the pilots to respect the imposed average speeds during regularity rallying, also known as TSD rallying (Time, Speed and Distance).\n\n'TSD Rally' allows you to control your advance or delay with 3 modes:\n  - Odometer mode: The application displays in real time the theoretical distance to run to keep the imposed average speed. It's exactly like the AVG SPEED PROFESSIONAL CHRONOMETER hardware which costs 499$ !\n\n  - Manual mode: In this mode the co-pilot must tap the screen each time a predefined distance is traveled (100 meters by default). The application then refresh in real time:\n . The real average speed on the current section.\n . The real delta time on the entire race.\n . The real delta distance on the entire race.\n\n - GPS Mode: In this mode the real time and distance calculation is automatic. We strongly recommend that you use this mode with an external bluetooth gps module like the Duo one for exemple.\n\n'TSD Rally' also provides you:\n* An average table to enter the imposed averages by section.\n* An access to google maps to visualize your race (deceleration zone are drawn in blue, acceleration in red).\n* A summary of your results with the statistics by section (acceleration, max speed, delta time and distance).\n* A real time graphical accelerometer.\n* A lot of settings to make 'TSD Rally' fit all your needs.\n\nAll the results, statistics plus the map of the race can be saved and sent by email. \n'TSD Rally' will become your ideal race partner !\n\nDon't hesitate, give it a try with the free lite version, limited to 3 kms.\n\nWarning:\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Don't forget to stop the application when rally is finished."

      "label": "It's all about time. The distance you travel at prescribed speeds determines the time it will take to move along each leg or segment of the rally course.\n\nThe goal is to arrive at each checkpoint with the least amount of error in time, either ahead or behind. The team with the fewest penalty points (seconds or hundredths of a minute early or late at checkpoints) wins.  To help you along the way, course instructions set out the speeds, distances, or times between points where changes to one or two of these variables must be made. \n\nThis app allows you to compute the ideal time to cover a particular distance at a particular speed, to add that time to one of two clocks A or B, and then to toggle between the clocks for each leg of the rally while recording the cumulative error as you go.\n\nIn the special situation where the Distance = 1.00, the app will change its functionality to the \"Split mode\" where you can incrementally add or subtract distances of 1.0 or 0.1 miles or kilometers. Many rally teams monitor progress along the rally course this way. By manually incrementing the distance each mile elapsed since the start of a leg, for example, the Ideal Time and the Cumulative Error will increment simultaneously.\nWhether you choose to compute Time, Speed, or Distance, the unknown factor can be computed from a combination of the other two. Additionally, you may add or subtract time from the Ideal Time using the adjustment options on the pop-up below the Speed input.\n\nThe time and distance measurements can be set to seconds or decimal minutes (cents) and to miles or kilometers in the app Settings."

      "label": "Calculate gearing easily on a borrowed boat | Simply enter your rig and “New Boat, Which Oars” will set your standard gearing on any borrowed boat | Perfect for rowers and coaches |\nForget gearing-related stress, download now!\n\n\"Decent Rowing is the most comprehensive and thoughtfully produced online guide to rowing to date\"\n(Bryan Kitch, 2013)\n\n“New Boat, Which Oars” is the first app from Decent Rowing, the world’s most comprehensive online guide to rowing. Gearing is something that we all struggle with –too often we’ve offered a sympathy to embarrassed coaches who, under regatta pressure, haven’t set the right gearing for their athletes in a borrowed boat. We too learnt the hard way, and there’s no worse feeling as a coach than getting the gearing wrong!\n\n“New Boat, Which Oars” helps you make gearing changes quickly and confidentially. Here’s how it works:\n• \tThe app will ask you for your standard rig (oar length, inboard length, span/spread)\n• \tYour standard gearing will then be calculated\n• \tYou can then enter any dimension (oar length, inboard length, span/spread) from a borrowed boat, and the app will calculate your other dimensions to achieve your normal gearing\n\nThe app also has a “gearing 101” slideshow, and a help section.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nSally normally rows (285|89|159). i.e., \n• \tOar length: 285cm\n•\t Inboard: 89cm\n•\t Span: 159cm\nThe app calculates Sally’s normal gearing. It is 2.05.\n\nUnfortunately her normal boat is unavailable. An hour before her heat, she is offered a boat with a span of 160cm. Sally quickly enters “160cm” into the app, which instantly suggests an oar length of 286.5cm, and inboard length of 89.5cm. She is able to make the changes and complete her heat with her normal gearing."

Using temperature, altitude, humidity, atmospheric pressure and oil-mix ratio, the app will show you a recommendation about jetting to your specific bike, so it can be useful to get a spot-on configuration and adapt it to the weather changes.\n\nIn order to get the weather values, the application can use the GPS to obtain the position and altitude, and the network connection to get the temperature, pressure and humidity from the nearest weather station. Nevertheless, the application can run without GPS and internet connection, in this case, the user has to give the altitude and weather data.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n- Results: in this tab, the recommended main jet, needle type and clip position, slow jet and air screw position are shown. These data are calculated depending on the weather conditions and the engine configuration introduced in the next tabs. In addition, this tab lets to make a fine tuning adjustment to adapt to a concrete engine.\n- Weather: you can set the values for current temperature, altitude, pressure and humidity.

Using all the data the application will give you some recommendations about how to adjust your chassis in order to resolve any set up problem that you're suffering. For each advice, you'll find an explanation about the adjustment. The explanation usually contains pictures to be more understandable.\n\nThe application is valid for sprint (road) karts and for all classes (adult or senior, cadet, junior). It's usefull for both experienced or novice drivers. For the former, it'll be a second opinion about what's wrong with the chassis setup, and for novices it will teach them the secrets of the chassis adjustments and chassis setup.\n\nThe application is made up of four tabs that are described next:\n\n- Driving: in this tab you'll have to inform about how the driver feels the behaviour of the kart in corners. In the first fields, \"Behaviour in corners\" you'll have to enter the information about what the driver is feeling and in which grade, that is, if it's very noticeable or not. These are the most important information used by the application to calculate the advices. You can enter, in this tab, if the track is clockwise or anti-clockwise, and the current temperature. Both elements are taking into consideration for calculations.\nBesides, you can indicate some information about the driver in order to adjust the calculations for his weight and chassis special features. \n\n- Pressure: in this tab you can inform about the hot and cold pressures of each tyre. \n\n- Temperature: you can set in this screen the information about hot tyre temperatures in the inside, middle and outside of the patch.\n\n- Results: this tab will show you some recommendations related on which adjustments you can do to solve any problem in the chassis setup that you can be suffering. A screen with detailed information about the adjustment will be shown. This explanation is very important in the \"Modify pressures\" advice, because it will show how much you should adjust your pressures.\n\nThe app let you use different measure units: ºC y ºF for temperatures, PSI and BAR for pressures, lb and kg for weights."

You can time relay teams with a single button, recording individual splits along with total individual and teams times.\n\nIt includes support for 3 type of courses: SCY (25y), SCM (25m) y LCM (50m). Also it has 26 predefined events (21 individual and 5 relays). \n\nThe application can be used to time one or multiple swimmers in the same race. Also it includes a module which allows you to time relay events. \n\nKeeps all your events history for later review and analysis. Each performance can be shared by email. \n\nIt allows you to Import/Export swimmers. This is useful when you have a big roaster and needs to be imported to the app. Also if you have the app installed in different devices (iPad and iPhone), it facilitates the process of keeping on sync the roaster. \n\nIt allows to predefine Teams of swimmers (before the meet). These teams, along with individual swimmers, are available to pick from when using the app during meets; these expedite you the process of timing events during the meet. \n\nSmart Stop feature: because this app has preloaded the events, it knows exactly when the final lap is, so it will stop the stopwatch at the end of the final lap, regardless of the button you use (lap or stop). \n\nLaps can be set at one length of the course or two lengths of the course based on your preferences.\n\nBecause StopWatch for Track and Field knows the event characteristics, you can record: \n\n-The distance for each lap \n-The swimmer estimated time during each lap\n-The estimated time of your relay team\n-The individual lap times and total time per leg in relay events \n\nIf you have questions, suggestions, issues, before writing it in a review, first don't hesitate to contact us to stopwatchsm@gmail.com"

      "label": "One of the basic principles of Clay Target shooting is the process of first visualising and then physically re-creating what you've seen in your mind's eye. In Olympic Trap we don't know the direction of the target but we know the scheme. Confidence can be enhanced by mentally walk through the scheme before you step on the shooting range using this App. \n\nThis App contains the nine ISSF Olympic Trap tables so that you can accustom to the angles and elevations that you'll experience on the shooting range.\n\nThe App can also be used as shooting game. The target can be shot by swing through with your finger through the flying target. For a more realistic experience, the App uses real life shooting range changing background.\n\nBenefits:-\n\n    1)Faster target acquisition.\n    2)Improve target recognition on dark green backgrounds.\n    3)If projected on a wall, it can be used for dry fire training.\n    4)Improve clay target mental imagery and visualisation.\n    5)Enhance confidence and preparation.\n    6)Enhance Eye-Hand coordination.\n\n\nFeatures:-\n\n    1)Contains the nine ISSF Schemes.\n    2)Target can be shot using a swing through with tip of finger.\n    3)You can have two shots at a clay with shotgun sound.\n    4)25 targets are thrown as per real life situation.\n    5)Target Speed can be adjusted from 0.6 sec to 10 sec.\n    6)Target to target delay can be adjusted from 0 to 15 sec. \n    7)Three real life shooting range backgrounds for a realistic experience.\n    8)Target breaks on hit.\n    9)Available for the iPhone and the iPad.\n    10) Chose between Competition mode ( our of 25), Show Scheme or 2017 ISSF Final format ( 50 targets).\n    11) Supports acoustic control  so you can call for the target using your voice.\n    12) Compete online on the Apple Game Center. You can tap into the leaderboards which will show your rank against your friends.\n13) Apple Watch App \n\n\"Great app for getting you ready for the round. Even small things can help you reach the top of the game. With this you can read the targets better and you will be ready for all schemas!\" - David Kostelecký, Beijing 2008 Olympic Gold Medalist."

It doesn’t require any connection to your car. Results are provided as detailed reports featuring interactive charts.\n\nHow does PerfExpert dyno works ? It's simple :\n1. Create your car profile => Describe your car to PerfExpert by providing information such as curb weight, tire sizes or engine displacement. If you don't know how to find your car's specifications, we help you to do so.\n2. Mount your phone in your car => No need to connect your phone to your car. With your phone firmly mounted inside your car, PerfExpert can rely on its internal sensors to measure the real acceleration of your car.\n3. Accelerate through the entire engine rev range => On a flat, straight and horizontal road, perform an acceleration from low rev to the maximum rev, keeping the same gear : that's it!\n\nIMPORTANT : dyno test is not compatible with automatic gearboxes that doesn't have a manual mode.\n\nWith such a tool, you can check the efficiency of your various tunings, ECU mapping, chiptuning, and even your chassis settings.\n\nUsing the specification of the tested car and your device’s accelerometer, the application runs our algorithms and dynamic power loss calculations to provide the performances of your car with high accuracy.\n\nSkeptical? Here is a selection of comparison tests between “PerfExpert - Car Onboard Dyno” and real chassis dynos, performed by some of our users : http://bit.ly/perfexpert_vs_chassis_dyno\n\nFor further information, you can find our FAQ at https://www.perfexpert-app.com/faq\n\nHere are sample dyno and timed run reports created using the application :\nhttps://network.perfexpert-app.com/results/featured\n\nJoin now the growing PerfExpert community:\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/PerfExpert\n- Support : https://www.facebook.com/groups/perfexpert/\n\nFeatures:\n- Dyno test : measure the power and torque of your engine with advanced loss calculation model. Detection of the engine rev limiter. Detailed reports featuring interactive charts of wheel and engine horsepower and torque / engine speed, just like a regular chassis dynamometer.\n\n- Compute corrected power and torque using the correction norm of your choice (atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature and air humidity are taken into account). Available standards: DIN (Europe), SAE (America), JIS (Japan), CEE (Europe) and ISO (International).\n\n- Timed Run test to measure your 0-60mph, 0-60ft, 0-1/8mi, 0-1/4mi, 0-100km/h, 0-20m, 0-200m, 0-400m,  and much more.\n\n- Use of your phone accelerometer at its maximum frequency and advanced signal processing for smoothed curves.\n\n- Custom choice of units from a large choice: Hp, Ch, Cv, Kw, Nm, Ft.Lb, mKg, Mph, Km/h, m, ft, G, m/s², psi, inHg, mBar, °C, °F\n\n- Export reports in Tab Separated Value format and PNG"

      "label": "Sailing on the go – Tactical Sailing Tips\nWhether a rookie or a professional sailor, everyone interested in the sport of sailing can find a selection of the most important tips needed to steer your boat the \"Right of Way\", to take the wind from the best side and to also make use of tactical maneuvers while racing against other opponents. \n\nThe main purpose of this app is to visualize the paths sailed in 16 tips overall as animated video clips for following advanced racing tactical situations: \n- speed of boats,\n- position of sails, as well as direction and strength of wind,\n- for tactical maneuvers against the wind,\n- basic Right of Way Rules (ISAF / World Sailing).\nAll animations are presented as video clips, comments can be printed out (pdf) as an extension to the tips and their simulated scenes, which you should watch on your iPhone or iPad. After downloading you can use the tips without internet access to take with you on your yacht. \n\nIn 2012 these tips were awarded winner of the \"European Award for Technology Supported Learning - Best Media Didactics!“ \niPhone and iPad: This App, however, is only the first step into the world of sailing. Designed for iPad, it will also display on iPhone, but of course in smaller sizes of videos. The first three tips are with sound, the others are without sound, it is  because of memory allocation restrictions (150 MB). Therefore the text is a useful extension for iPhone because of its small font size, print and read the comments in a .pdf file. The video clips are sized to be presented on Apple TV.\nThese tips - and further 40 tips - are part of a game: \"Tactical Sailing - A Game Against the Wind\" and “Boat Against Boat” and \"Coach´s Toolbox\".  If you want to have fun with a powerful Tactic and Strategy game,  see a demo for free and order it on our website: www.Tacticalsailing.com - runs on Mac and PC.  Keep in touch with other Tactical Sailors Lounge and coaches, see the race board, news and Info online. © Photo front page: Fried Elliott."

      "label": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal"

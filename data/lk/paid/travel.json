      "label": "eCurrency is far more than an easy to use currency converter and handy calculator. It supports over 200 popular currencies; works without active internet connection and even supports custom rates. eCurrency offers rich graphical charts for all exchange rates and supports calculations with historical exchange rates, making this the perfect tool for business, overseas travel and for anyone interested in currency trading.\n\neCurrency offers the following features:\n\n► Easy-to-use appealing interface\n► One screen for all major functionalities\n► Designated keypad for fast number entry; plus a handy built-in math’s calculator\n► Configures up to 8 converters; swipe through as on the iPhone‘s home screen\n► Supports over 200 currencies (for a full list see: http://bit.ly/knBkeS)\n► Detailed graphical charts for all exchange rates (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, and 5-years)\n► Automatic setting of home currency and number formatting \n► Reliable functionality: No active internet connection required\n► Exchange rates automatically updated on startup (Automatic update can be deactivated to avoid roaming costs)\n► Supports custom exchange rate entry\n► One touch reverse currency conversion\n► Special ‘shake to inverse calculation’ feature\n► Select and create a list of preferred currencies for fast access\n\n\n==Easy to use interface==\neCurrency interface is designed for ease of use. Just start the application and type in the amount you want to convert and eCurrency converts instantly. Tap on one of the flags to change the currency you want to convert to. A built-in calculator allows for math calculations. The current exchange rate and rate change compared to the previous day is conveniently displayed in the main interface.\n\n==Favorites Support==\neCurrency supports over 200 currencies. The “Favorites” functionality allows you to define the currency pairs you use as favorites. To create a new favorite go into the “Settings” and touch the “+” Button. You can swipe through all your favorites on the main calculation interface just as you swipe the pages on the iPhone’s home screen.\n\n== Charts and Historic Rates==\neCurrency provides detailed historical charts for all exchange rates. Just rotate the device to landscape, to view the chart for the active currency pair. You can switch the chart display between a 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year or 5-year period. Tap on the chart to display the exact exchange rate tor a particular day. Tap and hold to use a specific exchange rate for historic calculations.\n\n== Exchange Rate Updates ==\neCurrency updates exchange rates automatically on every start-up or on demand. You can turn off automatic updates to avoid roaming costs. The conversion and calculation functionally works completely offline using the latest downloaded exchange rates; the display of historical charts requires an active internet connection.\n\n==Rates Provider==\neCurrency is not dependant on any single data-source. The application obtains its exchange rates from our self-developed Currency-Provider-engine that aggregates rates data from multiple sources to secure the reliability of exchange rate updates.\n\n== Tutorial & Support==\nOn the first startup a short self-running demo is displayed to introduce you to the app. We appreciate any reviews or comments you may have on eCurrency in iTunes. If you have any questions please contact us directly, as we are unable to respond to your enquiries via iTunes."

In map view, you can tap any wifi icon where wireless information is available, and use the button to copy the password to the clipboard. The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use WiFox when you’re traveling.\n\n*Click Copy to easily paste passwords into wireless network settings.\n\n*Users can also add passwords they find from airports around the world. Those passwords are then sent to foXnoMad for verification and approval before they are added to the map.\n\n*In ‘List View’ you can update passwords for airports already added (when you’ve noticed some changes). As you travel you can also rate the wireless hotspot information to let us know if the details worked for you or not. Based on traveler feedback, the connection information is updated, verified, or removed.\n\n*WiFox icons indicate how fresh, reliable, and highly rated a given airport wireless network’s information is.\n\n*WiFox is updated continuously with information travelers, pilots, and other users send through the WiFox app, foXnoMad website, and foXnoMad Facebook and Twitter accounts. WiFox currently has wireless Internet information for over 700 airports around the world.\n\n*The map is updated automatically upon opening the app (when you have Internet access) or by clicking the ‘Update’ button on the map or refresh icon on the List View.\n\n*WiFox also protects users on free (open) wifi networks by telling you the proper network name, so you don't unintentionally connect to a rogue or malicious access point.\n\nWiFox Premium subscriptions unlock the following features:\n\n* Automatic notifications of the highest rated password, with network connection information, as soon as you land. WiFox Premium detects the airport you're at and displays the most relevant wifi network name and password so you can get online as soon as you step off the plane.\n\n* View password ratings to see which passwords work best throughout an airport so you can connect to the strongest and most reliable connection.\n\n* Be able to add your own password ratings within WiFox. Premium user priority ratings ensure the best wifi passwords are always displayed.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can cancel anytime with your iTunes account settings.

All the hidden details will be displayed in an easy-to-read format.  Boarding Pass Scanner interprets the data so you can quickly see what's there.  Other barcode scanning applications simply present the encoded text, requiring you to hunt through to find the information.\n\nFeatures:\n• Display the data from any standard airline boarding pass in an easy-to-read manner\n• Easily track your flight status with no typing required\n• Ensure your frequent-flier number is encoded so you get your miles\n• Quickly share your flight information with friends and family via email\n• Validate that your TSA Pre√ access is properly encoded in your boarding pass\n\nIf you are a frequent flier, you will find that this application comes in handy, especially during irregular operations, when your flight can change at a moment's notice.  Scan the boarding pass and email it to colleagues, family, or friends so they have your updated flight information.\n\nNote that although most airlines follow the barcoded boarding pass standard (we have successfully tested dozens of airlines, around the world), some airlines don't exactly follow the standard.  As we identify them them, we continue update the app to support them.  If you find a Boarding pass that doesn't properly decode, contact our support with a clear photo of your boarding pass, and we will add support for that airline.\n\n-- Please note that this app does not change a paper boarding pass to a mobile boarding pass.  Not all airlines support mobile boarding passes at all stations; please refer to your airline for more information on obtaining mobile boarding passes.  This application presents the information encoded in a barcoded boarding pass for your inspection. --"

All the data used in this app is built into the software, so you can follow the city walks or use the city map without internet access or cellular data plan. No need to pay the costly roaming charges when traveling to foreign cities. The app works with your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.\n\nThe powerful navigation assistance includes:\n\n* Walk routes clearly displayed on map.\n* Precise walking directions from one sight to the next.\n* `FindMe` displays your exact location and Auto Tracking displays your movement on the map (this feature is not supported by the iPod Touch and iPad wifi models).\n* Built-in compass to show you the direction.\n* Create your own walks to see the attractions you like.\n* A detailed city map which can be used independently for your other traveling needs.\n\nPlease visit our website at www.GPSmyCity.com to find city walks for over 470 cities worldwide.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. This app gives you the option to turn off the GPS tracking in the background to prolong the battery life."

The information is pulled from official sources and contacts so you know where you can fly, the rules to abide by, and the places where you should leave your drone at home. DroneMate can save you time, money, and hassle at customs as many countries (even major tourist destinations) won't let you bring a drone into the country. The map is available offline so you don’t need an Internet connection to use DroneMate when you’re traveling.\n\n*U.S. state laws are also included.\n\n*The information is pulled from official sources - there is a lot of misinformation about drone rules and laws floating online - DroneMate gives you a clear listing of the laws, rules, and places where they haven't been completely defined yet.\n\n*Shows information for specific cities, touristic sights, and other areas where drone use has special rules or restrictions.\n\n*DroneMate is updated regularly in real-time with information obtained from a number of official sources.\n\n*DroneMate has a user comment system where travelers can add their experiences droning, importing, and dealing with authorities in each specific country. The comments are useful in situations where the authorities themselves are confused or unaware of the laws, non-common situations, and other anecdotes that can help other travelers.\n\n*Users can also post questions in the comment section for other travelers or the administrator.\n\n*All comments are rated by other users, so the most useful, informative responses are highlighted on top of the others.\n\nAfter a 30-day free trial period a $24.99/year purchase will be applied to your iTunes account following confirmation of a Premium upgrade.

      "label": "Travel the world with confidence and enjoy local dishes without compromising your vegan beliefs! With your trusty Vegan Passport, you can be sure of finding vegan food in restaurants around the globe.\n\nThis multilingual vegan guide is a must-have for globetrotting vegans. It’s small enough to slip into your pocket, but big enough to include the languages of over 96% of the world’s population.\n\nThe fifth edition of this essential guide has been updated and expanded, and now boasts 78 languages including Hausa, Igbo, Xhosa and Zulu.\n\nIncluding fail-safe pictures, which can be used when words don’t work, the Vegan Passport has all situations covered. This will ensure that you have no problem explaining what you do and don’t eat, no matter where you are in the world.\n\nWhen visiting a restaurant, show your waiter the relevant entry from this app, and ask them to read it.  Do not attempt to pronounce the text yourself!  If you are invited to a private home for a meal, show your host the relevant entry well in advance.  \n\nIf booking a hotel by post or email, send a copy of the relevant page.  Please note that several languages may be used in the place you are visiting, so you may be able to offer the reader a choice of languages.  \n\nIf all else fails then you can show them the images depicting what a vegan eats and what a vegan does not eat.\n\nWhen booking flights then you can refer to the below airplane meal code to request a vegan meal when booking.\n\nThe Vegan Society is a registered charity and the oldest vegan society in the world, founded on 1 November 1944, in the UK by Donald Watson.\n\nWhat do we want? Simple: a world where humans do not exploit non-human animals. A world where animals are free to exist in their own right. We promote a lifestyle that excludes, as far as possible and practical, all forms of exploitation of - and cruelty to - animals for the purposes of food, clothing or anything else.\n\nWe also want a just world for humans. A world where resources are utilised in a sustainable way to ensure all current and future generations are provided for - a world where no one goes hungry. At the heart of the sustainability and food justice agenda is plant-based food production and consumption: veganism."

If you ever wonder where you are, your altitude, ground speed, direct distance to your destination in Miles, Nautical Miles and Kilometers, and how many hours you still have to get there, this app will help you!  \n\n Flight Nav uses GPS signals while in Airplane Mode to display your position, estimated distance, and time to your destination.\n\nYou can record your flight and later share it as a GPX file. This option will consume more battery as it will operate even while you are not using your device.\n\nOther features include a \"Don't sleep\" feature to keep the screen on.\n\n  GPS reception from within an aircraft can sometimes be poor. Best results are with window seats, or close to them, and you might have to wait longer to get results than you would while on the ground. What this means is that you might not get any signal at all, and the app might not work as expected every time, especially if you're sitting in the middle seats of a wide body airplane.\n\nMap detail will not be available at every zoom level - since you will be running offline - and you should use the app before flying, while still connected, in order to cache map information.\n\n  You should only use your device when allowed by the cabin crew - Please, pay attention to the specific instructions regarding mobile devices. If you have doubts about using your device, even with Airplane Mode enabled, please consult the cabin crew.  \n\nYou can add your own destinations by long pressing the map on the location you want.\n\nContinued use of GPS can dramatically decrease battery life."

Ideal for almost anything that requires measuring outdoor distance traveled such as walking, running, driving, boating, or hiking.  Note that GPS does not work well under a roof.  For best results, use outdoors.\n\nBenefits of the paid version:\n- Landscape and splitscreen support.\n- Ability to have multiple trips.  Each trip can be stopped and started independently.\n- Receive notifications while the application is closed at distance intervals of your choosing.\n- Custom units readout.  For example, you want to know how many calories you have burned.  You can customize this to include anything that has a linear relationship with distance traveled.  This can be different for each trip.\n- No advertisements.\n- Export trips via email and optionally restore later.\n\nDisplays:\n- Distance\n- Time elapsed\n- Speed (average or current)\n- Displacement (straight line distance from your starting point) This can be hidden.\n\nDistance units include:\n- Kilometers\n- Miles\n- Nautical miles\n- Meters\n- Feet\n\nSpeed units include:\n- Kilometers per hour\n- Miles per hour\n- Nautical miles per hour\n- Meters per second\n- Feet per second\n\nOther features:\n- Large font adjustable display.\n- Accurate to within 1 percent when compared to most car odometers under normal driving conditions.\n- Includes a lock to help prevent accidental reset of your trip. After unlocked, it locks back in a few seconds, or you can lock it yourself.\n- Approximates distance traveled in some GPS dead spots such as driving through a tunnel by adding the as-a-bird flies distance to your trip.\n\nPlease also note:\n- GPS Odometer does run in the background if you leave it running.  Be sure to pause the trip when you are finished or battery life will be negatively affected.  The timer stops when the trip is paused.\n- To change the display, tap the unlock button and notice the three green boxes that temporarily appear. Each button adjusts a different part of the display.\n- You can change the language to English in the application settings.\n\nPlease visit the web page for more details."

The odds presented are an estimate of historical risk and not a prediction of future performance. \n\nIf you have any questions please contact info@vanillapixel.com or follow @fearofflyingapp on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram."

      "label": "This App is based on content licensed from Mayo Clinic and helps travelers safeguard their health before, during and after travel. This App is developed by experienced travel medicine consultants from Mayo Clinic focusing on your health during travel and provides tips for preventing and handling illnesses while traveling. Providers refer their patients to this App so that travelers have the information when they need.\n\nThe App is easy to use:\n\n1. Find your destination by browsing or searching from the home screen.\n2. When you find your destination country, press “Add This to My Trips” \n3. Get a list of recommended vaccines by pressing “Health and Vaccinations”. (If you have not received the recommended vaccines for this trip, contact your healthcare provider). This section also tells you if you need to take medicine for malaria prevention (an infection transmitted by mosquitoes that attacks and breaks down red blood cells in your body).\n4. “Packing List” recommends things you should carry with you for that trip (touching the radial buttons marks those items complete). You can modify this list and add new items.\n5. “To Do” section reminds you of important travel and health related preparations you need to make before your trip. Add or delete items based on your needs.\n6. Save your travel documents and health related information in “My Stuff” section.\n\nDetails of App features:\n\nCustomized recommendations for travel health based on your travel itinerary.  Recommendations on safe travel for sick travelers.\n\nLicensed Mayo Clinic's content for \"Health\" section provides information on symptoms and prevention strategies for a broad range of travel related illnesses including Jet Lag and Sleep, Motion and Altitude Sickness, Travel Diarrhea, insect transmitted illnesses and many more. \n\nLatest safety alerts are a touch away. Navigate to Travel Alerts and Warnings issued by US Department of State (links provided in the app). While in this section, enroll in Smart Travel Enrollment Program (STEP), a free service to allow U.S. citizens/Nationals traveling abroad to enroll with the local U.S. Embassy.\n\nThe app provides simple exercises that can be performed with limited leg space on board aircraft. How? Well, we've got pictures to show you how. Stay fit while on board aircraft and prevent the dreaded blood clots in the legs.\n\nWhat if you lose your passport while traveling? We've got you covered. Store all your travel documents in \"My Stuff\" section. \n\nThe app lets you store Immunization records, your doctor’s contact information, list of allergies, medication information (pictures of pills, dosages, frequency) and your health insurance information.  This information can be life saving in case you lose your luggage and medications kept in it (Trust us, it happens more frequently than you think).\n\nStore unlimited customized items with pictures in the “My Stuff” Custom Item section of the App.  It is up to your imagination as you can use the packing list as your shopping list.  All information is stored on your device, making it available when needed and eliminating cloud-based document storage risk.\n\nUpon return, archive the trip and you can use your customized lists for your next destination (a great feature for frequent fliers).\n  \nFriendly reminder: Keep in mind that this app is not a replacement for consultation with a Travel Medicine Doctor or your primary healthcare provider. Your medical condition may warrant precautions that your Doctor may tell you.  So pay a visit before travel.\n\nThis is the only App that has information on Hajj and Umrah."

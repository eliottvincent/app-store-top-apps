From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Tūkstančiai vairuotojų jau sėkmingai išlaikė egzaminą, išlaikyk ir tu. \n\nKET bilietai ir testai yra panašūs į „Regitros“ egzamino klausimus bei yra lietuvių kalba.\n\nKategorijos: A (motorelis, motociklas), B (lengvasis autombilis), C (krovininis automobilis), D (autobusas).\n\nKETBILIETAI bilietų klausimus prižiūri ir atnaujina vairavimo mokyklų teorijos ekspertai iš 4 Lietuvos miestų.\n\nKodėl KETBILIETAI geriausia:\n\n- KETBILIETAI rekomenduoja vairavimo mokyklos: „mokiniai, kurie ruošėsi egzaminui spręsdami šiuos testus, egzaminą „Regitroje“ išlaikė iš pirmo karto.“\n\n- KET bilietai sukurti pagal naujausias KET ir VĮ „Regitra“ klausimus;\n\n- KET testų turinys nuolat prižiūrimas ir atnaujinamas;\n\n- Pasiruošite vairavimo teorijos egzaminui daug greičiau: sistema seka jūsų mokymosi procesą ir jei konkretų klausimą teisingai atsakėte bent du kartus iš eilės – jums šio „išmokto“ klausimo nebepateiks;\n\n\nMokydamiesi jūs galite pasirinkti testą tik iš „neišmoktų“ klausimų. Jums bus pateikti tik klaidingai atsakyti klausimai. Taip daug greičiau pasiruošite vairavimo teorijos egzaminui VĮ „Regitra“.\n\nKą sako programėlės naudotojai:\n\n\"Laikiau 3 kartus Regitroj, pirmus du nesprendziau bilietų KETBILIETAI, pasprendes čia 3 kartą išlaikiau Regitroje be nei vienos klaidos.\"\nRimvis\n\n\"PUIKIAI TINKA PRADEDANTIESIEMS!!!!!!! Perskaiciau knygute ir nusipirkau app narystę, per 6 dienas viską išmokau, o 7 viska pakartojau. Išlaikiau iš pirmo karto 31/35. DEKUI!!!\"\nJokūbas\n\nDaugiau atsiliepimų skaitykite: http://www.ketbilietai.lt/atsiliepimai/\n\nTurite pastabų? Parašykite info@ketbilietai.lt\nwww.ketbilietai.lt\n\nMokymo turinys atitinka vairavimo teorijos egzamino reikalavimams VĮ \"Regitra\".\nKlausimai atnaujinti pagal naujas kelių eismo taisykles."

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain.

To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy.

There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States.

Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

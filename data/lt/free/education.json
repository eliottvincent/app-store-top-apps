Tūkstančiai vairuotojų jau sėkmingai išlaikė egzaminą, išlaikyk ir tu. \n\nKET bilietai ir testai yra panašūs į „Regitros“ egzamino klausimus bei yra lietuvių kalba.\n\nKategorijos: A (motorelis, motociklas), B (lengvasis autombilis), C (krovininis automobilis), D (autobusas).\n\nKETBILIETAI bilietų klausimus prižiūri ir atnaujina vairavimo mokyklų teorijos ekspertai iš 4 Lietuvos miestų.\n\nKodėl KETBILIETAI geriausia:\n\n- KETBILIETAI rekomenduoja vairavimo mokyklos: „mokiniai, kurie ruošėsi egzaminui spręsdami šiuos testus, egzaminą „Regitroje“ išlaikė iš pirmo karto.“\n\n- KET bilietai sukurti pagal naujausias KET ir VĮ „Regitra“ klausimus;\n\n- KET testų turinys nuolat prižiūrimas ir atnaujinamas;\n\n- Pasiruošite vairavimo teorijos egzaminui daug greičiau: sistema seka jūsų mokymosi procesą ir jei konkretų klausimą teisingai atsakėte bent du kartus iš eilės – jums šio „išmokto“ klausimo nebepateiks;\n\n\nMokydamiesi jūs galite pasirinkti testą tik iš „neišmoktų“ klausimų. Jums bus pateikti tik klaidingai atsakyti klausimai. Taip daug greičiau pasiruošite vairavimo teorijos egzaminui VĮ „Regitra“.\n\nKą sako programėlės naudotojai:\n\n\"Laikiau 3 kartus Regitroj, pirmus du nesprendziau bilietų KETBILIETAI, pasprendes čia 3 kartą išlaikiau Regitroje be nei vienos klaidos.\"\nRimvis\n\n\"PUIKIAI TINKA PRADEDANTIESIEMS!!!!!!!

Parašykite info@ketbilietai.lt\nwww.ketbilietai.lt\n\nMokymo turinys atitinka vairavimo teorijos egzamino reikalavimams VĮ \"Regitra\".\nKlausimai atnaujinti pagal naujas kelių eismo taisykles."

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture. In contrast to a geo-cache or a scavenger hunt Actionbound requires the players to create their own content."

      "label": "Learning a language can be an experience that transforms your life. Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n• 2019 PCMag Editors’ Choice\n• 2019 Tabby Awards Winner\n• 2019 Best Mobile App Awards: Best Designed App and Best Overall App\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next.

Flip between languages as often as you’d like and enjoy the freedom to get seriously curious. To access, simply select Unlimited Languages when you subscribe. \n\n\nChoose from 24 languages: \nArabic, Chinese (Mandarin), Dutch, English (American or British), Filipino (Tagalog), French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin American or Spain), Swedish, Turkish, or Vietnamese. \n\n\n\nSelect a subscription: \nWe offer 3 and 12-month subscriptions—as well as a Lifetime option. \n\n\n\nSubscription Details:\n• Get full access to all lessons, stories, and audio companion when you subscribe to Rosetta Stone. \n• Payment will be charged to your Apple ID. \n• Your account will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• Manage or cancel your subscription from your App Store User Settings at any time after purchasing.

      "label": "iNaturalist is a social network for sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. The primary goal is to connect people to nature, and the secondary goal is to generate scientifically valuable biodiversity data from these personal encounters. \n\niNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals with visually similar suggestions and verification by dedicated contributors. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you'll create research-quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n• Identification suggestions: Take or import a photo and view the top 10 most visually similar species matches and tap through to get more information. You can view these suggestions even before creating an account.\n• Feedback from our community: Create an account to share your observations and start a conversation about what you saw. Can’t identify the organism? Start with a broad identification like “plants” or “fungi” so others with more expertise can find it and refine the identification. \n• Keep a record of all living things: Build your life list by posting to iNaturalist. Where, when, and what you saw is the basis of each observation you create.\n• Grounded in science: Every identification is connected to the tree of life, which means you can search for broad classifications like “Ferns” or “Fungi” as well as species-level identifications like “Humpback Whale” (and everything in between). \n• Advancing science & conservation: Millions of observations created and identified by the iNaturalist community are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility where they are used to advance scientific understanding of biodiversity through open data and open science. \n• Enabling citizen science and community science: Join any of the tens of thousands of projects around the world on iNaturalist to draw attention to and collect data about particular species or places.\n• Not-for-profit: iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, both 501(c)3 nonprofits in the United States. iNaturalist is free for anyone to use thanks to the generous support of many organizations and individuals. Thank you!\n• No hidden charges: This app is truly free because we believe nature is for everyone.\n• Best for wild plants and animals: The iNaturalist community is better at identifying wild plants and animals than those in gardens or horticulture. Get outside and find what’s wild!\n• Control how your location is shared: Set the privacy to obscured (only general location is shared) or private (no location is shared at all, but much harder for others to help identify). The locations of species at risk from disturbance are automatically obscured.\n• More than a mobile app: iNaturalist has even more extensive features and tools for learning and exploration. Get the full experience at inaturalist.org!\n• 35+ languages: iNaturalist has been translated into dozens of languages thanks to multilingual enthusiasts who want to see the community grow.\n• A global network: iNaturalist is used in every country on earth! In many countries, we have formal agreements with local organizations to promote iNaturalist. Use this app for contributing to all iNaturalist Network sites, including Naturalista (Mexico and Colombia), iNaturalist.NZ (New Zealand), iNaturalist.ca (Canada), Biodiversity4All (Portugal), iNaturalistAU (Australia), iNaturalistPa (Panama), iNaturalistEc (Ecuador), ArgentiNat (Argentina), iNaturalistil (Israel), and iNaturalistFi (Suomi/Finland)."

There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go.

Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

We do this by building interactive experiences using videos of native speakers.\n\nWe‘ve built this app in a partnership with the Easy German Youtube channel and have a strong focus on teaching German with real people and authentic language.\n\nWhy Seedlang?\n\nSimply put, we combine real humor and fun with a deep understanding of the German language. We craft experiences that are unlike others you have experienced before. \n\n=== Interactive stories\nWe use video to tell stories that are fun, surprising, and memorable. This will help to give context to what you are learning and make building new memories feel effortless.\n\n=== A new type of flashcards\nYou've never seen flashcards like these before. They combine video, speaking practice, and embedded grammar to create a fun and effective learning experience.\n\n=== Active learning through speaking\nRecording audio of your speech and comparing it with that of native speakers allows you to improve your pronunciation. As you practice these improvements, your muscle memory for the language strengthens and speaking becomes effortless.\n\n=== Grammar at your fingertips\nWe are most receptive to learning grammar after we've made a mistake. So, if you make a mistake with a word, simply click it to display detailed grammar information. It's like having a grammar book always ready to tell you what you need to know, when you need to know it.\n\n=== Customize your learning\nUse our vocab trainer to build flashcard decks tailored to specific vocabulary that you want to learn. Each card is pulled from one of our stories and has all of the fun context that will make this vocabulary easy to remember.\n\n=== Trivia game\nTest your German comprehension by competing against other German students in an interactive trivia game."

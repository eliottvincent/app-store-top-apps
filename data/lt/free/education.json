Tūkstančiai vairuotojų jau sėkmingai išlaikė egzaminą, išlaikyk ir tu. \n\nKET bilietai ir testai yra panašūs į „Regitros“ egzamino klausimus bei yra lietuvių kalba.\n\nKategorijos: A (motorelis, motociklas), B (lengvasis autombilis), C (krovininis automobilis), D (autobusas).\n\nKETBILIETAI bilietų klausimus prižiūri ir atnaujina vairavimo mokyklų teorijos ekspertai iš 4 Lietuvos miestų.\n\nKodėl KETBILIETAI geriausia:\n\n- KETBILIETAI rekomenduoja vairavimo mokyklos: „mokiniai, kurie ruošėsi egzaminui spręsdami šiuos testus, egzaminą „Regitroje“ išlaikė iš pirmo karto.“\n\n- KET bilietai sukurti pagal naujausias KET ir VĮ „Regitra“ klausimus;\n\n- KET testų turinys nuolat prižiūrimas ir atnaujinamas;\n\n- Pasiruošite vairavimo teorijos egzaminui daug greičiau: sistema seka jūsų mokymosi procesą ir jei konkretų klausimą teisingai atsakėte bent du kartus iš eilės – jums šio „išmokto“ klausimo nebepateiks;\n\n\nMokydamiesi jūs galite pasirinkti testą tik iš „neišmoktų“ klausimų. Jums bus pateikti tik klaidingai atsakyti klausimai. Taip daug greičiau pasiruošite vairavimo teorijos egzaminui VĮ „Regitra“.\n\nKą sako programėlės naudotojai:\n\n\"Laikiau 3 kartus Regitroj, pirmus du nesprendziau bilietų KETBILIETAI, pasprendes čia 3 kartą išlaikiau Regitroje be nei vienos klaidos.\"\nRimvis\n\n\"PUIKIAI TINKA PRADEDANTIESIEMS!!!!!!! Perskaiciau knygute ir nusipirkau app narystę, per 6 dienas viską išmokau, o 7 viska pakartojau. Išlaikiau iš pirmo karto 31/35. DEKUI!!!\"\nJokūbas\n\nDaugiau atsiliepimų skaitykite: http://www.ketbilietai.lt/atsiliepimai/\n\nTurite pastabų? Parašykite info@ketbilietai.lt\nwww.ketbilietai.lt\n\nMokymo turinys atitinka vairavimo teorijos egzamino reikalavimams VĮ \"Regitra\".\nKlausimai atnaujinti pagal naujas kelių eismo taisykles."

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

      "label": "Представляем Вам уникальный обучающий продукт \"LEXI24 Репетитор\" для заучивания более 250 самых важных слов и выражений на 34 иностранных языках. Модель обучения программы \"Репетитор\" основана на интуитивном, визуальном и слуховом восприятии иностранного языка, что позволяет в самый короткий срок освоить самые важные иностранные слова и выражения.\n\nНепосредственно из приложения доступны платные версии языковых модулей с более чем 2200 слов и выражений. Покупка пакета из всех 34 языков выгодна уже в том случае, если Вам необходим более чем один иностранный язык.\n\nМодель обучения программы \"Репетитор\" была разработана на кафедре теоретической лингвистики Университета Гёттингена. Эта уникальная модель основана на интуитивном, визуальном и слуховом восприятии иностранного языка.\n\nПо проведённым тестам в Университете Гёттингена (тестировался немецкий вариант программы) через три месяца обучения студенты, которые в дополнении к основному курсу использовали программу \"Репетитор\", наиболее точно могли переводить иностранную речь, иностранный текст, вести разговор на иностранном языке с большим словарным запасом и с меньшим количеством ошибок. Средняя оценка за базовые иностранные тесты у этой группы студентов была выше студентов, не входящих в эту группу.\n\nПрограмма не заменяет собой основной курс изучения иностранного языка. Она дополняет его. Пользоваться программой можно уже в самом начале базового обучения.\n\nУникальные особенности программы \"Репетитор\":\n• Интерфейс выполнен полностью на русском языке\n• 34 языков для обучения: английский (США), английский (Великобритания), арабский, болгарский, венгерский, вьетнамский, греческий, датский, иврит, испанский (Испания), испанский (Латинская Америка), итальянский, китайский (мандаринский), корейский, немецкий, нидерландский, норвежский, польский, португальский (Бразилия), португальский (Португалия), румынский, словацкий, тайский, турецкий, фарси, финский, французский, хинди, чешский, шведский, японский, украинский, хорватский и каталанский.\n• Все языки загружаемые. Вы загружаете только те языки, которые Вам нужны, экономя место. Далее подключение к сети Интернет не требуется.\n• Более 250 фраз для каждого языка совершенно бесплатно. Более 2200 слов и выражений для каждого языка в платном пакете.\n• Все слова и выражения озвученны носителями языков.\n• Аудиовизуальный тренинг - упражнение для аудиовизуального запоминания слов и фраз: одновременно со слуховым и визуальным восприятием, Вы видите написание на родном и иностранном языках.\n• 9 упражнения на проверку и закрепление знаний: \"Перевод с иностранного языка\", \"Усложнённый перевод с иностранного языка\", \"Перевод на иностранный язык\", \"Визуально-интуитивная тренировка\", \"Усложнённая визуально-интуитивная тренировка\", \"Диктант\", \"Угадайте слово\", \"Интуитивная тренировка\", \"Произношение\"\n• Уникальная возможность тренировки произношения с оценкой (верно или неверно).\n\n-----------------------\n***ВАЖНАЯ ИНФОРМАЦИЯ***\nВ App Store нет возможности давать ответы на вопросы в комментариях.

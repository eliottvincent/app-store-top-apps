From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go.

And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

Score 100% in the games and you can unlock an extra topic for free.\n\n\nWHY UTALK WORKS:\n\n1. LEARN FROM THE LOCALS: We record native speakers so you hear every word pronounced clearly. Mimic their pronunciation and compare your intonation with theirs. Practise until you get it right – you can even slow the audio down if it’s too fast.\n\n2. USEFUL EVERYDAY WORDS AND PHRASES. Topics take around two to three hours to complete. But you can dip in for just five minutes at a time or longer. With 60+ topics, that’s a total of 180 hours of learning.\n\n3. KEEPS YOU MOTIVATED: Check your scores on progress bars as you move through five progressively difficult games.

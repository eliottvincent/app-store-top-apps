Jums bus pateikti tik klaidingai atsakyti klausimai. Taip daug greičiau pasiruošite vairavimo teorijos egzaminui VĮ „Regitra“.\n\nKą sako programėlės naudotojai:\n\n\"Laikiau 3 kartus Regitroj, pirmus du nesprendziau bilietų KETBILIETAI, pasprendes čia 3 kartą išlaikiau Regitroje be nei vienos klaidos.\"\nRimvis\n\n\"PUIKIAI TINKA PRADEDANTIESIEMS!!!!!!!

Parašykite info@ketbilietai.lt\nwww.ketbilietai.lt\n\nMokymo turinys atitinka vairavimo teorijos egzamino reikalavimams VĮ \"Regitra\".\nKlausimai atnaujinti pagal naujas kelių eismo taisykles."

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Tiek miestuose, tiek regionuose skirtingai suvokiamos LGBT+ teisės, menki siekiai jas ginti: dėl pasyvios adaptacijos miestuose, dėl baimės veikti, ryšių su palaikančiais asmenimis neturėjimo, dėl stipriai išreikštos internalizuotos homofobijos, bifobijos ir transfobijos. Lietuvoje trūko įtraukių, prieinamų ir saugią veiklą užtikrinančių priemonių, kurios skatintų asmenis domėtis ir veikti individualiai ar grupėse per susivienijimus.\n\nVienas iš mūsų tikslų, kuriam, viliamės, pritarsite ir Jūs, yra informuotumo apie LGBT+ žmonių teises didinimas, įgalinant LGBT+ jaunimą bei kitas visuomenės grupes aktyviai domėtis žmogaus teisių problematika ir įsitraukti į visuomeninę veiklą ne tik miestuose, bet ir regionuose.\n\nŠi programėlė yra skirta švietimui žmogaus teisių tema ir aktyvizmo skatinimui. Tai - interaktyvus produktas, kuriame savanoriai (o galbūt, esant norui, net ir Jūs), ne tik kuria įvairias idėjas kaip galima būtų prisidėti gerinant žmogaus teisių situaciją Lietuvoje, bet ir solidariai kartu įgyvendina įvairias veiklas, kurioms randa laiko, galimybių ir noro.\n\nUž gerus pasiūlymus ir/ar atliktas užduotis kiekvienas dalyvis turės galimybę rinkti taškus, kitaip vaivorykštes, kurias Tolerantiško Jaunimo Asociacija stengsis jums iškeisti į nors ir nedidelius, tačiau malonius apdovanojimus.\n\n„Rainbow Challenge“ tai programėlė ir mokykloms\n\nMokyklose gali steigtis “Rainbow Challenge” klubai aktyviems ir pilietiškiems moksleiviams, norintiems prisidėti prie Lietuvos mokyklų tapsmo tolerantiškesnėmis ir saugesnėmis vietomis moksleiviams. Į „Rainbow Challenge” klubą prisijungę moksleiviai, kartu su mokytoju-kuratoriumi, organizuoja aktyvizmo, švietimo ir paramos veiklas visai mokyklos bendruomenei ir taip kovoja su mokykloje pasireiškiančiais homofobijos, transfobijos, seksizmo, rasizmo paplitimu bei neapykanta neįgaliesiems bei kitoms socialiai pažeidžiamoms grupėms.\n \n„Rainbow Challenge” pavadinimas simbolizuoja moksleivių vienybę ir savo įkvėpimo semiasi iš vaivorykštės, kaip gamtos reiškinio. Joje kiekviena spalva yra unikali bei vienodai svarbi. To mokykloje siekiama ir šia iniciatyva, kad moksleiviai, turintys skirtingas socialines tapatybes, turėtų jausti bendrystę ir būti integruoti, nė viena grupė neturi jaustis žemesne, ar kitaip nuskriausta.\n \nRainbow Challenge klubai veikia moksleivių lyderystės principu, klubui priklausantys moksleiviai vadovauja patys sau, tik jie sprendžia, kokius klubo tikslus išsikelti, kokias veiklas vykdyti ir į ką orientuotis. Klubai gali būti skirti išskirtinai aktyvizmui, išskirtinai švietimui ar tarpusavio pagalbai, be to gali derinti dvi ar visas tris iš šių funkcijų.\n\nMes šioje programėlėje, dėl jos lankstumo ir pritaikomumo, suteikiame erdvę mokiniams semtis įdėjų ką nuveikti mokykloje ir įgyvendinti veiklas tarpusavyje, bendradarbiaujant ne tik „Rainbow Challenge“ klube, bet ir savarankiškai, jei toks klubas dar neveikia.\n\nUž galimybę įgyvendinti šią iniciatyvą Tolerantiško Jaunimo Asociacija ir Labdaros paramos fondas FRIDA dėkoja savo partneriams ir rėmėjams: projektui „Rainbow Challenge” už LGBT+ teises ir galimybes”, kuris yra Aktyvių piliečių fondo, finansuojamo EEE finansinio mechanizmo lėšomis, dalis.

We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy.

Here is much to do!\n\nPEPI BATH is a role-play game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way.\n\nThe app has 4 parts as different situations in which this cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl to choose – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath.\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, where the player is free to choose what they do.\n\nIn PEPI BATH cleaning is fun. Besides washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth kid can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, funny duck or many other.  The game is full of similar mini tasks and small surprises. \n\nPEPI characters respond interactively and express their emotions. Even objects in PEPI BATH are like little characters. \n\nImportant: there is no advertising or in-app purchase in PEPI BATH.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n- NO ADVERTISING \n- NO IN-APP PURCHASE\n\nRecommended ages: 2-6"

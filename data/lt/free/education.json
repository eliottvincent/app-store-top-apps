      "label": "The Arduino Science Journal (formerly Science Journal, an initiative by Google) is free and allows you to gather data about the world around you by harnessing the sensors in your smartphone as well as sensors connected to Arduino. The Science Journal transforms smartphones and tablets into science notebooks that encourage students to explore their world.\n\nThe Arduino Science Journal app is recommended for students from 10 to 18 years of age.\n\nAbout Arduino Science Journal\nWith the Arduino Science Journal, you can learn interactively, conduct experiments and iterate on findings.\n\n•  Enhance your existing lesson plans: use the Science Journal with activities and assignments you have already prepared\n•  Classroom & home-school friendly: you don’t have to be in a classroom setting to start exploring. The Arduino Science Journal can be used to run experiments straight away, as long as you have your smartphone or tablet with you! \n•  Move learning outside: the use of mobile devices along with the types of experiments we offer encourage students to get out of their seats and open their eyes to the world around them through the power of science\n•  Science and data have no secrets: you can easily record your observations, store your data sensors in real-time and analyse them, just as a proper scientist! \n•  Connect the digital and the physical world from your pocket: go through a series of simple tutorials and start having fun with science\n\nWith built-in device sensors as well as external hardware, you can measure light, sound, movement, and much more.  You can also compare results, and even set triggers. \n\nTogether with the external hardware, (not included with the app), students are enabled to conduct more complex experiments, and advance in their scientific studies. As long as the external sensors are compatible with a Bluetooth-connecting device such as a microcontroller, there is no end to what experiments the students can make. Some popular sensors that the app can work with are: light, conductivity, temperature, force, gas, heart rate, respiration, radiation, pressure, magnetism, and many more.\n\nThe app is classroom-friendly, since students can sign in on any device and access their experiments to continue exploring the world, wherever they are!\n\nIf you’re an educator with a Google Classroom account, you can also subscribe to the Teacher Plan, which allows you to integrate the app with Google Classroom and share this integration with your students. You can then create assignments, templates, and experiments in the app and import existing classes from Google Classroom.\n\nPermissions notice:\n\n• Bluetooth: needed to scan for Bluetooth sensor devices.\n• Camera: needed to take pictures to document experiments and for the brightness sensor.\n• Photo Library: needed to store pictures taken to document experiments and for adding existing photos from your library to experiments.\n• Microphone: needed for sound intensity sensor.\n• Push notifications: needed to inform you of recording status when backgrounding the app.\n\nBenefits of using the Arduino Science Journal\n• It’s free and simple to use\n• Easy setup: download the app and start exploring with your phone’s built-in sensors\n• Cross-platform support\n• Portable: enhance your home learning or bring your device outside to study the world around you\n• Safe for children to use: COPPA Compliance underway \n• Fully compatible with Arduino hardware: keep experimenting with the Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab, as well as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board\n• Google Drive integration, as well as local download\n\n---\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.arduino.cc/en/sj-terms-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy\nChildren's Privacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/children-privacy-policy"

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

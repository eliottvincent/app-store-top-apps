Jums bus pateikti tik klaidingai atsakyti klausimai. Taip daug greičiau pasiruošite vairavimo teorijos egzaminui VĮ „Regitra“.\n\nKą sako programėlės naudotojai:\n\n\"Laikiau 3 kartus Regitroj, pirmus du nesprendziau bilietų KETBILIETAI, pasprendes čia 3 kartą išlaikiau Regitroje be nei vienos klaidos.\"\nRimvis\n\n\"PUIKIAI TINKA PRADEDANTIESIEMS!!!!!!!

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

You’ll be speaking English in no time without having to memorize lists of words and out-of-context grammar rules. \n\n\n\nIMMERSE IN REAL ENGLISH\n\nYou’ll make your way through an interactive and engaging story that takes place in New York. Lively, colorful, and sometimes surprising characters: an eccentric old lady will help you find a place to live, and a greedy hot-dog vendor who will try to short-change… They (and many more) speak different accents and will help you master street talk. There’s a new surprise around every corner, but Let Me Speak will help you talk your way out of any situation.\n\nEverything is in modern, everyday English with a full audio voiceover by native speakers from the United States. So you’ll learn real-world English and practice American pronunciation from the get-go. Each conversation takes no more than 3 minutes and will fit into even the busiest of schedules.\n\n\n\n\nIMPROVE YOUR VOCABULARY\n\nYou’ll learn 6,000 of the most common words everyone needs to travel, work, and communicate in a foreign language. Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations. Built-in games will challenge your skill and speed – you can even compete with other users around the world in real-time!"

Чтобы выучить английский язык и свободно общаться, не нужно тратить много денег на репетитора и заучивать тысячи слов. Достаточно выучить 300 самых употребляемых английских слов с помощью нашего приложения! Не удивляйтесь, по статистике в ежедневном общении человек использует лишь 300-350 слов, и это позволяет ему свободно изъясняться. Именно из такого количества слов состоит 90% повседневной речи. Поэтому для свободного общения на английском языке вам необходимо выучить лишь 300 наиболее употребимых слов. Специально для вас мы подобрали и поместили в удобное мобильное приложение только самые нужные для ежедневного общения слова. Просто скачайте наше приложение. Теперь выучить английский язык стало еще проще!\n\nХарактеристики приложения:\n- приложение не использует интернет, не подгружает изображения во время работы,\n- приложение не влияет на расход батареи,\n- озвучка слова, вы можете слышать как это слово правильно произносится.\n\n\nПринцип работы приложения: \nПрограмма вразброс показывает английские слова (под словом размещена транскрипция, которая поможет правильно произнести слово, также слово по умолчанию произносится программой, чтобы отключить произношение, нажмите на иконку динамика в верхнем) и предлагает варианты перевода на русский язык. Каждое английское слово программа выдает до тех пор, пока вы не выучите его. Приложение считает слово усвоенным, если вы правильно перевели его 5 раз подряд. Затем программа изымает из показов выученное слово.\n\nВ меню приложения находится статистика, в которой отражено, сколько всего слов выучено, сколько слов необходимо выучить, сколько ошибок допущено при изучении английского языка. В любой момент вы сможете сбросить данные статистики, а также изменить ваш родной язык или вернуться к изучению английского языка. Также в меню вы сможете отключить показ рекламы.\n\nЕсли вам понравилось приложение, оставьте свой отзыв.

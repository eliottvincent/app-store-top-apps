In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "Miego, ramybės ir dėmesingumo praktikos „mybe“ skirtos vaikams susikaupti ryte, nusiraminti dieną ir užmigti vakare. \n\nĮsigyjantieji programėlę „mybe“ suteikia nemokamą jos prieigą ir labiausiai nerimaujantiems vaikams. Programėlės lietuviškos versijos gali nemokamai klausytis Lietuvos ligoninėse sveikstantys vaikai, ukrainietiškosios – visi ukrainiečiai. \n\nPROBLEMA\n•\tVaikai kasdien patiria skirtingų įtampų ir emocijų, su kuriomis ne visada moka susidoroti patys. \n•\tJie jaučia nerimą, vis mažiau sugeba susikaupti, valdyti emocijas, prasčiau sugeba suprasti kito ar išreikšti savo jausmus, turi miego sutrikimų.\n•\tĮtampos kyla dėl santykių su tėvais, tėvų tarpusavio santykių, skyrybų ar jų sveikatos. \n•\tVaikams atsiranda daug emocijų dėl įgūdžių stokos bendraujant su bendraamžiais. \n•\tPastaruoju metu, vis daugiau vaikų jaudinasi dėl globalių problemų, tokių kaip COVID ar karo grėsmė. \n\nSPRENDIMAS\nPraktikų klausymasis vos po kelias minutes per dieną:\n•\tMažina stresą ir nerimą,\n•\tPagerina dėmesingumą, dėmesio sutelkimą,\n•\tLeidžia ramiau reaguoti į dirgiklius, \n•\tIšmoko labiau džiaugtis gerais, būti stipresniais liūdnais gyvenimo momentais,\n•\tPagerina miego režimą ir kokybę,\n•\tLavina emocinį intelektą ir vaizduotę.\n•\tGerina atmintį, \n•\tSustiprina imunitetą, \n•\tMoko būti gerais ir pozityviais žmonėmis.\n\nTURINYS\nProgramėlėje “Mybe” rasite praktikas skirtas rytui, miegui ar tiesiog ramybei. Kurdamos telkemės į pagalbą ekspertus vaikų psichologijos ir pedagogikos, meditacijos, muzikos ir muzikos terapijos srityse ir, aišku, vaikus. Mes pačios daug mokėmės sąmoningumo, daug meditavome ir supratome, kaip svarbu atrasti sau tinkamą raminantį ir vedantį praktikų balsą. Dėl to šias praktikas profesionaliai įgarsinome skirtingais vyrų, moterų ir vaiko balsais, jas papildėme gamtos ir muzikos garsais. Jei labiau patinka susitelkti į muziką ar gamtą, programėlėje rasite ir nusiraminti padedančių įrašų be balso. \n\nDažnai mažiesiems yra sunkiau nulaikyti dėmesį. Taigi skirtingai nuo praktikų saugusiems, vaikiškosiose mes nupasakojame daugiau vaizdinių. Dėmesingumo praktikose tai padeda vaikams susitelkti į turinį. Miegui skirtose meditacijose pasakojimas padeda mintims nuklysti, vaikams įsisvajoti ir užmigti.\n\nAteityje toliau pildysime praktikų sąrašą, atsižvelgiant į tai, kokių meditacijų klauso ir su kokiomis problemomis susiduria klausytojai.\n\nPRENUMERATOS SĄLYGOS \nDalis aplikacijos turinio yra nemokama (žymima be spynelės ikonėlės), kita dalis yra mokama (žymima su spynelės ikonėle).\n1 mėn — 4,99 EUR\n3 mėn — 4 EUR/mėn.\n6 mėn — 3 EUR/mėn.\n\nVaikai, gulintys ligoninėse Lietuvoje, gauna nemokamą prieigą savaitei. Kodo ieškokite pakabinto ligoninės koridoriuose arba r@mybe.lt atsiųskite įrodymą, kad vaikas yra šiuo metu gydomas ligoninėje.\n\nPlačiau apie mus www.mybe.lt \nNaudojimo politika: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivatumo politika: https://www.mybe.lt/privatumo-politika"

Programėlė apima daug aktualių klausimų, kurie svarbūs savo psichine ir fizine sveikata besirūpinantiems žmonėms:\r\n\r\n— kaip valdyti mintis ir emocijas;\r\n— kaip mažinti patiriamą stresą ir nerimą;\r\n— kaip lavinti psichologinį atsaprumą ir lankstumą;\r\n— kaip nusiraminti ir atstatyti vidinį balansą.\r\n\r\nVisi šie ir kiti aktualūs atsakymai integruoti į daugiau nei 18 valandų įrašų turinį. Nuosekliai ir reguliariai jų klausant, tai padeda ne tik gauti žinių ar momentiškai nusiraminti, bet kur kas daugiau - tai leidžia lavinti savistabos, emocijų ir dėmesio valdymo įgūdžius.\r\n\r\nPAUZĖ - tai ne tik programėlė. Tai labiau nuolat plečiama iniciatyva. Ji prasidėjo nuo jos kūrėjų vidinio jausmo, kad sąmoningumas yra visa ko atskaitos taškas. Mylėti. Dirbti. Gyventi. Daugiau apie tai - www.pauze.lt"

Tell us your diet goals, the foods you like, your budget, and what your schedule looks like, and we'll automatically generate a complete meal plan to meet your targets. It's like having a personal diet assistant.\n\nWe offer both free accounts and premium accounts. As a free user, you can create a day's meal plan and completely customize it however you want. Each meal can have different preferences, and your nutrition targets can be whatever you like.\n\nAs a premium user, we'll automatically generate a week of meal plans and send them to you with a grocery list via email. As you follow the plans, you can track what you did or didn't eat, and if you deviate from the plans, we make it easy to readjust your targets for the next week to stay on track. Try out the free account to see if our meal plans appeal to you, and upgrade when you're ready.\n\n- Follow any eating style or create your own (works for keto, paleo, vegetarian, vegan, and more)\n- Hit your macros and calorie targets every day\n- Empower yourself with automatic control over your diet\n- Take the anxiety out of picking what to eat\n- Personalize any of our recipes and they'll replace the original\n- Reduce food waste\n- Don't like our suggestions? Easily swap them out or configure the generator to only use foods you like\n- Manage your virtual pantry (with a premium account)\n\nNormal calorie trackers force you to add foods into your diary one by one. And by the end of the day, there's no guarantee that you'll be anywhere near the nutrition targets you're trying to reach. With our automatic planner, there's nothing to track because everything is already entered for you, and all you have to do is follow the plan.\n\n\nSubscription options:\n- You can download the app for free and create/customize as many unique meal plans as you want, and save one to your account.\n- To unlock the features of Eat This Much Premium, you can subscribe for either the monthly or yearly description.\n\nAuto-renew details:\n- The price to subscribe in your currency will be shown in the app before confirming the subscription.\n- After the free trial has ended, payment will be charged to your iTunes Account.\n- Your subscription will auto-renew unless cancelled 24 hours before the end of the current period (the auto-renew will continue with the same frequency that you select, either the monthly price for the  monthly subscription or yearly price for the yearly subscription).\n- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at the same price you initially paid.\n- Auto-renew can be turned off at any time from your iTunes Account Settings.\n- If you cancel your subscription or turn off auto renew in the middle of a billing cycle your account will remain premium until the end of that cycle.\n\nApple health integration:\nApple health syncing can be enabled in Settings -> Apple Health -> Enable Apple Health syncing for Premium users.\n\nWhen Apple Health is enabled:\n- your weight will automatically import and export when you login and when you view your user profile\n- nutrition information will automatically export for meals marked \"I ate this\" when they are first viewed in the app and as you edit them\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.eatthismuch.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of use: https://www.eatthismuch.com/terms/"

      "label": "The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) – in its capacity as the central federal institution for public health and as the German national public health institute – publishes the Corona-Warn-App on behalf of the German government The app serves as a digital complement to distancing, hygiene and wearing masks. Additionally, it provides a functionality to add your digital vaccination certificates to prove your vaccination status. It uses Bluetooth technology and the Apple Exposure Notification APIs. The app is designed to help break infection chains by informing you if you were recently close to someone who subsequently tested positive for corona. However, at no time does it collect any personal information. Who you are and where you are remain secret – and your privacy is well-protected.\n\nHOW THE APP WORKS\n\nExposure logging is the core of the app and should always be active. When enabled, smartphones exchange encrypted random IDs with other devices using Bluetooth. \n\nThe random IDs only provide information about the duration and distance of an encounter. No one is able to identify the person behind these IDs. The Corona-Warn-App does not collect any information about the location of the encounter or that of its users.\n\nBased on maximum corona incubation times, the random IDs your smartphone collects are stored in an exposure log for 14 days and then deleted. If a person is diagnosed with corona and chooses to share his/her own smartphone’s random IDs, all persons previously encountered will then be notified anonymously.\n\nNo one will know when, where or with whom the exposure event took place. The infected person remains anonymous.\n\nIn addition to the exposure notifications, affected users will receive clear recommendations for action. Important: Information about the notified persons is not accessible at any time.\n\nHOW YOUR DATA IS PROTECTED\n\nThe Corona-Warn-App is designed to be your daily companion, without knowing your identity. This is why the app cannot tell anyone who you are. Data protection is fully guaranteed throughout the app’s entire service life.\n\n• No registration required: No email address and no name need to be submitted.\n• No personal information is transmitted: When you encounter another person using the app, your smartphones only exchange random IDs. They measure the time and distance of an encounter, but do not allow to identify persons or find out locations.\n• Decentralized storage: Data is stored only on the smartphone itself and deleted after 14 days.\n• No third-party access: Neither the person reporting a proven corona infection, nor those who have been notified can be traced – not by the German government, the Robert Koch Institute, any other user, nor by Apple.\n\nThis app is not intended for any use outside of Germany. Corona-Warn-App is the main corona app for Germany, where it is interconnected with the national health care system. Despite of the above, Corona-Warn-App is also available in this country. It is provided for anyone living, working, vacationing, or visiting Germany regularly or for an extended period of time.\n\nThe terms of use for the Corona-Warn-App apply: https://www.coronawarn.app/assets/documents/cwa-eula-en.pdf. By installing and using this app, you accept these terms of use."

This allowed us to precisely record the movements and transfer them onto our 3d models, allowing you to see the exact form and timing of the exercise.\n- Detailed Exercise Descriptions: Read exactly how to do any exercise with advanced tips and breathing techniques\n- Workout Tracker : Accurately track all your workout sets in a gorgeous easy to use interface.\n- Progress Section : Track your progress and analyse your workouts with progress analysis charts\n- Apple Health Integration - This app integrates with the Health app. Connect GymStreak to the Health app and track your workouts and progress. \n- Automatic Workout Periodization : GymStreak automatically adjusts the weights you lift, reps, distance, time & rest times workout after each workout to improve the effectiveness of your workout plans.\n\nWe’ve built automatic workout periodization into every generated workout plan, meaning that using GymStreak, you will keep your muscles constantly surprised, allowing you to make progress at a much faster rate than you would on a standard workout program...and the best part is that GymStreak does all the tedious work and calculations for you, all you have to do is just follow the program.\n\nWhat is Workout Periodisation?\n\nPeriodizarion is a research tested approach to training used by athletes & other physical competitors of every kind. Research has shown progress improvements of up to 2.5x* in the speed of progress when a periodisation program is utilised vs a standard program that most people do. \n\nIt involves intelligently adjusting how much you lift with every workout, as well changing up the exercises that you do and how you do them.\n\nGymStreak, takes care of all of this for you, helping you get results faster than ever before.\n\n---------------------\n\n*Research Source: Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise Journal  (2011)\n\n\n-------------------------\nSubscription Information \n-------------------------\n\nAll GymStreak AI users can use the app for free by signing up to a free trial period.

      "label": "Realize a superior clean with the new revolutionized Oral-B mobile experience.\r\n\r\nStudies show that the average person brushes for only 30-60 seconds, compared to the dentist- recommended 2 minutes. Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level. The Oral-B app is your digital coach to help you brush correctly as recommended by Dental Professionals.\r\n\r\nBrush for a Clean that Wows\r\n3D Teeth Tracking and A.I. Brushing Recognition[2] guides you in real-time as you brush. This ensures you cover all areas of your mouth and surfaces of your teeth. \r\n\r\nAssess Your Brushing Habits\r\nPull up your brushing data summary after each guided brushing session and view your brush score to quickly see just how well you did. \r\n\r\nGet Personalized Coaching\r\nReceive individual coaching tips and insights tailored to your unique brushing behavior to see how you can improve the next time you brush. \r\n\r\nAccess Personalized Insights at a Glance\r\nBrowse through your personal brushing coverage to see which areas you need to pay more attention to. You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

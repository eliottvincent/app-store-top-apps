In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Miego, ramybės ir dėmesingumo praktikos „mybe“ skirtos vaikams susikaupti ryte, nusiraminti dieną ir užmigti vakare. \n\nĮsigyjantieji programėlę „mybe“ suteikia nemokamą jos prieigą ir labiausiai nerimaujantiems vaikams. Programėlės lietuviškos versijos gali nemokamai klausytis Lietuvos ligoninėse sveikstantys vaikai, ukrainietiškosios – visi ukrainiečiai. \n\nPROBLEMA\n•\tVaikai kasdien patiria skirtingų įtampų ir emocijų, su kuriomis ne visada moka susidoroti patys. \n•\tJie jaučia nerimą, vis mažiau sugeba susikaupti, valdyti emocijas, prasčiau sugeba suprasti kito ar išreikšti savo jausmus, turi miego sutrikimų.\n•\tĮtampos kyla dėl santykių su tėvais, tėvų tarpusavio santykių, skyrybų ar jų sveikatos. \n•\tVaikams atsiranda daug emocijų dėl įgūdžių stokos bendraujant su bendraamžiais. \n•\tPastaruoju metu, vis daugiau vaikų jaudinasi dėl globalių problemų, tokių kaip COVID ar karo grėsmė. \n\nSPRENDIMAS\nPraktikų klausymasis vos po kelias minutes per dieną:\n•\tMažina stresą ir nerimą,\n•\tPagerina dėmesingumą, dėmesio sutelkimą,\n•\tLeidžia ramiau reaguoti į dirgiklius, \n•\tIšmoko labiau džiaugtis gerais, būti stipresniais liūdnais gyvenimo momentais,\n•\tPagerina miego režimą ir kokybę,\n•\tLavina emocinį intelektą ir vaizduotę.\n•\tGerina atmintį, \n•\tSustiprina imunitetą, \n•\tMoko būti gerais ir pozityviais žmonėmis.\n\nTURINYS\nProgramėlėje “Mybe” rasite praktikas skirtas rytui, miegui ar tiesiog ramybei. Kurdamos telkemės į pagalbą ekspertus vaikų psichologijos ir pedagogikos, meditacijos, muzikos ir muzikos terapijos srityse ir, aišku, vaikus. Mes pačios daug mokėmės sąmoningumo, daug meditavome ir supratome, kaip svarbu atrasti sau tinkamą raminantį ir vedantį praktikų balsą. Dėl to šias praktikas profesionaliai įgarsinome skirtingais vyrų, moterų ir vaiko balsais, jas papildėme gamtos ir muzikos garsais. Jei labiau patinka susitelkti į muziką ar gamtą, programėlėje rasite ir nusiraminti padedančių įrašų be balso. \n\nDažnai mažiesiems yra sunkiau nulaikyti dėmesį. Taigi skirtingai nuo praktikų saugusiems, vaikiškosiose mes nupasakojame daugiau vaizdinių. Dėmesingumo praktikose tai padeda vaikams susitelkti į turinį. Miegui skirtose meditacijose pasakojimas padeda mintims nuklysti, vaikams įsisvajoti ir užmigti.\n\nAteityje toliau pildysime praktikų sąrašą, atsižvelgiant į tai, kokių meditacijų klauso ir su kokiomis problemomis susiduria klausytojai.\n\nPRENUMERATOS SĄLYGOS \nDalis aplikacijos turinio yra nemokama (žymima be spynelės ikonėlės), kita dalis yra mokama (žymima su spynelės ikonėle).\n1 mėn — 4,99 EUR\n3 mėn — 4 EUR/mėn.\n6 mėn — 3 EUR/mėn.\n\nVaikai, gulintys ligoninėse Lietuvoje, gauna nemokamą prieigą savaitei. Kodo ieškokite pakabinto ligoninės koridoriuose arba r@mybe.lt atsiųskite įrodymą, kad vaikas yra šiuo metu gydomas ligoninėje.\n\nPlačiau apie mus www.mybe.lt \nNaudojimo politika: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivatumo politika: https://www.mybe.lt/privatumo-politika"

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

It helps lose and control your weight and reinstating normal processes in your body that you’ve lost due to frequent eating.\n\nEven shorter fasting periods (12 hours or more) may result in weight loss, improved metabolic flexibility, and lower the risk of metabolic diseases.\n\nJust remember: IF is not a diet, fad or quick fix. It does not tell you what you can’t eat but instead asks that you eat within a specific window of time each day. This is a simple lifestyle change that will jump-start weight loss and better health by enabling your metabolic system to work as it was designed.\n\nBut many people are deterred from trying IF because they think it’s difficult and they don't know how to start. \n\nThat’s where Simple comes in. You don't have to know anything about Fasting.\n\nBecause we are not just a fasting tracker, our mission is not to offer you just an Intermittent Fasting tool. We provide you health, weight loss, and cognitive power instead. \n\nWe'll adjust your customized program, teach you what IF is, give a lot of different content, lifehacks, and advice to make IF adoption mindful and easy.\n\nYou’ll get daily support, customized guidance, expert advice, true motivation, and easy life hacks that will help you succeed. Simple will keep track of your eating habits to help you adjust your customized fasting program as needed. We will provide you with personalized insights on how to get the most out of intermittent fasting. \n\n- Customized tips and hacks delivered daily\n- Smart and flexible tracking. Start/end your fasts with one quick click\n- A step-by-step guide to intermittent fasting\n- Custom fasting protocols\n- Easy-to-use meal journal for mindful eating\n\nSimple Fasting protocols:\n- 16-Hour (16:8) Intermittent Fast\n- Circadian Rhythm Fasting\n- 18:6\n- 20:4\n- 14:10 \n- OMAD - one meal a day\n\nHEALTH APP INTEGRATION:\nSimple integrates the following data from the Health app (HealthKit) to keep track of your body status:\n\n- Steps\n- Weight\n- Water\n- Sleep\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\nGet a Simple PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION and enjoy full access to all features and content.\n\nIf you choose a Simple PREMIUM subscription in the app, payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

Programėlė apima daug aktualių klausimų, kurie svarbūs savo psichine ir fizine sveikata besirūpinantiems žmonėms:\r\n\r\n— kaip valdyti mintis ir emocijas;\r\n— kaip mažinti patiriamą stresą ir nerimą;\r\n— kaip lavinti psichologinį atsaprumą ir lankstumą;\r\n— kaip nusiraminti ir atstatyti vidinį balansą.\r\n\r\nVisi šie ir kiti aktualūs atsakymai integruoti į daugiau nei 18 valandų įrašų turinį. Nuosekliai ir reguliariai jų klausant, tai padeda ne tik gauti žinių ar momentiškai nusiraminti, bet kur kas daugiau - tai leidžia lavinti savistabos, emocijų ir dėmesio valdymo įgūdžius.\r\n\r\nPAUZĖ - tai ne tik programėlė.

Savonnette is there to help you understand your consumption of cosmetic products and offer you better and cleaner products for your body health and our planet's health thanks to a scan, statistics and a virtual beauty box.\n\n\nDo you want to know more about Savonnette? Here are some of the features of the application:\n\n- Your closet: If you want to understand the products composition that compose your bathroom cupboards, you just have to scan them and then save them in your closet. You can do as many as you want! This will then allow you to have statistics in order to know your consumption of harmful ingredients, follow your progress more easily and tend towards a cleaner, greener consumption, for your body heath and for our planet\n\n- A virtual beauty box: You will regularly discover, in this box, cosmetics from responsible brands that offer cleaner products that are better for your body health and for our planet. All the compositions are decrypted even in this box\n\n- A scanner to allow you to scan your cosmetic products in order to know everything about them, to know their origin: The composition, the dangerousness of the ingredients for your body health and for our planet, their origin, their function, their frequency of use. I'm also trying to teach you a little more about the composition to know how to decrypt them more easily, to act cleaner. And if you don't have the product to scan it, you can always search manually and have access to its composition.\n\n- A history: You will find there all the scans that you have done or the products that you have consulted. If you have a crush on a cleaner product just add it to favorites.\n\n- Access to all features anonymously: No account needed! And thanks to a QRcode you will always have access to your favorite products, your history, your box, your closets.\n\nAt Savonnette we want to support you towards more responsible consumption: consumption that allows you to pay attention to the health of your body but also to the health of the planet. Let me explain: In a world where we swim in information flows, where time is precious and where our body health and our planet health are most important, we want, thanks to all this information, to propose the most suitable and appropriate cosmetic products.\n\nSo do you want to participate in your well-being ?

Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level.

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

Powered by nature and innovative technology that personalizes your daily experience while keeping you in control of your cycle data.\n\n\nPainful Periods Aren't Natural\n\n\nBut they are common. Synthetic estrogens in birth control, plastics, and beauty products have created hormone imbalances for millions of women. 28's functional nutrition was designed to naturally restore balance to your hormones, along with phase-specific functional movements. \n\nWorkout With Your Cycle, Not Against It\n\n\nMany popular fitness methods were designed for men, not women, with no regard for the menstrual cycle. 28 is the first method of its kind designed to optimize your energy, hormones, strength, and flexibility as you experience changes throughout your cycle.\n\nYou Deserve More Than A Period Tracker\n\nYour cycle has four phases. Each phase brings changes to the brain and body. Exercising and eating based on your cycle means changing the types of movements and nutrients during each phase to optimize your physique, hormones, and mood. 28 empowers you with simplified science, breathtaking content, and cutting-edge technology. \n\nBecome the Expert of You\n\n\nYou are a mystery. Your body doesn’t have to be. We’ve been locked in the passenger seats of our own bodies for far too long. School taught us little-to-nothing about how our cycles and hormones actually work. 28 empowers you to connect with your body by understanding the beautifully complex nature of your biology, one day at a time.\n\n\n\nFEATURES: \n\nFollow Your Cycle\n  - Daily Cycle Status\n  - Easily Track Your Periods\n  - Phase Progress Bar \n\nScience-based Insights\n  - Daily body predictions\n  - Daily emotional predictions\n  - Goals, Guidance, and inspiration\n\nExercise Videos\n  - Personalized to match your energy and mood\n  - Designed by trainers of iconic supermodels\n  - Lengthen, strengthen, stretch & tone\n  - Sculpt booty, tighten abs, tone arms, lean legs\n  - Workout anywhere, at any time\n  - No equipment required\n  - Lightening-fast, high-definition streaming\n  - View on mobile, desktop, tablet, TV\n\nNutrition Profiles\n  - Daily nutrition guidelines for hormone balancing\n  - Specific suggestions by food groups \n  - Give your body what it needs, when it needs it\n  - No more calorie counting\n  - Coming Soon: Meal plans\n  - Coming soon: Shopping lists\n\nUser Privacy Is Our #1 Priority\n\nMany women have valid concerns regarding the privacy and safety of their personal health data. We're proud to have one of the strongest privacy policies in all of tech, which includes a steadfast commitment to never sell user cycle data to anyone for any reason and to never turn over user cycle data to any government or regulatory authority under any circumstance. We've intentionally built our algorithm to be manually controlled by the user at any time, as opposed to leveraging more invasive, machine learning methods. The only cycle data we currently collect is provided voluntarily by the user. It is also never shared with any existing or future investors. It is strictly confidential and used only for the purposes of providing a customized user experience. Any cycle data the user provides now or in the future can be changed or deleted by the user at any time. We do not store deleted cycle data. Once the user deletes that information, it is gone forever.\n\nEmbrace your nature and begin today!"

      "label": "Are you trying to quit smoking? If you are finding it hard to stop smoking, QuitNow is made for you.\n\nFirst things first: you know smoking is bad for your body. Even so, lots of people keep smoking. So why should you quit? When you quit smoking, you improve the quality and length of your life and the lives of the people around you. One way to prepare to successfully launch your smoke-free life is to power up your phone with QuitNow.\n\nQuitNow is a proven app that engages you to quit smoking. It aims to avoid tobacco just by giving you a picture of yourself. Quitting smoking is easier when you focus your effort on these four sections:\n\n- Your ex-smoker status: When you quit smoking, the focus has to be on you. Remember the day you quitted and get the maths: how many days are you free of smoke, how much money you saved, and how many cigarettes you avoided.\n\n- Achievements: your quit smoking motivations: As with all tasks in life, quitting smoking is easier when you divide the task into small and easy ones. So, QuitNow offers you 70 goals based on the cigarettes you avoided, the days since your last cigarette, and the money saved. So, you will start celebrating achievements from the first day.\n\n- Community: the ex-smokers chat: When you quit smoking, you need to stay within the non-smoking areas. QuitNow offers a chat full of people that, like you, said goodbye to tobacco. Spending time with nonsmokers will make your way easier.\n\n- Your ex-smoker health: QuitNow offers a list of health indicators to explain how your body improves day by day. They are based in the World Health Organization ones, and we update them as soon as the W.H.O. does.\n\n\nIn addition, there are more sections in the preferences screen that could help you in your way to quitting smoking.\n\n- Frequent Asked Questions: there are some tips to quit smoking, and honestly, we don’t know where to put them. Most quitters look for tips on the internet, and there are lots of fake tips there. We researched in the World Health Organization archives to find the investigations they made and the conclusions they had. In the Frequent Asked Questions, you will find all the answers to those questions you have about quitting smoking.\n\n- The QuitNow bot: sometimes, you have strange questions that don’t appear in the F.A.Q. In those cases, you can ask the bot: we train her to answer those strange ones. If she doesn’t have a good answer, she will contact the QuitNow crew and they will update their knowledge base, so she will learn the best answers to your questions. By the way, yes: all the bot answers are extracted from the W.H.O. archives, as the F.A.Q. tips.\n\n- Books to quit smoking: knowing some techniques about quitting smoking makes the task easier. There's always someone talking about books in the chat, so we made an investigation to know which are the most popular, and which ones can actually help you to quit smoking for good.\n\n\nDo you have any idea to make QuitNow even better? If so, please do write to us at ios@fewlaps.com\n\nTerms of Service: https://tos.quitnow.app/eula\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://tos.quitnow.app/privacypolicy"

Su meditacijų pagalba padėkite vaikams pažvelgti, priimti ir ramiai susitaikyti su šiomis emocijomis. \n\nMEILĖ IR GERUMAS (4)\nAuginkite vaiko viduje esantį gerumą, užuojautą ir meilę. Padėkite vaikams pajusti, kad jie yra labai mylimi, išmokykite juos pasisemti stiprybės iš jūsų teikiamos meilės. Mokykite juos mylėti save ir padėkite kurti prasmingesnius santykius su kitais žmonėmis.\n\nMENO (3)\nSkatinkite vaikus išreikšti savo mintis, emocijas ir patirtis per kūrybiškumą. Kūrybiškumu paremtos meditacijos lavins ne tik vaizduotę, bet padės geriau susikaupti ir sutelkti dėmesį.\n\n*MŪSŲ TALENTINGOSIOS AUTORĖS\n\n- Melisa Dormoi – Nacionalinės hipnotizuotojų gildijos sertifikuota hipnoterapeutė, bestselerių autorė, mokytoja ir mentorė, „ShambalaKids“ įkūrėja (www.shambalakids.com)\n- Evelina Savickaitė-Kazlauskė – ugdančioji psichologė, meno terapeutė, ugdytoja, autorė (flumens.co.uk)\n- Mišelė Roberton-Džouns – angelų terapijos specialistė ir autorė"

      "label": "Personal Zen is a game-based digital therapeutic intended to treat patients 13 years of age and older with mild to severe levels of clinically elevated anxiety or distress and is intended to be used in consultation with your healthcare provider. \n\nPersonal Zen’s core therapeutic mechanism of action is a game-based approach to a decades old area of neurocognitive research known as Attention Bias Modification (ABM). Through this proprietary approach to ABM, Personal Zen uses gamification to target neural pathways associated with emotional and attentional patterns that can drive excessive anxiety and distress.\n\nBased on your current levels of anxiety, fatigue and pain, a daily goal of gameplay is recommended (typically between 6 and 12 minutes). Play 4 times a week for at least 4 weeks to see the best results. \nYou can also access brief, science-backed tools to support your mental health journey including:\n- Journaling & mood tracking to help identify feelings and triggers\n- Breathing exercises to calm anxiety and improve sleep\n- Mindfulness practices\n\nHow Does Personal Zen Work?\nThe human brain is uniquely predisposed to unconscious, sub-second processing of facial expression. Personal Zen uses facial archetypes and gamification to re-train emotional and attentional patterns that can drive persistent feelings of anxiety and distress. Personal Zen’s proprietary game mechanics have been designed and optimized through a decade of neuroscientific research using EEG, neurostimulation, eye tracking, heart rate monitoring and MRI.\n\nPersonal Zen has been clinically validated through six randomized controlled clinical trials published in leading peer-reviewed research journals including Clinical Psychological Science, Behavior Research & Therapy, and Biological Psychology. \n\nAfter 4 weeks of usage, clinical effects have included a 38% reduction in anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), a 491% reduction in cognitive signs of anxiety (Dot-Probe Task Measure), as well as a statistically significant reduction in the stress hormone cortisol.\n\nHow Do I Play Personal Zen?\nStart by logging your levels of Anxiety, Fatigue, and Pain. A daily goal of gameplay will be recommended between 6 and 12 minutes. It is recommended that you meet this daily goal 4 days a week for at least 4 weeks. To play Personal Zen, swipe the path left by the friendly sprite (smiling face) after it disappears. A “medallion” will appear, telling you where to focus your attention next. Don’t let the angry sprite divert your focus. Unlock new regions by earning points and increasing your level. \n\nWhat experts are saying:\n“Instantly engaging for adults and kids, Personal Zen is a rare example of science turned into fun in order to reduce stress and anxiety.”\nDr. Tony Simon, Professor of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of California Davis\n“Personal Zen brings cutting-edge research and well-established strategies for reducing anxiety and stress into the palm of your hand.”\nDr. Shannon M. Bennett, Assistant Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College\n\nWe respect your privacy.

Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations not only do they help make major shifts in your mindset they also serve as prompts and daily reminders on what you are truly capable of, making sure you have an amazing day, everyday.\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your unconscious mind and your conscious mind.\nThe more you strengthen this connection the more resilient you will be when difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe.\n\nAnd the best way strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\nThere are so many benefits of using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words making it easier to recognize the negative + self-doubt thought patterns holding you back. \n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want: achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting + good you are creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen. \n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on it’s head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n\nTo have access to the \"I am Premium\" content and functionality, you can choose between a lifetime, monthly and yearly auto-renewable subscription.

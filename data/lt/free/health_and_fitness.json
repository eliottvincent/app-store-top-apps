In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

      "label": "Miego, ramybės ir dėmesingumo praktikos „mybe“ skirtos vaikams susikaupti ryte, nusiraminti dieną ir užmigti vakare. \n\nĮsigyjantieji programėlę „mybe“ suteikia nemokamą jos prieigą ir labiausiai nerimaujantiems vaikams. Programėlės lietuviškos versijos gali nemokamai klausytis Lietuvos ligoninėse sveikstantys vaikai, ukrainietiškosios – visi ukrainiečiai. \n\nPROBLEMA\n•\tVaikai kasdien patiria skirtingų įtampų ir emocijų, su kuriomis ne visada moka susidoroti patys. \n•\tJie jaučia nerimą, vis mažiau sugeba susikaupti, valdyti emocijas, prasčiau sugeba suprasti kito ar išreikšti savo jausmus, turi miego sutrikimų.\n•\tĮtampos kyla dėl santykių su tėvais, tėvų tarpusavio santykių, skyrybų ar jų sveikatos. \n•\tVaikams atsiranda daug emocijų dėl įgūdžių stokos bendraujant su bendraamžiais. \n•\tPastaruoju metu, vis daugiau vaikų jaudinasi dėl globalių problemų, tokių kaip COVID ar karo grėsmė. \n\nSPRENDIMAS\nPraktikų klausymasis vos po kelias minutes per dieną:\n•\tMažina stresą ir nerimą,\n•\tPagerina dėmesingumą, dėmesio sutelkimą,\n•\tLeidžia ramiau reaguoti į dirgiklius, \n•\tIšmoko labiau džiaugtis gerais, būti stipresniais liūdnais gyvenimo momentais,\n•\tPagerina miego režimą ir kokybę,\n•\tLavina emocinį intelektą ir vaizduotę.\n•\tGerina atmintį, \n•\tSustiprina imunitetą, \n•\tMoko būti gerais ir pozityviais žmonėmis.\n\nTURINYS\nProgramėlėje “Mybe” rasite praktikas skirtas rytui, miegui ar tiesiog ramybei. Kurdamos telkemės į pagalbą ekspertus vaikų psichologijos ir pedagogikos, meditacijos, muzikos ir muzikos terapijos srityse ir, aišku, vaikus. Mes pačios daug mokėmės sąmoningumo, daug meditavome ir supratome, kaip svarbu atrasti sau tinkamą raminantį ir vedantį praktikų balsą. Dėl to šias praktikas profesionaliai įgarsinome skirtingais vyrų, moterų ir vaiko balsais, jas papildėme gamtos ir muzikos garsais. Jei labiau patinka susitelkti į muziką ar gamtą, programėlėje rasite ir nusiraminti padedančių įrašų be balso. \n\nDažnai mažiesiems yra sunkiau nulaikyti dėmesį. Taigi skirtingai nuo praktikų saugusiems, vaikiškosiose mes nupasakojame daugiau vaizdinių. Dėmesingumo praktikose tai padeda vaikams susitelkti į turinį. Miegui skirtose meditacijose pasakojimas padeda mintims nuklysti, vaikams įsisvajoti ir užmigti.\n\nAteityje toliau pildysime praktikų sąrašą, atsižvelgiant į tai, kokių meditacijų klauso ir su kokiomis problemomis susiduria klausytojai.\n\nPRENUMERATOS SĄLYGOS \nDalis aplikacijos turinio yra nemokama (žymima be spynelės ikonėlės), kita dalis yra mokama (žymima su spynelės ikonėle).\n1 mėn — 4,99 EUR\n3 mėn — 4 EUR/mėn.\n6 mėn — 3 EUR/mėn.\n\nVaikai, gulintys ligoninėse Lietuvoje, gauna nemokamą prieigą savaitei. Kodo ieškokite pakabinto ligoninės koridoriuose arba r@mybe.lt atsiųskite įrodymą, kad vaikas yra šiuo metu gydomas ligoninėje.\n\nPlačiau apie mus www.mybe.lt \nNaudojimo politika: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivatumo politika: https://www.mybe.lt/privatumo-politika"

The difficulty lies in the journey – not the directions. This is an app where access to fitness-related information is immediately accessible and easily digested. There is no need for bloated videos or hyper marketing, just direct access to what you need to achieve your fitness goals.\n\nThis app allows you to centre in on any body part, for example, the chest, and will give you a number of exercises which will train that body part. Information is presented in both gif and descriptive form to enable an easy understanding of the exercise.\n\nAdditionally, there are tools to allow you to calculate macros and count calories in line with your goals.\n\nNOTE: This app downloads the videos to your phone as you load them. Please do so on WiFi as this may use your data plan."

Unlike specialized timers for time management, this HIIT interval timer doesn't limit you in any way and doesn't impose any productivity system.\n Numerous studies have shown that HIIT workouts burn more fat than regular training because they speed up metabolism within 24 hours after exercise. Production of growth hormone that affects the intensity of fat burning, increased up to 450%. HIIT accelerates metabolism, increases aerobic endurance, increases the level of tissue oxygen consumption."

Each meal can have different preferences, and your nutrition targets can be whatever you like.\n\nAs a premium user, we'll automatically generate a week of meal plans and send them to you with a grocery list via email. As you follow the plans, you can track what you did or didn't eat, and if you deviate from the plans, we make it easy to readjust your targets for the next week to stay on track.

      "label": "Personal Zen is a game-based digital therapeutic intended to treat patients 13 years of age and older with mild to severe levels of clinically elevated anxiety or distress and is intended to be used in consultation with your healthcare provider. \n\nPersonal Zen’s core therapeutic mechanism of action is a game-based approach to a decades old area of neurocognitive research known as Attention Bias Modification (ABM). Through this proprietary approach to ABM, Personal Zen uses gamification to target neural pathways associated with emotional and attentional patterns that can drive excessive anxiety and distress.\n\nBased on your current levels of anxiety, fatigue and pain, a daily goal of gameplay is recommended (typically between 6 and 12 minutes). Play 4 times a week for at least 4 weeks to see the best results. \nYou can also access brief, science-backed tools to support your mental health journey including:\n- Journaling & mood tracking to help identify feelings and triggers\n- Breathing exercises to calm anxiety and improve sleep\n- Mindfulness practices\n\nHow Does Personal Zen Work?\nThe human brain is uniquely predisposed to unconscious, sub-second processing of facial expression. Personal Zen uses facial archetypes and gamification to re-train emotional and attentional patterns that can drive persistent feelings of anxiety and distress. Personal Zen’s proprietary game mechanics have been designed and optimized through a decade of neuroscientific research using EEG, neurostimulation, eye tracking, heart rate monitoring and MRI.\n\nPersonal Zen has been clinically validated through six randomized controlled clinical trials published in leading peer-reviewed research journals including Clinical Psychological Science, Behavior Research & Therapy, and Biological Psychology. \n\nAfter 4 weeks of usage, clinical effects have included a 38% reduction in anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), a 491% reduction in cognitive signs of anxiety (Dot-Probe Task Measure), as well as a statistically significant reduction in the stress hormone cortisol.\n\nHow Do I Play Personal Zen?\nStart by logging your levels of Anxiety, Fatigue, and Pain. A daily goal of gameplay will be recommended between 6 and 12 minutes. It is recommended that you meet this daily goal 4 days a week for at least 4 weeks. To play Personal Zen, swipe the path left by the friendly sprite (smiling face) after it disappears. A “medallion” will appear, telling you where to focus your attention next. Don’t let the angry sprite divert your focus. Unlock new regions by earning points and increasing your level. \n\nWhat experts are saying:\n“Instantly engaging for adults and kids, Personal Zen is a rare example of science turned into fun in order to reduce stress and anxiety.”\nDr. Tony Simon, Professor of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of California Davis\n“Personal Zen brings cutting-edge research and well-established strategies for reducing anxiety and stress into the palm of your hand.”\nDr. Shannon M. Bennett, Assistant Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College\n\nWe respect your privacy.

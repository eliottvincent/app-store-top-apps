The Contraction Timer analyzes the duration and frequency of contractions and will notify you when it's time to go to the hospital.\n\nThousands of pregnant women around the world have become mothers using our app.\n\nAlways consult your doctor to orient yourself in terms of contraction frequency and duration.\nThis app is not a medical device and our recomendations are based on standard indicators. Your labor may occur differently. Therefore, do not rely exclusively on our app.\nIf the duration and frequency of contractions do not yet correspond to the necessary indicators but labor pains become unbearable, it is better to go to the hospital as soon as possible rather than give birth at home or on the way there.

The Guardian Connect system uses a tiny sensor to measure glucose levels in fluid just below the skin. It takes readings all day and night and sends them to your phone via a small wireless transmitter, so you can see how you’re doing anytime.\n\nWith the Guardian Connect mobile app, you can see your most recent glucose data, your glucose trends over time, your sensor and your transmitter status. You can also receive alerts to notify you when you’re going above or below your preferred range and keep track of daily events which may impact your glucose levels.\n\nYour mobile app also sends your data to CareLink™ Personal therapy management software, so you can see your full information online and share your information with family or friends. Those closest to you can even receive SMS messages whenever you go out of range!\n\nTo use the Guardian Connect system, you will need the Guardian Connect transmitter and sensor as well as this app!\n\n* Not compatible with MiniMed pumps."

      "label": "The application is based on the scientific research. It helps to determine the fertile days of the month, so you can either achieve or avoid pregnancy. The application uses the date of the last period and shows the date of the next period, the best days to conceive a baby, the ovulation day and when you can avoid pregnancy.\n\n* Scientific Research *\n\nThe popular baby gender prediction method is used by default. But it’s based only on the widely-spread theory by Landrum Shettles. The application also supports the scientific baby gender prediction method. It’s based on the scientific research by Rodrigo Guerrero and the statistics of thousands of women.\n\nYou can change the gender prediction method on the “Settings” screen. But remember that either gender prediction method shows only slightly higher chances of conceiving a girl or a boy and it never guarantees the result.\n\n* Full Version *\n\nThis is the full version of the application. You will be able to see the following data:\n\n- The probability of getting pregnant on the current or on any selected day.\n- The probability of conceiving a girl or a boy using the selected gender prediction method.\n- Chances of getting pregnant during the current period.\n- Chances of conceiving a girl or a boy during the current period.\n\n* How to Use *\n\nTo generate the menstrual calendar you have to provide the following data:\n\n- The first day of the last cycle (select the day and use the button “Add”).\n- Average length of the menstrual cycle (adjust it on the “Settings” screen).\n- Length of the luteal phase (most women can use the default value).\n\nThe application works best for women with regular menstrual cycle. But average cycle length is also a good way to predict when the ovulation should happen."

      "label": "Get a better idea of your general health and physical fitness level with the ECG Analyzer app + Apple Watch ECG. \nECG Analyzer integrates with Apple Health to unleash the greatest power of your Apple Watch ECG, by analyzing and calculating HRV out of your ECG data, one of the best metrics for physical fitness and overall health level.\n\nWith HRV trends you can learn your health level changes. A up hill trend means a better physical fitness level and a down hill indicates you should pay more attention to your overall health.\n\nThings you can do about your ECG data -\n1. Measure intervals and voltages on the ECG rhythm waves\n2. Calculate HRV (using RMSSD)\n3. View Poincaré plot / R-R interval plot\n4. HRV trends\n5. Generate PDF report with HRV info\n6. Send your ECG report to your healthcare provider\n\nSo what is HRV?\nHRV is a measure of your autonomic nervous system that is widely considered one of the best objective metrics for physical fitness and determining your body’s readiness to perform.\n\nAlthough HRV manifests as a function of your heart rate, it actually originates from your nervous system. Your autonomic nervous system, which controls the involuntary aspects of your physiology, has two branches, parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating).\n\nThe parasympathetic branch (often referred to as “rest and digest”) handles inputs from internal organs, like digestion or your fingernails and hair growing. It causes a decrease in heart rate.\n\nThe sympathetic branch (often called “fight or flight”) reflects responses to things like stress and exercise, and increases your heart rate.\n\nHeart rate variability comes from these two competing branches simultaneously sending signals to your heart. If your nervous system is balanced, your heart is constantly being told to beat slower by your parasympathetic system, and beat faster by your sympathetic system. This causes a fluctuation in your heart rate: HRV.\n\nTerms of use - http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula"

This App, developed by a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience, will help you reduce pain, motivate you to do your daily exercises, and keep you engaged with your recovery. \n\nCurovate provides daily video guided physical therapy exercises based on the best knee and hip surgery rehabilitation protocols and guidelines. The exercises within Curovate are based on the best evidence, as well as the clinical experience of a Physical Therapist with 20 years of experience.\n\nCurovate can measure your knee or hip joint movements (i.e, range of motion), at home with no special equipment. Curovate requires nothing more than your phone to give you an accurate range of motion measurement in a few seconds - watch the video to see how simple it is! The app also provides progress tracking for every repetition and set of exercise that you complete, shows you your achievements daily, weekly and monthly, and rewards you with badges for your hard work. \n\nThe ultimate goal of knee and hip surgery is to return to the sports and physical activity you love and to get back to your normal life and Curovate can help you achieve these goals.\n\nACL Injury or Surgery - Curovate can be used by people after an ACL injury by selecting the pre-surgery option in the app, or if not planning to have surgery, by selecting the non-operative ACL option in the app. \n\nCurovate is a physical therapy app for people who have had a patellar tendon graft or a hamstring tendon graft used to repair their ACL. Many people also have had a cadaver graft, or  a graft taken from a deceased person, or a quadriceps tendon graft. All of the research states that the rehabilitation and exercises that people need to do after a cadaver or quadriceps tendon graft for an ACL repair is the same as a patellar tendon graft rehabilitation protocol.\n\nTotal Knee Replacement - this is when your entire knee joint is replaced with artificial parts. This is done for people who have osteoarthritis in their knee and they are limited by pain and inability to do their daily activities. If this is you, then Curovate can help.\n\nCurovate provides specific daily and weekly physical therapy exercises to help you recover. You can also measure the exact angle or range of motion of your new knee joint to make sure you are meeting your goals and staying on track for your recovery. The joint replacement of your knee is just the first important step to achieving pain free function of your knee. Now it is crucial that you continue daily exercises to get stronger after surgery. You can do this by starting your knee replacement rehab at home.\n\nThe exercises in the app were developed from rehabilitation guidelines and knee replacement protocols all clearly referenced in the app and 20 years of clinical experience from a physical therapist. Tracking your exercise repetitions, sets and your overall progress is also done by the app so you don’t have to track your daily recovery on paper. If you have questions about if this app can help you after surgery, please email the physical therapist and CEO of Curovate, Nirtal Shah at nirtal@curovate.com\n\nStart your 5 day trial today!\n\nSubscription terms of use:\nYou may purchase an auto-renewing subscription through an In-App Purchase.\n• Auto-renewable subscription\n• 1 month ($8.99 USD), Annual subscription ($45.99 USD)\n• Your subscription will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and will automatically renew (at the duration selected) unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• Current subscription may not be cancelled during the active subscription period; however, you can manage your subscription and/or turn off auto-renewal by visiting your iTunes Account Settings after purchase.\n\n• Privacy policy: https://curovate.com/privacypolicy.html\n\n• Subscription terms: https://curovate.com/terms.html"

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!"

      "label": "*Reach your goals*\n\nStarting to learn anatomy can be overwhelming, but it shouldn't be. Daily Anatomy can be used without any prior knowledge. It starts with the basics, and challenges your brain more and more over time. Learning with  Daily Anatomy is not only about repetition. It introduces information in varying forms. Solving a problem in different ways helps you memorize information longer-term and finally be able to fully absorb it. Whether on your next exam, or in your medical professional career, all the anatomy structures will be at hand. No more thinking. Just knowing.\n\n*What will you learn?*\n\nWith Daily Anatomy you learn all the important structures of human anatomy. This includes bones, muscles, nerves, vessels and specific points on the bones. Each muscle is shown in both its neutral and functional positions so you implicitly learn the main functions as you go along.\n\nInstead of many thin arrows pointing at various structures, each structure is clearly highlighted in its entirety. This way you can easily identify and memorize both shape and location.\n\n*How to stay motivated and not forget*\n\nWhether you need to learn lists of information, or for instance, every muscle and bone in the human body including how they function together, there is a method really works to help you out. The bonus is that this method doesn't stress you out either because you get to take lots of breaks.\n\nIt's called spaced repetition, and it's the way to go for knowledge that sticks in your cranium.\n\nBy using spaced repetition, you work through a series of increasing intervals of time between studying what you've previously learned. This method utilizes the psychological spacing effect, which occurs when you are going back over information that you have already learned in order to remember it better. Spaced repetition works well for lists of items or new vocabularies such as medical terminology.\n\nDaily Anatomy has built-in spaced repetition, so you learn as efficiently and effectively as you can."

A mother’s life changes dramatically with the birth of her baby. It is so important for a mother and her newborn baby to establish a comfortable breastfeeding relationship.  Moms need to keep track of which breast to offer her baby, how long the baby suckles at each breast, the number of times the baby breastfeeds each day, how many wet diapers and bowel movements the baby has, how long and frequently the baby sleeps, as well as the baby’s weight and growth.  All of this information is important for the self-assessment of breastfeeding and for assessing the growth of the child.  Having this information easily accessible will be extremely useful when visiting with your pediatrician or lactation consultant.\n\nIt is important to record all of this data. Do not rely on your memory, because even the most organized mothers are often lost in the sea of information about their newborn.\n\nUse the features of the Breastfeeding application.\n\nBreastfeeding and pumping:\n- record the time and quantity of feedings and/or pumpings;\n- note which breast was fed or pumped last to ensure starting new feeding/pumping on the opposite breast;\n- record the duration of feeding/pumping;\n- pause feeding/pumping, if necessary;\n- quickly add feeding/pumping session that was similar to the most recent but updates with the current time\n- use the maximum duration of feeding setting and the application will stop recording the feeding/pumping at the set time if you are unable to press stop\n\nLiquids:\n- consider all of your child’s fluid intake (water, expressed breast milk, formula, juice, etc.);\n -track your child’s reactions to new fluids and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers;\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nFeeding (solid food):\n- add solid foods as your child begins eating them (cereal, vegetables, fruits, meat, fish);\n- track your child’s reactions to these new foods and leave comments for yourself and other caregivers\n- set the default fluid volume (can be edited as needed);\n\nSleep:\n- record the time and duration of your baby’s sleep each day so you can better plan your day;\n- compare your baby’s sleep habits with recommended sleep guidelines\n\nDiapers: \n- track the number of your baby’s wet and/or dirty diapers. This information is crucial for noticing signs of dehydration, constipation, and diarrhea and alerting the child’s pediatrician if necessary.\n\nMeasurements: \n- track height and weight to evaluate your baby’s development;\n\nOther features:\n- edit or delete events as needed;\n- set reminders for various events; \n- use the application in your native language;\n- select your preferred units of measurement;\n- view statistics;\n- enter data for several children and twins;\n- backup all of your data;\n\nAlso available in PRO-version:\n- disable advertising;\t\n- auto backup every 24 hours;\t\n---\nWe offer subscription plans in the app that unlock premium functions of the app:\n- Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n- Price can depend on location\n\nFor more information please visit the link https://support.apple.com/HT202039\nPrivacy Policy: https://doc.whisperarts.com/policy/breastfeeding/ios/\nTerms of Use: https://doc.whisperarts.com/terms/breastfeeding/ios/"

      "label": "The #1 medical simulation on the App Store!  Full Code challenges you to take on complex clinical cases in a realistic 3D emergency room.  Whether you are a medical student, resident, paramedic, nurse, PA or experienced physician you will enjoy the challenge of solving Full Code cases.  Our library includes over 105 scenarios with a mix of common occurrences, trauma cases, pediatric cases, life-threatening illnesses and obscure diseases that you may only see once or twice in your career.  We add 2 new scenarios each month and we frequently cover clinical hot-topics.  Earn CME credit hours with realistic medical simulation.\n\nCLINICAL PRACTICE\nBegin by taking a history and performing a physical exam, then click on equipment in the virtual resuscitation bay to order tests and perform interventions. Choose amongst a host of drugs, bedside tests, labs, and imaging to help you narrow the differential diagnosis.  Our physiology engine will change the vitals based on your interventions and the patient’s condition just as they would in real life.  While you zero in on the final diagnosis and definitively treat the patient you can consult with specialists and nursing staff for assistance, but the patient’s survival rests in your hands.  \n\nPERSONALIZED ASSESSMENT\nAt the end of each case, you receive a score in six core clinical competencies to guide your continuing education.  Run through the case as many times as you like to improve your score and hone your resuscitation skills.  After each attempt you have the choice of revealing partial answers which can give you valuable insight into the correct diagnosis.  By revealing the full case answer you gain access to our detailed debrief notes which walk you through each case’s essential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required to save the patient.  Finally, we provide you with further reading through high-quality relevant web-links and references related to each case.\n\nCASE DESIGN \nThe Full Code team prioritizes environmental fidelity in every case and we strive to replicate the complexity of managing critically ill patients from presentation to disposition.  The medical content of each case is created by our team of emergency physicians lead by James Kimo Takayesu, a Harvard faculty member and ED attending at Massachusetts General Hospital with 15 years of experience training emergency medicine residents. He has received 16 teaching awards in his career for educational innovation and bedside teaching. Each case is peer reviewed twice, and our team continuously updates our clinical content to reflect the best in clinical and educational practice. \n\nFOLLOW FULL CODE\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinervaMedical/ \nTwitter: @FullCodeApp\nWeb: https://fullcodemedical.com"

With our multi award-winning app, it’s easy: retrieve any anatomical structure and relevant clinical information in an instant. Search through 1000s of anatomical structures such as ligaments, tendons, arteries, veins, organs, and glossary items. Browse by system layers including skin, skeletal, connective tissue, muscular, circulatory, digestive, reproductive, lymphatic, respiratory, urinary and more…\n \n“User Interface: This is really what separates this app from the rest. Easy and high resolution zooming and movement. Navigating the body couldn't be easier. Of all the anatomy apps I've seen this is definitely one of the best.”  *****\n \n“Thinking of you: All the anatomy apps have the blue dots with information, but with Pocket Anatomy you can click on a muscle and it will give you origin, insertion, key relations, functions (actions), nerve and blood supply, and clinical perspectives”  *****\n \nWhy? The following unique combination of features makes Pocket Anatomy the superior Anatomy and Physiology product in the marketplace (Please note: a subscription is needed to access the app content.)\n \n1. INTUITIVE SEARCH\nConfusion is easy when it comes to anatomy terms. With our intuitive search option it will suffice to type in only the first characters of the word you are looking for, or one of the words composing the main term. E.g. If you type in “trap” you will get “trapezoid” as well as “coracoclavicular-trapezoid ligament”. The more letters you type the more refined the search.\n \n2. INTUITIVE NAVIGATION\nFly around the male and female human body by swiping your finger on the screen, fluidly navigating from the skin layer through the superficial to deep musculature, and on through to internal organ structures, ligaments and the skeletal system.\n \n3. RICH CONTENT\nPocket Anatomy includes full 3D male and female anatomy as well as detailed stand alone visual information on circulatory, connective tissue, digestive, integumentary, lymphatic, muscular, reproductive, respiratory, skeletal and urinary systems.\n \n4. CLINICAL RELEVANCE\nAnatomical structures in each layer are pinned for identification. Each pin is associated with additional concise relevant information and clinical notes.\n \n5. GREAT STUDY TOOL\nStudying for your next Anatomy and Physiology exam? Add your notes next to a pin, bookmark the content you are interested in and retrieve it every time you need it. Test your knowledge with your classmates or challenge yourself with our quizzes.\n \n6. YOU’RE IN GOOD COMPANY\n \n***** \"This BEAUTIFUL app offers mobile medical education for students.\"\n~ Apple iTunesU\n \n***** “EXCELLENT visuals and seamless 3D navigation”\n~ MedGadget\n \n***** “Renders the old text-book pretty close to obsolete” ~ CNET\n \n \n7.

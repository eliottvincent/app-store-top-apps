There are several online directories where you can find the stations featured in the app.\n\nQ: Why does the music occasionally skip?\nA: When songs are skipping, it is often because 1) that station's server has recently been reset or 2) the internet isn't filling the audio buffer fast enough. Usually these issues are resolved with faster internet, changing to a new station, or they resolve on their own after the server resets.\n\nQ: Why are some stations blank at times? \nA: Some of these stations are controlled by real DJs and if they aren't playing anything at the time or their site is down no music will play. Fortunately we have a variety of channels so you will always have a lot to choose from. \n\nFor more information, including Terms of Service & Privacy Policy, visit myindieapp.com.

At any time, use the History tool to quickly rewind and undo your changes.\n\nA MAGIC TOUCH TO NOTES\nFrom simply adding a note to complex multi-note editing, each interaction was carefully designed with touch in mind. And with over 300 instruments available to Members, you can quickly try out different sounds and find your style.\n\nAMPLIFIED AUDIO\nEdit, snap, and trim your audio clips to your liking. Record or import audio, or use a sample from Medly’s vast audio library. You can record audio up to 4 bars or become a Member and record and import audio up to 30 seconds. As a Member, bring your songs to the next level with professionally recorded vocals by Medly’s talented artists.\n\nPOINT PERFECT AUTOMATION\nAutomatically change volume, echo, and other effects to add fades and pitch bends to your sounds. Snap between points and beats to achieve point perfect precision and use the selection tool to edit multiple automation points together. Then open the effect picker to quickly see the automation graphs of all effects within a Section.\n\nSHARE AND PLAY\nQuickly upload your songs to SoundCloud, or share it as a video, audio, MIDI, or Medly file. You can also connect Medly to other apps using Inter-App Audio or play in time using Ableton Link.\n\nMADE IN CANADA\nWe’re a small team working relentlessly to make Medly possible. We’d love to know what you think about Medly, let us know on Facebook, Twitter, or email us at hi@medlylabs.com\n\n\n*iPad App of the Year: Japan and South Korea\n*iPhone App of the Year Runner-Up: China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan\n\nhttps://medlylabs.com/legal"

Every round presents a new way to think about your music and a reason to share the songs you love, the songs you always thought deserved more love, or the songs you find that perfectly fit the theme.  \n\nSample themes could include: \n- Best cover song\n- Beach Songs\n- Song I learned from TikTok\n- Best song of 2022 so far\n- Best song you've seen performed live\n- Songs to sing in the shower\n- Instrumentals\n \nGameplay:\n- Players submit a song that matches a theme\n- The app will create an anonymous, shuffled Spotify playlist (an Spotify account is required.  A free account works, but note that Spotify will add songs to any playlist with less than 15 songs)\n- Players vote for which songs they like best or that fits the theme best\n- Players can comment on songs as they vote\n- When the votes are in, you are able to see who submitted which songs and all of the comments that were left\n- A champion is crowned for each round… updating the leaderboard along the way\n- An overall champion for each Music League is named after the last round\n- You’ll also see who gave you the most love…and the least!\n \nFeatures:\nMusic League is always evolving. Features have been added along the way and more will be coming."

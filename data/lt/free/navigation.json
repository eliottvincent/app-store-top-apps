That's why Moovit has been named one of the best apps of the year in 2017 by the App Store.\n\nMoovit is your personal assistant for all your transit rides! \n\n► Real-time arrivals. View real-time arrival information, which is taken directly from GPS devices positioned on buses and trains. Avoid wasting time guessing train times or bus times.\n\n► Digital payment. Purchase bus & train tickets and validate your digital pass with a tap (select cities). \n\n► Real time alerts. Know about issues ahead of time by receiving service alerts such as emergency or unexpected disruptions, delays, traffic jams, new construction, and more so that you can plan ahead if your bus time or train time changed.\n\n► Live Directions. Get step-by-step bus directions and other transit directions with live guidance from A-to-B: Know how long you need to walk to your station, view your line's arrival time, receive get-off alerts as you approach your destination, and more. \n\n► Visualize Your Stop. Use augmented reality to locate your bus or train stop with \"Way Finder\".\n\n► User reports. Moovit’s users report issues found with stations, line service, and schedules so that we can inform all nearby riders about what’s going on in their area.\n\n► Favorite lines, stations, and places. Get easy access to lines, stations, and places you ride and visit all the time. Plus, get real-time updates if/when there are changes to your favorite lines in case your bus time or train time is impacted!\n\n► Bike routes. Get bike routes in addition to the bus, subway, train, or metro trip plans. If you ride bikes (yours or shared) we can plan a route that includes the train or bus. Moovit will help you plan a trip that meets your transit-needs. Bike docking stations are updated in real-time. Bike trip plans are only available in supported metro areas.\n\n► Maps view. Interested in seeing the whole picture? View all stations, routes, and lines on the subway or bus map. Additionally, maps are available in PDF for when you’re offline, or underground on the subway. \n\nMoovit is the #1 urban mobility app in the world. We’re proud to collaborate with public transit agencies across the United States, including:\nMTA\nNJ Transit\nMBTA\nSEPTA\nLA Metro\nSFMTA Muni\nBART\nCaltrain\nCTA\nMetra\nWMATA\nMTA Maryland\nTriMet\nSound Transit\nSARTA\nPARTA\n\nYou only need one app on your phone to navigate nearby buses and transit in the U.S. and across 112 other countries and in 45 languages. If you’d like to know bus times and train times all around the world or if you need to find out when the last bus leaves a certain bus stop Moovit has you covered. You ride, we guide!\n\nContact us: \n* https://support.moovitapp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=175869\n* https://www.facebook.com/moovit\n* https://twitter.com/moovit\n\nTerms of Use\nhttps://moovitapp.com/en-us/legal/terms-of-service-en"

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

      "label": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map.\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 20,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once - no clustering here!\nSimply tap on a ship to see it's name, type and destination. Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period.

Das schafft erhebliche Hindernisse für Lokalhistoriker und Liebhaber der Antike. Vetus Maps löst dieses Problem! Jetzt alle notwendigen Alte-Karten der Landkreise und Provinzen in Ihrem Smartphone. Die Anwendung ermöglicht es Ihnen, die alte Karte auf die entsprechnede moderne Karte zu übertragen.\n\nAnwendungsmerkmale:\n\n- Übertragung auf eine moderne Karte (Satellit, Hybrid, Gelände)\n- Änderung der Transparenz der Karte\n- Kartenkatalog zum Herunterladen\n- Markierungen setzen\n- GPS-Tracks aufzeichnen\n- Suche nach Orten\n\nAuf den alten Karten ist eine große Anzahl verschiedener Objekte angegeben, die man als wertvolle Datenquelle für die Toponymie verwenden kann, da viele Namen verloren gegangen sind - sie sind auf keiner topographischen topografischen Karte zu finden. Selbst in unserer heutigen Zeit, viele Jahre später, kann man mit Hilfe dieser Karten recht sicher durch die Landschaft navigieren.\n\nAlte Karten sind immer offline verfügbar, für Satellitenkarten ist eine Internetverbindung erforderlich. Die Markerinstallation erfolgt durch langes Drücken auf die Karte\n\nPremium Abonnement:\nMit dem Jahresabonnement erhalten Sie Zugang zu allen Karten zum kostenlosen Download und können auch Karten von Drittanbietern oder Ihre eigenen Karten mit Dropbox herunterladen. Die Zahlung für den ersten Abonnementzeitraum wird Ihrem iTunes-Konto bei Bestätigung des Kaufs belastet. Der Preis ist regional unterschiedlich und beträgt nun 14,99 € pro Jahr.\n\nIhr Abonnement wird automatisch jedes Jahr bzw. jeden Monat zum gültigen Abonnementpreis verrechnet, und dieser Betrag wird 24 Stunden vor Ende des Jahres-/Monats-Abonnements von Ihrem Konto abgehoben. Um Ihr Abonnement zu verwalten oder die automatische Verlängerung zu beenden, gehen Sie einfach zu Ihren Kontoeinstellungen und inaktivieren Sie die automatische Erneuerung mindestens 24 Stunden vor dem Verlängerungsdatum. Nach Berechnung der Jahres-Abonnements können keine Rückzahlungen mehr erfolgen. Jeglicher unverbrauchte Anteil der Probezeit verfällt bei Kauf eines Abonnements. Für weitere Informationen, sehen Sie bitte die Benutzungsbedingungen (http://www.vetusmaps.com/termsofuse.pdf) und die Datenschutzerklärung ein (http://www.vetusmaps.com/privacypolicy.pdf).\n\nDie Aufnahme von GPS-Tracks läuft im Hintergrund. Die fortgesetzte Verwendung von GPS im Hintergrund kann die Akkulaufzeit Ihres Geräts erheblich verkürzen."

Auch mit Ihrem PKW kommen Sie dank der P+R\nRoutenführung immer optimal ans Ziel. Kaufen Sie schnell und bequem ausgewählte VGN-\nTickets - und wenn Sie möchten - gleich direkt aus der Verbindungsauskunft. Übrigens, in\nNürnberg wird inzwischen jeder vierte Einzelfahrschein über diese App erworben.\n\nGeben Sie für Start und Ziel eine Haltestelle, eine Adresse, einen wichtigen Punkt an,\nverwenden Sie Ihre aktuelle Position oder wählen Sie einen Kontakt (optional), und Sie\nerhalten alle wichtigen Informationen für die nächsten Verbindungen. Teilen Sie Ihre\nVerbindung ganz einfach mit Freunden oder speichern Sie sie im Kalender.\n\nFunktionen\n• Live Auskunft mit Echtzeitdaten\n• Verbindungen von Haustür zu Haustür\n• Routenplanung mit P+R Parkplätzen\n• Anzeige von Belegungen der P+R Parkplätze\n• Fahrtdetails während der Fahrt aktualisieren\n• Schnellzugriff zum aktuellen Ticket direkt aus der Auskunft\n• Abfahrten einer beliebigen Haltestelle\n• Preis- und Tarifinformationen zu jeder Verbindung\n• Ticketkauf\n• Detaillierte Karten und Netzpläne\n• Aktuelle Informationen zu Fahrplanänderungen\n• Einstellbare Benachrichtigung bei Störungen\n\nSie haben die Möglichkeit, der App in den Einstellungen den Zugriff auf Ihre Kontakte zu\nerlauben, um damit möglichst einfach die dort hinterlegten Adressen als Start oder Ziel zu\nverwenden. Bei Auswahl eines Kontakts wird nur die ausgewählte Adresse an das\nAuskunftssystem des VGN gesendet. Unsere Fahrplanauskunft kann dabei nicht\nunterscheiden, ob die Adresse aus den Kontakten stammt oder manuell eingegeben wurde.\nDeshalb benötigt die App unter anderem die Berechtigung für Kontakte.\n\nDarüber hinaus ist zur Nutzung aller Funktionen der Auskunft und zum Kauf eines Tickets\neine Internetverbindung notwendig. Für die automatische Verwendung einer nahegelegenen\nHaltestelle ist die Aktivierung der Ortungsfunktion erforderlich.\n\nAlle Angaben und Auskünfte ohne Gewähr."

In-App purchase can be used to remove the bottom advertisement and to support us.\n\nThis application does not need an internet connection and works best in outdoors.\n\nBy default, it uses device sensor to determine the elevation from see level, but you also have the option to use NOAA data files to get the altitude of your location. On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "Moscow Metro\n\nNew convenient routes\n\nWith the updated Moscow Metro app, it has become even easier to build routes around the metro and the city! We have increased the launch speed of the service by 3 times, and also changed the principle of navigation.\n\nBuild routes around the metro and the city taking into account your preferences: the fastest or with the least number of transfers.\n\nWith the help of new filters, you will find out at which stations you can drink coffee, buy flowers and much more.\n\nNow Mosmetro passengers will be able to find out about the occupancy of the cars of the incoming train. The station card will display a train informing about the occupancy of each car in real time. And also added a function that shows how long the train will arrive.\n\nWhen you select a station, a card appears in the application where you can view useful information about it. If, for example, an escalator is being repaired nearby, you will be able to see the details of these works, including the timing.\n\nMetro exits and nearby transport are combined into a single block so that passengers can easily find their stop. This is complemented by a map of the city, with which it is easy to build a further path if the user prefers walking.\n\nCity\n\nThe city map has become much better and more informative. Now you can build routes on public transport, car or bicycle on the city map and follow them. Also added useful features such as traffic jams, search by category, save favorite places to favorites, view the history of your routes and much more.\n\nPassenger's personal account\n\nThe application now has a personal account where you can manage the Troika card online.\nNow, when linking the Troika card to an account in your personal account, do not worry about losing the card – the balance can be transferred to another card.\nSet up automatic replenishment or notification of a decrease in the card balance.\nGet points under the loyalty program \"City\" for replenishing the \"Troika\" card.\nKeep a history of trips and operations performed.\n\n\nChatbot of Alexander\n\nEverything you wanted to know about the subway, but didn't know where to ask. Our chatbot will quickly and amiably answer any questions online.\n\nNow passengers will not need to waste time searching for the necessary information. In a matter of seconds, a virtual interlocutor will help you make an application for the maintenance of the Central control center and the warehouse of forgotten things, give a historical reference about the metro, tell you about the operating mode of stations and closures during repairs, tell you all the necessary addresses and contacts, connect you with the operator if you do not want to communicate with artificial intelligence, and much more.\n\nAlexandra will continue to study, combining it with her main job. We will definitely report on her skills.\n\nOther updates\n\nA dark theme has appeared in the application.\n\nThe news section has been updated. Now the news is divided into 3 categories:\n\nImportant, where up-to-date information about restrictions on metro lines is collected;\n\nNews, where the latest news related to the Moscow Metro will be published\n\nThe official Twitter account of the Moscow Metro for operational information about the work of the metro."

Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

Droneradar premium has been deprecated. All Premium features are now available in the Freemium version. !!!\n\nDroneradar is an official application enabling drone operators to find their way in the complicated maze of aviation regulations. The application is integrated with PansaUTM administered by the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency. The application is supported by the Polish Civil Aviation Office (ULC). \n\n!!! REMEMBER TO FOLLOW TIPS provided by Air Traffic Services!!!\n\n!!! Please be sure, you enable notifications !!!\n!!! Turn on location service on your phone during application installation !!!\n\nCongratulations on purchasing your new unmanned aircraft, often called drone, RPAS, UAV, or BSP.\n\nWith the first flight, you will join the group of airspace users. Despite its small size, your unmanned aerial vehicle is an aircraft with all its associated consequences.\n\nThe most important rules of unmanned aerial vehicle movement:\n\n- If you are flying a drone over 250gr. or any drone with a camera, register at drony.ulc.gov.pl or on the Webpage of your CAA (Civil Aviation Authority). Enter the received Drone Operator Registration number in the Droneradar application during flight Check-In.\n- Obey the rules. The iconographic images in the application illustrate what you can and what you cannot. Check their meaning out on the droneradar.eu\n- Minimize the risk associated with a possible failure of your drone\n- Be mind always \"in front of the drone\". Don't let the drone get ahead of your intentions\n- Never fly near airports (the lights in the application will tell you how close you are to the airport and whether you can fly your unmanned aerial vehicle);\n- Fly in sight;\n- Do not fly higher than 120 m. (Approx. 450 ft) AGL (Above Ground Level) in Open category. AGL stands for Over Terrain. 150 m. AGL is the minimum altitude for manned aircraft. They may not notice your drone;\n- Although it is not compulsory, buy liability insurance\n\nAre these rules enough to fly safely? Not always! You must be aware of existing air structures.\n\nUsing the Droneradar application, you can quickly and easily check if you can fly in a given place and time. Droneradar will inform you about other space users.\n\nHow does Droneradar work?\nRun the application, allow location services and observe the color of the lights at the top of the screen.\n\nGREEN - you can fly with attention to the height declared in the application.\nYELLOW - there are restrictions. You can check them by clicking the signaller icon at the top of the screen. There you will find a phone number for airspace managers.\nRED - no flights.\n\nCheck-In flight location registration\nTo inform other space users about your flights, click the Check-In. Enter your contact details and the type of drone you control. This information is voluntary, so it is worth it to be true. Confirm location. Your flying are will be marked on the Droneradar map for the indicated time.\n\nIf a flight plan is required at the selected location, log in to PansaUTM at https://utm.pansa.pl and follow the instructions.\n\nSafe and fun flights!\nDroneradar team\n\ndlapilota.pl / droneradar Sp. z o.o. the creator of the application and reserves the right to disable the service and / or update it at any time."

      "label": "Ever wondered what ship it is you see passing a few miles off the beach?? This App gives you the ability to find out all the details of the ship, including size, speed, course, destination, estimated time of arrival and much more. All done with an easy to use and great looking App, which supports both iPhone and iPad.\n\nWhat people are saying about our App: \"Best user interface of any ship app I have tried\" B. Colson, Maine. \"Love the graphical design and the large icons that makes it easy to determine the ship type\" R. Clark, London. \n\nOpenSeaMap data is now accessible from within the app giving the possibility of showing the map data delivered by OpenSeaMap which includes seamarks, navigational rules and buoys in many areas of the world.\n\nFurthermore, you may measure the distance to the ships from your position, as you may measure distance between any two ships. This will show you if they are really on collision course or if it's just an illusion.\n\nSee the ships displayed on the map with large and crystal clear icons.\n\nBuilt-in compass and \"direction\" vector which helps find the direction of the ships and vessels. \n\nFurthermore, images of the ships may be watched or uploaded directly from the app.\n\nThis version supports iOS split screen multitasking found on selected device.\n\nAlso we added the possibility to place user defined waypoints on the map (press and hold your finger on map). The waypoints can be used as measurement points from the user or between ships. Furthermore, by pressing the waypoint the position is copied to the clipboard, making it easy to paste positions into other applications. Pressing the callout of the waypoint will prepare a text message with the position ready to send to other users.Once the text message is received the user can press it and get the position up in various maps apps. This functionality has been requested by search and rescue workers who would like a tool to help pin point positions to colleagues out at sea.\n\nMake sure to check out our FREE version of the app (Trackaship Superlite) before buying if in doubt about the coverage of you local area. The free version will show the same ships, but not any details.\n\nThis app depends on the data received via the Internet and is dependent on the Internet for displaying data. \n\nData is collected on a voluntary basis and may change without notice. If you live in an area with poor or no coverage, you have possibility to improve the situation. Send an email to bbmtrackers@gmail.com and we will contact you. \n\nPlease note that the accuracy and reliability of data in this app are not covered by any guarantee and that, under no circumstances should be used for navigation. This app is no substitute for proper maritime instruments."

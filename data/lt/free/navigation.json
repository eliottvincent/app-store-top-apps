      "label": "iMapp will help you track your friends and relatives who are connected to the service as well as assist you in finding a person's location by request, regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed.\n\nNow, you no longer need to call each other dozens of times to arrange a meeting, you can simply view each other’s locations via a phone number. If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

      "label": "Makes from your iPhone/iPad a complete GPS device with detailed topographic maps. Viewed maps will be stored on your device so that Topo GPS can also be used offline.\n\nWhy should you buy an expensive GPS device if you can install Topo GPS? Topo GPS contains all functions of a regular GPS device for less money, has a much more detailed map, and is more convenient to operate. The accuracy of the position determination is in favorable conditions about 5 m.\n\nIdeal for walking, hiking, cycling, mountain biking, sailing, horse-riding, geocaching, scouting, trail running and other outdoor activities. Also suited for outdoor professionals.\n\n- Map\n* To use Topo GPS you need to buy a map.\n* Official topographic maps of many countries, including Great Britain (OS Explorer), New Zealand and Australia are available as in-app purchase. \n* Topographic maps are very detailed maps, include height contours and are very suited for outdoor activities.\n* All maps of a certain region can be made offline accessible using the map download screen.\n* Easy switching between maps.\n\n- Routes\n* Recording routes, with pause and restart possibility.\n* Planning routes via route points.\n* Generating routes\n* Editing routes\n* Synchronization with your other devices via iCloud.\n* Searching routes with filters.\n* Routes can be organized into folders.\n\n- Waypoints\n* Easy adding by pressing long on map.\n* Adding waypoints through address or coordinates.\n* Sharing waypoints.\n* Editing waypoints.\n\n- Layers\nLayers contain information that can be added to and removed from the map.\n* Long distance bicycle routes\n* Mountainbike routes\n\n- Coordinates\n* Easy entering coordinates\n* Scanning coordinates\n* Supported coordinate systems:\nWGS84 decimal, WGS84 degree minutes (seconds), UTM, MGRS, and other country specific coordinate systems.\n* Coordinates grid layers\n\n- Intuitive interface\n* Clear menu with most important functions.\n* Different dashboard panels with distance, time, speed, altitude and coordinates.\n* Clear manual at www.topo-gps.com\n\n- Supported file formats:\n* gpx, kml/kmz, geojson (all also zip compressed), WFS, csv\n\n\nIf you are recording a route, the GPS will run in the background. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nRdzl, the company behind Topo GPS, does not obtain in any way the position of the user of Topo GPS. Rdzl does also not obtain the routes recorded by the user, and save the routes planned by the user, unless the route is shared with Topo GPS.

      "label": "Die Zeit vergeht, und die Landschaften ändern sich, es ist sehr schwierig, auf einem riesigen Feld ein uraltes Geisterdorf zu finden. Das schafft erhebliche Hindernisse für Lokalhistoriker und Liebhaber der Antike. Vetus Maps löst dieses Problem! Jetzt alle notwendigen Alte-Karten der Landkreise und Provinzen in Ihrem Smartphone. Die Anwendung ermöglicht es Ihnen, die alte Karte auf die entsprechnede moderne Karte zu übertragen.\n\nAnwendungsmerkmale:\n\n- Übertragung auf eine moderne Karte (Satellit, Hybrid, Gelände)\n- Änderung der Transparenz der Karte\n- Kartenkatalog zum Herunterladen\n- Markierungen setzen\n- GPS-Tracks aufzeichnen\n- Suche nach Orten\n\nAuf den alten Karten ist eine große Anzahl verschiedener Objekte angegeben, die man als wertvolle Datenquelle für die Toponymie verwenden kann, da viele Namen verloren gegangen sind - sie sind auf keiner topographischen topografischen Karte zu finden. Selbst in unserer heutigen Zeit, viele Jahre später, kann man mit Hilfe dieser Karten recht sicher durch die Landschaft navigieren.\n\nAlte Karten sind immer offline verfügbar, für Satellitenkarten ist eine Internetverbindung erforderlich. Die Markerinstallation erfolgt durch langes Drücken auf die Karte\n\nPremium Abonnement:\nMit dem Jahresabonnement erhalten Sie Zugang zu allen Karten zum kostenlosen Download und können auch Karten von Drittanbietern oder Ihre eigenen Karten mit Dropbox herunterladen. Die Zahlung für den ersten Abonnementzeitraum wird Ihrem iTunes-Konto bei Bestätigung des Kaufs belastet. Der Preis ist regional unterschiedlich und beträgt nun 14,99 € pro Jahr.\n\nIhr Abonnement wird automatisch jedes Jahr bzw. jeden Monat zum gültigen Abonnementpreis verrechnet, und dieser Betrag wird 24 Stunden vor Ende des Jahres-/Monats-Abonnements von Ihrem Konto abgehoben. Um Ihr Abonnement zu verwalten oder die automatische Verlängerung zu beenden, gehen Sie einfach zu Ihren Kontoeinstellungen und inaktivieren Sie die automatische Erneuerung mindestens 24 Stunden vor dem Verlängerungsdatum. Nach Berechnung der Jahres-Abonnements können keine Rückzahlungen mehr erfolgen. Jeglicher unverbrauchte Anteil der Probezeit verfällt bei Kauf eines Abonnements. Für weitere Informationen, sehen Sie bitte die Benutzungsbedingungen (http://www.vetusmaps.com/termsofuse.pdf) und die Datenschutzerklärung ein (http://www.vetusmaps.com/privacypolicy.pdf).\n\nDie Aufnahme von GPS-Tracks läuft im Hintergrund. Die fortgesetzte Verwendung von GPS im Hintergrund kann die Akkulaufzeit Ihres Geräts erheblich verkürzen."

With the countdown timer, people who want to set up their home appliances to make the most of low-cost electricity can do so accordingly.\n\nAUTOMATIC ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING WHEN ELECTRICITY IS THE CHEAPEST AND CLEANEST\n\nGridio automatically charges your car when electricity is the cheapest, and usually the cleanest. After you plug in your vehicle, our algorithms will automatically charge up your vehicle’s battery by your desired time, when electricity is the cheapest. You can automatically avoid expensive peak-time hours, and by doing so help the grid as well as save on your energy bill, if you have dynamic tariffs. \n\nMAKE THE MOST OF YOUR SOLAR PANELS\n\nGridio maximizes your home solar use, by automatically charging your car when you produce enough solar and stopping the charging when the solar production drops. This allows you to maximize your self-consumption of solar and makes your EV an even greener member of our world. You can set your solar charge limits yourself, and soon we will also add automatic price optimization to it.\n\nNO HARDWARE REQUIRED\n\nEverything works through the app - you connect your vehicle securely to Gridio, set your charging needs and we will take care of the rest\n\n***\n\nIf you are using the Gridio app, please let us know what you think. How could we make your life easier? You can provide feedback through support@gridio.io.\nIf you have further questions, visit www.gridio.io and check out our FAQ section in the app and online.\n\nAlso, please like us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/gridio.io/"

Whether you ride the train, subway, bus, light rail, ferry or metro, use dockless scooters, bikes, ride-sharing like Uber or Lyft, getting the best urban mobility information is critical. Enter Moovit! Moovit provides riders with a one-stop-shop journey experience to help them get from point A to B in the easiest and most efficient way.

Plus, get real-time updates if/when there are changes to your favorite lines in case your bus time or train time is impacted!\n\n► Bike routes. Get bike routes in addition to the bus, subway, train, or metro trip plans. If you ride bikes (yours or shared) we can plan a route that includes the train or bus. Moovit will help you plan a trip that meets your transit-needs. Bike docking stations are updated in real-time. Bike trip plans are only available in supported metro areas.\n\n► Maps view.

On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Droneradar premium has been deprecated. All Premium features are now available in the Freemium version. !!!\n\nDroneradar is an official application enabling drone operators to find their way in the complicated maze of aviation regulations. The application is integrated with PansaUTM administered by the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency. The application is supported by the Polish Civil Aviation Office (ULC). \n\n!!! REMEMBER TO FOLLOW TIPS provided by Air Traffic Services!!!\n\n!!! Please be sure, you enable notifications !!!\n!!! Turn on location service on your phone during application installation !!!\n\nCongratulations on purchasing your new unmanned aircraft, often called drone, RPAS, UAV, or BSP.\n\nWith the first flight, you will join the group of airspace users. Despite its small size, your unmanned aerial vehicle is an aircraft with all its associated consequences.\n\nThe most important rules of unmanned aerial vehicle movement:\n\n- If you are flying a drone over 250gr. or any drone with a camera, register at drony.ulc.gov.pl or on the Webpage of your CAA (Civil Aviation Authority). Enter the received Drone Operator Registration number in the Droneradar application during flight Check-In.\n- Obey the rules. The iconographic images in the application illustrate what you can and what you cannot. Check their meaning out on the droneradar.eu\n- Minimize the risk associated with a possible failure of your drone\n- Be mind always \"in front of the drone\". Don't let the drone get ahead of your intentions\n- Never fly near airports (the lights in the application will tell you how close you are to the airport and whether you can fly your unmanned aerial vehicle);\n- Fly in sight;\n- Do not fly higher than 120 m. (Approx. 450 ft) AGL (Above Ground Level) in Open category. AGL stands for Over Terrain. 150 m. AGL is the minimum altitude for manned aircraft. They may not notice your drone;\n- Although it is not compulsory, buy liability insurance\n\nAre these rules enough to fly safely? Not always! You must be aware of existing air structures.\n\nUsing the Droneradar application, you can quickly and easily check if you can fly in a given place and time. Droneradar will inform you about other space users.\n\nHow does Droneradar work?\nRun the application, allow location services and observe the color of the lights at the top of the screen.\n\nGREEN - you can fly with attention to the height declared in the application.\nYELLOW - there are restrictions. You can check them by clicking the signaller icon at the top of the screen. There you will find a phone number for airspace managers.\nRED - no flights.\n\nCheck-In flight location registration\nTo inform other space users about your flights, click the Check-In. Enter your contact details and the type of drone you control. This information is voluntary, so it is worth it to be true. Confirm location. Your flying are will be marked on the Droneradar map for the indicated time.\n\nIf a flight plan is required at the selected location, log in to PansaUTM at https://utm.pansa.pl and follow the instructions.\n\nSafe and fun flights!\nDroneradar team\n\ndlapilota.pl / droneradar Sp. z o.o. the creator of the application and reserves the right to disable the service and / or update it at any time."

Moreover, you don’t have to pay beforehand.\n\nThese are the main advantages of using Telpark:\n- Pay safely in city council regulated areas without going to the parking meter and without using any paper.\n\n- Extend your parking time allowance without getting back to the car.\n- With one app, you can pay in the city council regulated areas and soon also at Empark car parks in Spain and Portugal.\n- Get notifications in your mobile when your parking time is about to expire.\n- Find your car thanks to the GPS position \n- Secure payments with credit card or Paypal\n- Manage all the vehicles from one single account\n- Without pre-payments\n- You can use it in more than 50 cities in Spain and 11 in Portugal\n- Cancel parking ticket fines directly from your mobile (in cities where local regulations allow it)"

Whether you're looking for DKV Mobility service stations or charging points in Europe or within your neighbourhood area, or whether you want to wash or park your vehicle, or even settle your refuelling bill with your smartphone: Our app is always there to guide you to the desired result in just a few steps.\n\nPaying after refuelling directly in your car?\n\nThe APP&GO feature guides you through the entire refuelling process: from selecting the nearest APP&GO station to authorising payment - the DKV Mobility App remains available to help you save valuable time in your daily routine.\n\nCharging your electric vehicle?\n\nThe new update of the DKV Mobility App not only gives you access to over 66,000 fuel stations, but to also more than 200,000 public charging points in our network. It's easy and is just one click away. Another unique feature is the intelligent route planning, where the DKV Mobility App automatically calculates the best route with optimal charging stops for long distances.\n\nNeed to find a station quickly?\n\nWith our new home screen, you have instant access to the station closest to you. You can check the price and start navigation right away.\n\nActively managing time windows in which the DKV CARD can be used?\n\nThe activation mode \"on demand\" offers the possibility to activate cards only for the period in which they are used for a transaction. During the rest of the time, the card is inactive, and transactions will be declined. Simply start the 60-minute time window during which fuel can be purchased. After the time has expired, the card is automatically deactivated again.\n\nWhat other benefits does the DKV Mobility App offer?\n\nIf you need immediate assistance, for example in the event of a breakdown or the loss of your card, the app offers direct dialing to connect you to the helpline.\n\nYou can find more information about our range of services at https://www.dkv-mobility.com/en/. \n\nDKV. You drive, we care."

      "label": "A high quality Speedometer app with the same sophisticated brain inside as our paid version. When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

Viewed maps will be stored on your device so that Topo GPS can also be used offline.\n\nWhy should you buy an expensive GPS device if you can install Topo GPS? Topo GPS contains all functions of a regular GPS device for less money, has a much more detailed map, and is more convenient to operate. The accuracy of the position determination is in favorable conditions about 5 m.\n\nIdeal for walking, hiking, cycling, mountain biking, sailing, horse-riding, geocaching, scouting, trail running and other outdoor activities. Also suited for outdoor professionals.\n\n- Map\n* To use Topo GPS you need to buy a map.\n* Official topographic maps of many countries, including Great Britain (OS Explorer), New Zealand and Australia are available as in-app purchase. \n* Topographic maps are very detailed maps, include height contours and are very suited for outdoor activities.\n* All maps of a certain region can be made offline accessible using the map download screen.\n* Easy switching between maps.\n\n- Routes\n* Recording routes, with pause and restart possibility.\n* Planning routes via route points.\n* Generating routes\n* Editing routes\n* Synchronization with your other devices via iCloud.\n* Searching routes with filters.\n* Routes can be organized into folders.\n\n- Waypoints\n* Easy adding by pressing long on map.\n* Adding waypoints through address or coordinates.\n* Sharing waypoints.\n* Editing waypoints.\n\n- Layers\nLayers contain information that can be added to and removed from the map.\n* Long distance bicycle routes\n* Mountainbike routes\n\n- Coordinates\n* Easy entering coordinates\n* Scanning coordinates\n* Supported coordinate systems:\nWGS84 decimal, WGS84 degree minutes (seconds), UTM, MGRS, and other country specific coordinate systems.\n* Coordinates grid layers\n\n- Intuitive interface\n* Clear menu with most important functions.\n* Different dashboard panels with distance, time, speed, altitude and coordinates.\n* Clear manual at www.topo-gps.com\n\n- Supported file formats:\n* gpx, kml/kmz, geojson (all also zip compressed), WFS, csv\n\n\nIf you are recording a route, the GPS will run in the background. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nRdzl, the company behind Topo GPS, does not obtain in any way the position of the user of Topo GPS. Rdzl does also not obtain the routes recorded by the user, and save the routes planned by the user, unless the route is shared with Topo GPS.

      "label": "Huntloc is a real-time hunting, tracking and management app for hunting teams and provides tracking devices for hunting dogs. You can see the movement of hunting dogs and other hunters on your smartphone, share information between hunters and create your own hunting map.\n\nTracking a common hunt is easy\nOne of the members of the hunt starts hunting on his or her phone and receives a unique code. Other hunters join the hunt using this code. This creates a hunting team whose movement is visible on the phone map. When the owner of a hunting dog with a Huntloc tracking device joins the hunt, all participants will also be able to see the dog's location. \nHunting with Huntloc is more effective, safer and more fun\n•\tWhile on a common hunt, your phone shows the current location of dogs and hunters, the direction of movement, the pace of movement, and the distance traveled. Hunting and dog tracking are unlimited in distance.\n•\tDuring the hunt, you can send messages to the participants and share the location of the various hunting events on the map (e.g., a caught game, an animal track, etc.). Plus, you can quickly call any hunter.\n•\tThe different maps of Google and the Estonian Land Board and the hunting objects recorded by the hunter themselves (e.g., animal feeding places and other hunting-related locations and areas) give an accurate overview of the hunting ground. You can share your hunting objects with other Huntloc users. \n•\tWhen navigating in the hunt, you can set a navigation target and then use the compass view to arrive at the desired location by the shortest route.\n•\tA 24-hour weather forecast with sunrise and sunset time will help you plan your hunt. You can view the weather forecast for your own location or for a location selected on the map.\n•\tHuntloc's portal.huntloc.com can be used for viewing the hunts you have participated in and for more convenient drawing of the hunting card.\n\nThe location of a dog with the Huntloc tracking device can be seen on your smartphone\nThe Huntloc tracking device provides a very accurate position of the dog in the terrain. The tracking device uses the mobile network and has no distance limitation - the dog can be tracked from thousands of kilometers away. All you need is a smartphone to monitor your dog and control your device. In addition to tracking, you can call the dog, listen to the dog's activities and give voice commands. Keeping the device constantly on the dog's neck, it acts as a security device and can be switched on from a distance when the dog is lost. \n\nThe tracking device is very strong, lightweight, waterproof and has a long service life. The monitoring time is 36 hours (10 seconds interval) and the standby time is 1 month. In order to ensure waterproofing, there are no openings or buttons on the unit, and the 3 indicator lights indicate the unit's operating status. The device is charged wirelessly."

With the countdown timer, people who want to set up their home appliances to make the most of low-cost electricity can do so accordingly.\n\nAUTOMATIC ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING WHEN ELECTRICITY IS THE CHEAPEST AND CLEANEST\n\nGridio automatically charges your car when electricity is the cheapest, and usually the cleanest. After you plug in your vehicle, our algorithms will automatically charge up your vehicle’s battery by your desired time, when electricity is the cheapest. You can automatically avoid expensive peak-time hours, and by doing so help the grid as well as save on your energy bill, if you have dynamic tariffs. \n\nMAKE THE MOST OF YOUR SOLAR PANELS\n\nGridio maximizes your home solar use, by automatically charging your car when you produce enough solar and stopping the charging when the solar production drops. This allows you to maximize your self-consumption of solar and makes your EV an even greener member of our world. You can set your solar charge limits yourself, and soon we will also add automatic price optimization to it.\n\nNO HARDWARE REQUIRED\n\nEverything works through the app - you connect your vehicle securely to Gridio, set your charging needs and we will take care of the rest\n\n***\n\nIf you are using the Gridio app, please let us know what you think. How could we make your life easier? You can provide feedback through support@gridio.io.\nIf you have further questions, visit www.gridio.io and check out our FAQ section in the app and online.\n\nAlso, please like us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/gridio.io/"

If traffic data is not available, statistical data is used instead.\n\n- Dynamic Points of Interest (POI) provide warnings of current road events.\nGeoNET users are warned, by voice and visually, about various current events along the route (police, danger area, speedcams, traffic accidents, bad roads, traffic jams, etc.)\n\n- Speedcams and speed radars.\n GeoNet provides advance warning of known stationary and portable speedcams.\n\n- Suggestion of new alternative routes during the trip\n\n- Smart voice search\n\n\nCAUTION:\nWhile driving, your first priority must be to follow driving regulations; use GeoNET instructions only when it is safe and legal to do so.\n\n\n- Garmin GPX waypoints import (Route: Waypoints)\n- PLT tracks import and export  (Route: Tracks)\n\n- Ask questions and make comments at the GeoNET forum: http://forum.probki.net\n\n* Long use of GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "Has it ever happened that you have to meet someone and the person can't explain where he/she is? This app will quickly find the location of another phone by sending a text message request. Most phones manufactured after 2010 can accept this request, no need to install any additional app on the 2nd person's phone. It does not get any easier than this!\n\nHow it is working:\n\n• User A wants to know a User B location.\n\n• User A enters the phone number of User B into the app.\n\n• The app generates a unique URL, and the URL is sent to User B.\n\n• If User B clicks on the link, user A will see the location of user B.\n\nLimitations:\n\n• This is not a spy app. User B must agree to share the location with you.\n\n• If User B has a device without GPS (desktop computer, tablet), the determined location may have a large accuracy margin (up to 5 km).\n\n• In rare situations, when user B is behind the corporate proxy, the app can show the proxy's location, not the user's.\n\nThe user location is determined in three ways:\n\n• E.123, E.164\n• RIR\n• W3C Geolocation API\n\nAuto-renewing subscription:\nTitle: Full Access 1m\nLength: 1 month\nPrice: $1,99 (check the price in the app)\n\nEULA:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.codeesteem.com/apps/phone-location/PrivacyPolicy.pdf"

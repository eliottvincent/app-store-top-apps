      "label": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nApple Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Tumblr. Pure effervescent enrichment. Old internet energy. Home of the Reblogs. All the art you never knew you needed. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up. \n\nOh, and influencers? Don’t even go here. Every video you find, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate, every waterfall GIF you secretly gaze at in wonder—that’s all you. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Welcome to weird. Make it yours. \n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is. \n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. Tumblr is the home of all things weird and wonderful, funny and fascinating—old-school internet vibes. We’re built a little different, just like everyone else who goes here.\n\nYour dashboard will become the place to see what you want to see: a chronological tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, reblog and add your own take, this is your universe to discover, express, and enjoy. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here.\n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world, F1 fanfic that your mutuals need to see—you have so many options. Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. You can make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. Don’t say we don’t spoil you!\n\nThe reblog starts conversations in which anyone can join. Reblogging creates jokes and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post only for a couple of your friends to engage with? All possible here). No matter who you are, where you are, or what you are (looking at you here, Pikaman), this is your space—with as much freedom or privacy as you need. \n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. Maybe you have a favorite blorbo from your show? There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3, *and* see their OC art on Tumblr, *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? You get the idea: it’s all here. Wait. Frogs. Did we mention the frogs? \n\nIt’s a whole world out here. If the prospect of reblogging, shipping, curating, and fanart feels a little daunting, or you simply require a refresher on how all this works, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart’s content. Or simply drift through the dream you’ve created for yourself—a chronological dashboard curated by you. For you. You hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service"

With personality insight, you are empowered to understand how it all works for yourself, make the right decisions, and set yourself up for success.\n\nWe were using all the dating apps. It was always the same result–going on dates with people we had no chemistry with. We were exhausted from all the wasted time and effort. We made Boo because we knew there was a better way.\n\nOur mission is to create a future in which personality enables our greatest potential, starting with our relationships.\n\nWe hope you like it,\nThe souls at Boo\n\nhttps://boo.world/terms-and-conditions"

      "label": "From strangers to buddies and more – build new friendships with HumansApp. Find humans who like the same things you do. Find humans who like you for you.\n\nChat with them, laugh with them, like each other more after each conversation. Or don’t – that could also be a part of the process! Go beyond your favourite colour. Talk about childhood dreams, insecurities, curiosities. Enough of dating apps. Find a friend to discuss your disaster dates, not to participate in them with you.\n\nHow is it different?\n\nHUMANS LIKE YOU\nNo endless swiping: all the humans you see already want to talk with a human like you. \n\nMAKING FRIENDS, NOT MATCHES\nDon’t wait for days for matches to appear. You don’t need to match first to send a message. Just go ahead and start a conversation.\n\nTOO SHY TO START TALKING?\nNot a problem. Add a thought provoking post and others will reach out to you.\n\nINFLUENCE WHO REACHES OUT TO YOU\nHave a preference for female friends? Mothers or Fathers? Child free couples? Humans in relationship? Anyone? Pick your preferences and the platform will do the rest.\n\nCONNECT ON SIMILAR TOPICS, NOT LOOKS\nJust like in real life, build friendships on the things you like, not how you look.\n\nNOT FOR DATING\nSafe space with AI flirting moderation and a full block of naughty images.\n\nABSOLUTELY FREE\nNo ads, no subscriptions, no payments.\n\nYour future friends are saying about the app:\n\n“Met some interesting, intelligent and awesome people” - Jay\n\n“found some really cool people I talk to daily, you get to know people without immediately stalking their social media profile but with actual conversations” - Gloria\n\n“I like being able to talk to people without the pressure of them saying inappropriate things to you, if they do, you can also report it, which makes me feel safe and comfortable” - meritxell\n\n“I absolutely love this app !! It's always interesting when someone new pops up and answers your questions!!! - Matthew\n\n“Unlike dating apps, people actually hold normal conversations on here based on real interests I’ve met quite a few nice people on here so it def does what it says on the tin” - Kate\n\n“I have to say that I was really surprised by this app. I was expecting the classic app where there are fake profiles, people just looking to flirt, have sex or things like that, but quite the opposite! It allows you to create direct mental connections with people with whom you share interests or ways of thinking. It's very good, I've been using it for a while and I've already made some real friends, the ones you keep talking about every day as time goes by. Congratulations to the creators, finally something real!” - Itsaso\n\n“Finally an app that facilitates genuine contact between people without passing by the usual sexual or material needs. So now the ultimate problem are the humans.” - Nicola\n\n“The best social app around here. Nothing else to say. This is the best socialising app and you won’t regret this. Just keep in mind: this is not Tinder. You can make hundreds of friends if you are really looking for them” - Ferdy23\n\nSometimes friendships don’t just happen. Try to build them with HumansApp."

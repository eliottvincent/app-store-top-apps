      "label": "The best and easiest way to capture and file your trainings.\nWith this app the cumbersome training documentation is a breeze. The App assists you with automatic data capture, different export formats and the possibility to visualize several trails on one map.\n\nThe Highlights of The Mantrailing App:\n\n◆ Visualize two tracks on one map:\nYou can visualize the track of the runner and the track of the mantrailing team on one map. With that you can optimize the training to your dog.\n\n◆ „VT\" - Virtual Trainer:\nYou can work on a trail without a third man as a backup. Just load the runner trail into the app, start the VT-Corridor and the app will warn you like an virtual Backup, when your dog is loosing the trail within the given corridor. Your training becomes more efficient and you can work in two if necessary.\n\n◆ Train with your friends and safe time while laying the trail:\nAs a runner you can record the track, export  and share it from the finish with the trailing team. Tracks can be shared and imported. Laying a long trail without the need for someone to go back all the way has never been easier.\n\n◆ Print the Trail Documentation:\nNo more handwritten and unreadable trail documentation and  maps. Just one click and you can print the trails, the maps and all the training data like weather conditions and comments in a well organized format. You can also export a nice printout to PDF, share it with friends or store it in your cloud.\n\n◆ Synchronization:\nCreate an account in the app. All your trails will be synchronized with this account among all devices.\n\n◆ Capture every tiny detail of your work:\nSometimes small details are important for your training. Therefore the app provides enough data fields to capture the names of the trail layer, the runner, the scent article, the surrounding, the ground and even all detailed weather conditions like rain, wind speed and direction etc …\n\n◆ Automatic Capture of Weather Data:\nCapturing weather data is now a breeze. The app downloads all relevant weather conditions like rainfall, temperature, cloudiness, wind speed and direction and many more with just a click. You ever wanted this? Here it is!\n\n◆ Everything at a glance:\nDuring trail recording, the app shows you all relevant trail data in one screen. You see the trail of the runner (can be turned off) and the trail of the dog on the same map. In addition you see the deviation between runner and dog trail, the length of the trail and the spent time.\n\nIn short: The Mantrailing App is a great tool for any mantrailer and trainer to optimize and increase the effectiveness of your training.\n\n\nContinuous use of GPS in the background can reduce the battery life considerable.\n\niTunes-Abo:\n• You can purchase the Pro-Version of this App via an annual auto-renewable Subscription for $7.99 per year.\n• Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account.\n• Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n• You can manage your subscriptions and switch off the auto-renewal by accessing your Account Settings after purchase.\n• Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, at $7.99.\n• You cannot cancel the current subscription during the active subscription period.\n\nGeneral Terms and Conditions: https://the-mantrailing-app.com/en/general-terms-and-conditions/\nPrivacy Policy: https://the-mantrailing-app.com/en/privacy-policy/"

From that moment I fell in love with the app!!! Awesome app, I recommend it to every sports fan!!!!!” \n\n • “Great app - Instead of having to go to multiple sites, I get a quick fix on my favorite teams with just this one.” \n\n • Awesome! - Best sports app there is! I love the team feature. I used to watch espn daily but now with this app I haven't watched in over two weeks. All the news is fast and to the minute. Bye-bye espn.\n\n • “Perfect - Get all your local teams big news in your notification center. How awesome!!!!!” \n\n • “Great App!! - This app is very useful for breaking news and interesting tidbits from my teams. Being separated from home sports city makes it tough to get a ton of info on just a couple teams I want to follow, better than twitter only sports related updates.”\n\n--\nFeedback?

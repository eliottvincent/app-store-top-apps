It has new graphics and a modern navigation: horizontal movements (swipe) allow users to switch from one of the 12 ski areas of Dolomiti Superski to the next in numerical order, while vertical movements (scroll) lead to various menu options, functions and services within the chosen ski area. If the GPS function of the device is activated, when the APP is launched, the system will lead to a contents page for the Dolomiti Superski ski area in which the user is located. One can login through the \"MyDolomiti\" community, after having registered (free of charge) to use the services. The APP offers useful information such as the open/closed status of individual lifts and slopes in real time, opening hours of the lifts, breaks, weather forecasts, points of interest such as ski schools, ski rentals, infopoints, Pick-up Box, as well as descriptions and contacts. \r\nThe user will also find other interesting and popular functions, such as the Performance Check, Tracking option to record the route taken while skiing, Routing which will navigate you to a predetermined point on the slopes. By reaching certain goals with the \"Tracking\" function, the user will be assigned interesting Badges - a great way to challenge yourself! And finally, you get to play too since the registered members of the APP-community can also have fun with the APP's game functions, creating their network of friends, who must also be registered members and in possession of a Dolomiti Superski ski pass and challenging each other throughout the ski season.\r\nDiscover the new APP’s full potential watching the video tutorials."

That’s why physical, coordination, and pace drills are an important part of your training. \n- Ball Control: a good relationship with the ball is essential for shooting, passing, and dribbling like a pro. From an amazing free kick, a dreamlike assist or juggling, our smart coaching tips will get you covered!\n\n\nNever underestimate the power of having fun while training: soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic are proof of how important is to practice soccer with passion while having fun.\n\n\nMake sure you start practicing your soccer skills and free kicks now!

      "label": "This app allows you to track every inch/centimeter of all your skiing adventures! \n\nOur app comes with a brand new independent application for watch devices. You can easily track your ski routes without using your phone and synchronize data afterwards to enjoy viewing your routes on a bigger screen!\n\nIt computes average speed, current speed, total time spent skiing, rest time and ascent times. The most accurate and comprehensive ski tracking app there is, with as much elevation and route information as possible. \n\nWe have developed a fresh new look for the history screen. It's more user friendly and intuitive than before and it’s now divided into two separate sections to display your data. The charts have now got a new screen which shows all the available configurations: speed over distance, speed over time, altitude over distance and altitude over time. The photos and segments displays are also more clean.\n\nThe coolest feature of this app is that it tracks your routes, no matter where you go. It registers and follows your route on demand, in real time, and then draws those routes onto a map which you can save and view later in a highly expanded history view, where you'll see graphs from your route, segmentation and map details as well as photos taken during a trip. Simply tap or move your finger over the chart to see when and where a given value occurred. \n\nYou can also choose from multiple snowbound activities, the app will function as a speedometer, calorie counter, keep track of checkpoint times, alert you with notification sounds at pre-set milestones, and even auto pause should you decide to stop somewhere for coffee or to take a photo. \n\nIf you do stop to take photos, they can easily be added with the data of your current position overplayed right on top. Your photos will have- elevation, average speed, location and even route info right on them. \n\nWith our custom maps, you’re able to download a portion of a map to use them even if you’re offline! Also, you can see most popular ski routes drawn over a map.\n\nOur app will also save all data associated with your account so that, should you choose to switch smartphones, nothing will be lost. Simply log in with the new device and pick up where you left off.\n\nNew maps based on Open Street Maps have been added to the application. You can now enjoy a fresh new look to your tracks, with certain ski resort routes being displayed on them. Moreover, we have implemented a feature which allows you to download a portion of a map for offline use, so that when you're on a trip with restricted access to WIFI, you can still enjoy the map display.\n\nWe have developed a brand-new independent application specifically for your watch device. Gain access to tracking your routes without a phone, just turn on our wearable application and enjoy our tracking data without worrying about your phone. Moreover, you get access to a new data set: your current heart rate! When you finish tracking, just press 'Save' button to automatically synchronize your track with your device.\n\nDark mode - get a new experience with our dark mode application! Turn on dark mode in your system settings and enjoy a new look of SkiPal.\n\nMore precise data tracking - improved functionality of your routes and ski data collection for more precise results.\n\nHealth app integration. On your watch track your health and workout data, observe your heart rate. Your data will be synchronized with system health kit on your watch device.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nhttps://skipal.us/privacy_policy.html\nhttps://skipal.us/terms.html"

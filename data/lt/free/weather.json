It shows the temperature of your current location. That does not mean that your phone becomes a thermometer and can read the temperature of the surrounding area, using a weather service. A lot of idiots download this app and complain that their phone can't read the temperature indoors. Of course it can't! It's a phone, and no matter what app or other software you install on it, it will never be able to read the temperature of its immediate surroundings unless you had some hardware already installed that can do so, and a touch-screen phone simply cannot take someone's temperature.\nby jefffafa123\n\n- Gets the temp for your current location, or for other saved locations. Works very well. I previously used another thermometer app, but it had banner ads that you couldn't close, and they covered the temperature if it dropped low enough. This one has a nice clean interface and easy to use!\nby AndyLPhoto\n\n- It is very accurate and is really easy to use and control. I recommend using this app!\nby AwesomeV01\n\n- Very nice. Very simple. I like the auto save feature and the ability to just flip through the pages to get where you want.\nby Tree on Hill"

      "label": "The app combines highly accurate weather forecast for your location with a 3D map showing development of weather in a broader area in a very interesting way. This allows you to see where precipitation is going to come from or where the wind is blowing from. The uniqueness of the app comes from the amount of data displayed. Forecast of weather, precipitation, wind, cloud cover, atmospheric pressure, snow cover and other meteorological data for different altitudes is available for the whole world. \n\nWIND ANIMATION\nThe Ventusky application solves weather displaying in an interesting way. Wind is displayed using streamlines which clearly portray the continuous development of weather. Airflow on Earth is always in motion and the streamlines depict this motion in an amazing way. This makes the interconnection of all atmospheric phenomena obvious.\n\nWEATHER FORECAST\nWeather forecast for the first three days is available in the app in one-hour steps. For other days, it’s available in three-hour steps. Users can also look up sunrise and sunrise times in a given place or air quality.\n\nWEATHER MODELS\nThanks to the Ventusky application, visitors get data directly from the numerical models that, just a few years ago, were used solely by meteorologists. The app collects data from the most accurate numerical models. Besides the well-known data from the American GFS and HRRR models, it also displays data from the Canadian GEM model and the German ICON model, which is unique thanks to its high resolution for the whole world. Two models, EURAD and USRAD, are based on current radar and satellite readings. These models are able to show precisely current precipitation in US and Europe.\n\nWEATHER FRONTS\nYou can also display weather fronts. We have created a neural network that predicts the positions of cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts based on data from weather models. This algorithm is unique, and we are the first on the world who makes global fronts forecast available to users.\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS\n• Temperature (16 levels)\n• Temperature anomaly\n• Perceived temperature\n• Precipitation (1 hour, 3 hour, long time accumulation)\n• Radar\n• Satellite\n• Wind gusts (1 hour, long time maximum)\n• Air quality (AQI, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3, dust or CO)\n• Probability of aurora\n\nLIST OF WEATHER LAYERS (PREMIUM)\n• Wind (16 levels)\n• Cloud cover (high, middle, low, total)\n• Snow cover (total, new)\n• Humidity (4 layers)\n• Dew point\n• Air pressure\n• CAPE, CIN, LI, Helicity (SRH)\n• Freezing level\n• Wave forecast\n• Ocean currents\n\nLIST OF WEATHER WIDGETS\n• Forecast 4x2\n• Forecast 2x2\n• Forecast 4x4\n• Radar 4x2\n• Radar 2x2\n\nThe app is completely free of ads.

Это реальные показатели реального устройства, а не домыслы спутников. А также можно вывести графики изменения температуры и давления за день, неделю, месяц и год.\nВ больших городах датчиков много, поэтому реальные показания практически всегда показываются правильно, т.к. датчик находится недалеко. Радиус сканирования датчика - 100 километров. \nВ удаленных местах, где датчиков мало, значения могут отличаться от реальных из-за дальности нахождения датчика.\nВ случае недоступности GPS данных, координаты вашего местонахождения будут получаться через сотовую связь. \nИндикатор типа получаемых данных находится в правом верхнем углу экрана. Также в нем показывается дальность нахождения датчика, с которого получена температура. \nВ случае отсутствия интернета, будет показано уведомление об этом.\nИмеется приложение для Apple Watch и виджет Today.\nВ версии 1.5 добавлена карта и и отображение ближайших датчиков на ней. Можно выбрать новое местоположение и приложение покажет ближайшие датчики к новому предполагаемому местоположению и посмотреть графики изменения температуры в выбранном месте.\nДобавлены кнопки манипулирования картой. Можно приближать, отдалять и позиционировать себя. Также поддерживаются манипуляции пальцами.\nВ версии 1.9.3 добавлены графики изменения давления и добавлены индикаторы тенденций изменения давления. Т.е. теперь приложение дает кратковременные прогнозы погоды в вашем местоположении."

You can select locations and make your own ground - station list. The Sun illuminates the globe as it updates in near real-time. The short term forecasts are up to +6 hours, while the long term forecasts are up to 3 days ahead in time. They are updated when the app is active and connected to internet.\n\nAn Aurora Compass is included that shows where the auroral oval [1,2], the Moon and the Sun are located as you look up at the sky from your location. The phase and age of the Moon is also visualized in the compass. By zooming out in the 3D view port, satellites, stars and planets appear in their orbits [3] around the Sun.\n\nFEATURES\n- 3D view port of Earth.\n- Solar illumination of the Earth and the Moon.\n- Aurora oval size and location in real time.\n- Day side location of the red Cusp. \n- Forecasts based on predicted Kp index estimated by the Space Weather Prediction Centre (NOAA-SWPC).\n- Includes a 2.4 million star map [4]. \n- City light texture [5].\n- Earth, Sun and Moon textures [6,7].\n- Sky view module to track planets and stars [8].\n- 3-day space weather condition forecast as news ticker.\n- Two-Line Element (TLE) satellite orbit calculations [9].\n- Skyview navigation.\n- 3D Laser Star pointer to identify star signs.\n- Sounding rocket trajectories.\n- Sun and Moon daily elevation plots with rise and set time.\n- Epoch selection for magnetic pole position [10]\n- Ovals based on polar orbiting satellites data [11]\n- Target web links added to satellites, stars, planets and position.\n- All-sky camera links to the Boreal Aurora Camera Constellation (BACC).\n- Sky color animation [12,13].\n- Zhang and Paxton ovals [14].\n- Youtube demonstration.\n\nReferences\n[1] Sigernes F., M.

Da bi se riješio problem vrlo kompleksne topografije Crne Gore i okruženja urađeno je dvostruko nestovanje (model u modelu) te je dobijen finalni matematičko-meteorološki model za simulaciju stanja atmosfere WRF-ARW, sa veoma finom horizontalnom i vertikalnom rezolucijom. U ovoj aplikaciji se pored toga koristi i tehnika machine-learning, upoređivanjem analitičkih i prognostičkih baza podataka čime se statističkim putem umanjuju nesavršenosti prognoze modela. Dodatno je obezbijeđen i operativni nadzor profesionalnih prognostičara, kako bi se izbjegle grube greške kojima su sklone automatizovane internet prognoze."

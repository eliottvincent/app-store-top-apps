      "label": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com"

      "label": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/support.html. If you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible."

And don't forget the mighty X-ray that will help to locate and mend a fractured bone!\n\nAfter successful treatment, little Doctors will receive an emotional reward from their patients in the form of smiles and applauds. \nIn addition to all of this, we believe that PEPI DOCTOR also serves as a playful reminder about hygiene and safe behavior.\n\nKey Features:\n• 3 cute characters\n• 5 conditions to cure\n• More than 20 different doctors’ tools\n• Amazing artwork, animations and sounds\n• Uses no spoken language, needs no translation\n• No win or lose situations\n• No in-app purchases \n• Recomended ages: 3 to 6."

      "label": "Мы поможем вам!\n\nВсего за несколько минут в день вы научитесь составлять предложения на английском, незаметно для себя выучите много новых слов.\n\nИнтенсивный обучающий курс «Полиглот» состоит из 16 занятий. После его завершения любой человек легко сможет разговаривать на английском языке.\n\nСписок занятий:\n\n1.   Базовая форма глагола.\n2.   Местоимения. Вопросительные слова.\n3.   Глагол \"to be\". Предлоги места. Like/Want.\n4.   Притяжательные местоимения.\n5.   Профессии. Этикет.\n6.   Степени сравнения прилагательных. Указательные местоимения.\n7.   Слова-параметры. Употребление much и many.\n8.   Предлоги и параметры времени.\n9.   There is / There are.\n10. Предлоги направления и движения.\n11. Модальные глаголы can, must, should.\n12. Continuous \n13.

Фразовые глаголы\n\nКаждое занятие содержит подробное описание грамматики английского языка по данному уроку.\n \nКак это работает?\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам простые выражения на русском языке.\n\nИз слов на экране вам нужно составить английский перевод.\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ. Правильный ответ озвучивается.\n\nЧтобы перейти к следующему уроку необходимо набрать 4.5 балла в предыдущем уроке. Пока баллы не набраны, уроки остаются заблокированными.\n\nРезультаты синхронизируются через iCloud.\n\nКак рассчитываются баллы?\n\nПрограмма помнит 100 последних ответов, количество ПРАВИЛЬНЫХ ответов делит на 100 и умножает на 5.\nЧтобы набрать 4.5 балла надо ответить правильно на 90 вопросов из 100.\n\nСлишком просто?\n\nТогда включите в настройках повышенный уровень сложности. Программа не будет предлагать вам варианты слов, а попросит ввести предложение с клавиатуры.\n\nЭКЗАМЕН\n\nЭкзамен предназначен для закрепления знаний по пройденным урокам. Также он хорошо подходит, чтобы освежить знания.\n\nПо каждому выбранному уроку составляется 10 заданий. Все задания перемешиваются и предлагаются Вам для выполнения в случайном порядке.\n\nПрограмма запоминает результаты выполнения по каждому из уроков в экзамене. По завершении экзамена выставляется общая оценка и оценка по каждому уроку.\n\nНе надо расстраиваться, если с первого раза Вы не получили максимальную оценку.\n\nЭто просто напоминание, что нужно дополнительно потренироваться в соответствующем уроке. Ведь главная цель данного приложения помочь Вам в изучении английского языка, а не выставление оценки за экзамен.\n\nЕсли вы знаете как улучшить программу, напишите нам !\n\nМы ВКонтакте: http://vk.com/polyglotmobile"

It’s the kind of thing you can imagine a science teacher using in the classroom of the future — except that we don’t have to wait.” - CNet\n \n“Zoom from Mercury to Pluto (which makes the cut in this app), passing each planet’s moons along the way. Because Solar Walk knows what time it is, the planets are in proper orientation to the Sun: Earth is dark where it is currently night and gradually lightens to daytime on the other side.” - NY Times\n\n\"It's great for showing my students the relative positions of the planets in the solar system, the satellites orbiting the Earth and our place in the galaxy. Awesome with a smartboard as well.\" - by jbrown61\n\nSolar Walk enables you to:\n\n► Observe 3D model of our Solar system with all its objects in real time and in a ​proper orientation. Turn into an astronomer and explore planets, moons, satellites, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, stars and other celestial bodies. Enjoy gorgeous graphics and visuals while navigating through the solar system!\n\n► Make virtual flights from one space object to another.\n\n► Travel in time and see what the universe and our Solar system looked like at a certain period.\n\n► Find an exciting view of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\n► Watch a collection of educational solar system movies to learn about space-related topics including Earth's moon phases, Earth's cycles, tidal phenomena, and zodiacal constellations.*\n\n► Enjoy 3D planetarium with the help of special glasses and activating the anaglyph mode.\n\n► Share interesting screenshots of the app with your friends.\n\n► Choose the view mode comfortable for you (orrery/true-to-scale).\n\n*Available through In-App Purchases.\n\nSolar Walk is a great educational tool appropriate for both adults and children. The amount of information users can learn about the planets, moons, satellites and other celestial bodies is impressive. Information is age appropriate, detailed and animated video clips make learning our solar system even more engaging!\n\nThe entire Solar system can be explored with Solar Walk app!"

      "label": "We received the \"Editor´s Choice\" award by Apple for \"Little Fox Animal Doctor\" And in addition our app was awarded the \"Tech with Kids' Best Pick Award\" for exceptional design of a children's app. \n\nLittle Fox has caught a cold. Can you help to find him a cure? The bat has broken its wing. Do you know what to do? \n\nWhether a bump on the head, a stomach ache from too much candy, a little wound, or a sunburn, these funny animals need the help of a really good doctor! \n\nFrom Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger, the illustrator and director behind the bestseller Apps „Nighty Night“, „Little Fox Music Box“ and „Nighty Night Circus“ comes a wonderful new 3D-App which your child will love! \n\nThe app is full of humorous animations, amazing 3D illustrations, and funny short movies. In the animal doctor’s office, located in a magical treehouse, the animals are waiting to be cured. Kids are playfully guided through applying treatments that they might have experienced themselves: measuring temperatures, taking medicine, getting a plaster. And of course, eating a snail is probably just good for owls!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nHighlights:  \n\n1.There are 7 animals in the App - fox, bat, rabbit, mole, hedgehog, spider and owl, with 21 different injuries, sicknesses, and diseases.                                                                                                      \n2. Your child has many different treatments and medicines to choose from to cure the animals and make them happy again. \n3. Every time your child plays the App the animals have different illnesses, injuries and diseases.                                                                                             \n4. Little Fox Animal Doctor is the first 3D-App by Oscar-nominated artist Heidi Wittlinger. She is also the creative genius behind Nighty Night, Little Fox Music Box and Nighty Night Circus. Her Apps have been downloaded over 5 million times worldwide.                                                                                                                                  \n\nThe App will make your children’s dreams of being an Animal Doctor come true!\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids."

Отображается в правом верхнем углу. Означает количество баллов по текущему слову.\n• Процент изученности. Означает процент изученности слов в словаре.\n\nКАК НАЧИСЛЯЮТСЯ БАЛЛЫ\n\nЗа правильный ответ начисляется 1 балл, за неправильный - снимается 2 балла, при просмотре карточки балл не засчитывается.\n\nПервые три балла начисляются при изучении слова, их можно набрать сразу. После этого слово переходит на повтор и баллы по нему не начисляются пока не настанет время повтора.\n\nЧетвертый балл дается при повторе через 1 день.\nПятый балл дается при повторе  ещё через 3 дня.\n\nИтого, слово может стать выученным на пятый день, если вы набрали 5 баллов.\n\nКАК ЭТО РАБОТАЕТ.\n\nПрограмма предлагает вам на русском языке слово и предложение с этим словом. Вам необходимо ответить, как данное слово в текущем контексте должно быть переведено на английский язык.\n\nЕсли вы ответили правильно, программа похвалит вас. Если вдруг ошиблись - подскажет правильный ответ и покажет карточку слова.\nВ любом случае вам будет показан английский вариант предложения.\n\nРазные формы слов учатся и учитываются в статистике независимо. Например, по словам I и me, see и saw подсчёт ведётся отдельно.\n\nКарточку слова можно посмотреть выбрав соответствующий пункт меню.\nПроцесс изучения слов начинается с того, что программа набирает из своего словаря 15 слов и начинает их показывать в случайном порядке.\n\nПосле того, как слово переходит в группу \"повторяемые\" из словаря извлекается следующее слово.\n\nПовтор производится через 1, 2 дня. Время, когда будет показан повтор всегда исчисляется от времени предыдущего ответа.\n\nЕсли вы отвечаете правильно на все повторы, то слово переходит в группу \"выученные\" и больше не будет предлагаться.\nЕсли вы посмотрели карточку, то баллы не начисляются.\n\nСЛОВАРЬ\nНа текущий момент словарь программы содержит около 1500 наиболее употребляемых английских слов, а также слов используемых в программе \"Полиглот\".\nНеправильные глаголы представлены в первой и второй формах. Подсчет баллов по каждой форме идет независимо. Слова в словаре расположены в порядке изучения.\n\nОЗВУЧКА\nДоступно произношение английского предложения."

      "label": "Work and play the farmer's way! Milk your cow, gather eggs from your hens and raise your crops. Have a picnic, play the fiddle and hit the hay! From sunup to sundown, Toca Life: Farm is fun on the farm!\n\nEXPLORE LIFE ON THE FARM\nThe four locations in Toca Life: Farm will give you everything you need to tell your farm stories. Tend to the animals in the barn — feed them and clean up their poop! Once you've taken care of the animals, head to the house, where you can have a meal then grab your banjo for an impromptu jam session. After a good night's sleep head out to the field to tend to your crops. Harvest your produce and head to the store, where you can sell your food, make new products and buy goods!\n\nTURN YOUR HARVEST INTO FOOD\nPlant your seeds and find out how to make them grow! Tinker with your tractor to see what it can do! The food machine magically turns your raw ingredients into food: Use milk to make cheese, then use the cheese and corn to make cheese puffs! Use berries to make jam, wheat to make bread, and then use those ingredients to make donuts! Discover all the foods you can make and how you can make them!\n\nCREATE AN ORIGINAL VIDEO OF YOUR STORY\nUse the in-app recording feature to create an original video! This feature records your voice as you’re telling the story, along with your characters’ movements. Create farm videos up two minutes long and save them to your camera roll to share later!\n\nFEATURES:\n- Explore four locations: barn, house, field and store.\n- Create stories for 29 new characters plus all the animals!\n- Feed the animals, milk the cow and gather eggs from your hens.\n- Bottle the milk from the milk tank.\n- Help the vet check the animals.\n- Let the pigs (or people!) wallow in the mud.\n- Clean up different types of animal poop!\n- Grab the banjo, fiddle, guitar or washbucket bass and jam into the night!\n- Pick fruit in your orchard.\n- Farm your crops from planting to harvest.\n- Use your tractor's different functions to farm faster!.\n- Fire up the food machine to turn your harvest into food.\n- Record your stories in the app and share with your friends!\n- No time limit or high scores — play for as long as you like!\n- No third-party advertising\n\nWE LISTEN\nSo many of you asked for a farm in the Toca Life series, and we're excited to give you what you want!

Find the hidden Numberblocks, add them together and see what happens. \n\n● Every time you get to Ten, you win something new to play with.\n\n► Play hide and seek! Tap on the Numberblocks when they poke their heads out.\n\n► When you have found two Numberblocks, drag one on top of the other to start the number magic. \n\n► Predict what will happen when you add them together - if you don’t know, take a guess.\n\n► Make the number magic happen yourself: drag both Numberblocks into the white shape. Watch the number magic happen.      \n                  \n► Keep finding more Numberblocks and adding them on until you make a Ten.               \n\n► An animation plays to celebrate every time you make Ten.         \n\n► You will also discover a new interactive plaything in the park. Try playing with it!\n\nAs you keep playing, the sums get gradually harder and the Numberblocks try out new number shapes. This helps children get better at recognising amounts on sight. If a Numberblock looks unfamiliar, try counting their blocks!\n\nKeep going to fill the park with playthings. After discovering all 20, you can restart the game and play again. Repeat play is a great way to get better at your number bonds and predicting which Numberblocks you will make."

It is a world that we cannot see but that is literally all around us.\nThe Architecture of Radio is a 360 degree data visualization of what this world might look like. It shows the cell towers, GPS satellites and Wi-Fi routers around you that allow us to live our digital lives.\n\nNew: support for Iphone X, XR, XS and XS Max Screens\nNew: Cardboard support!\nImmerse yourself in the Infosphere in Virtual Reality using a cardboard or compatible headset*\n\n*Carboard support only for iPhone. iPhone 6s or newer recommended for best performance.\n\nWhy should I use this app?\n\nOut of curiosity! We are increasingly dependent on a global ecosystem of digital signals. We use them for so many things, yet we cannot see them. We can see the roads we use to travel, the buildings we live in, but not the infrastructure that is changing the world. How can we understand this world without understanding how it works? \nThe purpose of this app is to make the invisible visible so we can look at it, think about it and discuss it.\n\nWhy Should I not use this app?\n\nThis app is not a measurement tool. It’s purpose is to inspire, to see the world through a different lens. The app is based on real world data and gives you a pretty good idea of the density of digital signals around you, but it won’t tell you where to move the couch to get a better WIFI signal.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360 degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers and hundreds of satellites.\n\nIs this really what radio signals look like?\n\nWe can’t see radio with our eyes. The waves that we use for our cell phones and Wi-Fi are way outside the spectrum of visible light. In order to “see” radio, it has to be interpreted or translated into an image that we can see. There are many ways to do that but it will always be an interpretation.\n\nThe Architecture of Radio is an impression of the infosphere, a way of seeing it."

And at three bucks, it’s a steal\", Cult of Mac.\n\nApple App Store Staff Favorite\n\nVoted Best Educational iPhone Application by AppAdvice\n\n\n---\n\nPocket Universe\n\nHave you ever looked up at the night sky, and wondered what exactly you were looking at? Pocket Universe is an easy-to-use app that will help you learn the names of constellations, bright stars, planets and more.

Drive the street sweeper and unload the truck crane!\n\nOn our construction site your child can drive a digger, mix cement, roof a building, operate a crane, drive a street sweeper or paint a house. There’s so much to do here. Our Little Builders dig, plaster, fill, paint and mix... And they need your children´s help.\n\nAt the same time they can watch funny things happen, because on every building site there’s always something going wrong.

Depending on the child’s age, all animations and functions can run automatically or be controlled through a tap.\n\n7 interactive scenarios contain over 100 interactive animations and surprises:\n\n1. Steer the digger, fill the truck and repair the water pipe.\n2. Paint the house in different colours and unload the removals truck.\n3. Operate the crane and build a new roof for the house.\n4. Mix cement and build a real wall.\n5. Operate a big cement mixer and concrete a large area.\n6. Drive the street sweeper and clean the dirty road.\n7. Unload the crane truck and make sure it leaves on time.\n\nAmazing graphics, great animations, a user-friendly interface, no text and no in-app purchases. Download now and start building!\n\nPlease also check out our other great Apps for kids:\n\n„PETTING ZOO“ - is a fantastic storybook app for the iPad and iPhone.

In the AR Talking Cards app we have taken flash cards and interactive learning closer to reality, by introducing Augmented reality that makes images and content on the flash cards pop right in front of your screens.\n\nAll you need to do is to\n•\tDownload and print pre-coded image sheets from our website https://www.artalkingcards.com \n•\tCut them with scissors so that they look like normal flash cards. \n•\tOpen the AR Talking Card app on your phones or tablets (after installation)\n•\tJust hover the device over any one of your chosen flash cards\n•\tAnd witness your flash cards come to life\n\nWhat AR Talking Cards app does is that it uses special programming to scan and read the images present on the cards and brings a life like 3d shape of the same image in front of you by using augmented reality.\n\nWith over 4 categories of object sheets to download and scan from, AR Talking Cards introduces a new way of interactive learning.  \n\nYou can download all 4 AR Sheets of our Interactive AR Talking Cards 4D app. Each pdf book includes different Augmented Reality pages, with beautiful images.\n\nFrom Animals to Vehicles, Alphabets to Numbers, kids have everything they need to play and see the cards pop out these images with sounds. AR talking Cards App is fully compatible with smartphones and tablets.\n\nFeatures:\n\n•\tBeautifully 3D rendered Animals, Vehicles, Alphabets and Numbers to help your toddler or preschooler learn the object with its sound and name.\n•\tInteractive 3D rendered images that let you capture every angle of the object/animal or shape.\n•\tThe images are complete with sounds of animals, numbers, and letters based on what card you scan\n•\tYou can also hear the sounds again and also pronunciation in case you are practicing letters.\n•\tAnd also screenshot the images of 3d rendered objects which will look like amazing optical illusions.\n\nNote:\n\nDownload the card sheets only from our website https://www.artalkingcards.com, and we suggest you print and cut them into flash cards. The printouts can either be color or black or white, both will showcase same results. \n\nPlease share your suggestions & feedback on feedback@artalkingcards.com\n\nGoogle+ : https://plus.google.com/u/0/107302410009075383713\n\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/articulationessentials\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/articulationess\n\nOR via Reviews Below"

The world of science just got a little bit weirder and a lot more fun with Toca Lab: Plants!\n\nJust like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way. Choose your plant, then visit five different locations in the lab:\n\n● Grow light: Shine the light on your plant and watch what happens! Does your plant bask and happily sigh in the light, or groan and wriggle away? What happens when you turn the light up a notch or two?\n\n● Watering tank: Put your plant in the tank and fill it up with water. Will your plant float? How does your plant behave when it’s soaking wet?\n\n● Nutrition station: What’s the optimal diet for your plant? Try the three different nutrition formulas and discover which ones your plant character likes!\n\n● Cloning machine: Spin the wheel on the cloning machine and before you know it, you’ll have five little versions of your plant. Wonder what the clones can do? Experiment and find out!\n\n● Crossbreeding apparatus: Here you can mix two plants to create something unexpected. Try it and see what happens!\n\nHave fun experimenting at each station to see how the plants evolve. Keep experimenting until you’ve collected all 35 plant characters in the app. Once you’ve collected a plant, keep experimenting to continue to evolve it! Who says kids can’t be scientists? Toca Lab: Plants brings out the budding botanist in everybody!\n\nFEATURES\n- Start with one plant and experiment your way to 35 different plant characters, each with its own unique personality!\n- Continue to evolve existing plants through experimentation!\n- Evolve plants with five lab tools: grow light, watering tank, nutrition station, cloning machine and the crossbreeding apparatus.\n- Discover plants from five groups: green algae, mosses, ferns, trees and flowering plants.\n- Learn the names and Latin names of real-life plants!\n\n--\n\nABOUT TOCA BOCA\nAt Toca Boca, we believe in the power of play to spark kids’ imaginations and help them learn about the world.

Then you’ll love Busy Shapes designed for children from 2 years old!\n\n*** Featured in App Store Best of 2014 ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n*** Featured in the USA Today ***\n*** Recommended by The Good App Guide ***\n*** Common Sense Media Editors' Pick 2014 ***\n*** Parents‘ Choice Awards 2014 ***\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2014 ***\n\n> Inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980)\n> Helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of engaging puzzles\n> Real-time dashboard to monitor progress\n> Includes an array of kid-friendly features, such as “passing” swipe control & more!\n\nABOUT BUSY SHAPES\nBusy Shapes helps children improve their ability to handle simple objects through a series of puzzles, in which they must change simple shapes and place them in proper holes. Along the way, the app responds to each child’s actions with positive guidance and motivation. Plus, the app’s digital exploratory playground regularly refreshes with different objects, which keeps children interested and engaged.\n\nINSPIRED BY JEAN PIAGET\nBusy Shapes is inspired by the pioneering works of famed Swiss scientist and intelligence expert Jean Piaget (1896-1980), who believed that “children are little scientists”, and that a child's thoughts are built through experiences that encourage him or her to engage in the reasoning process.\n\nINNOVATIVE, SCALEABLE PLATFORM\nBusy Shapes’ innovative scaleable platform for evolving experimentation lets children take advantage of the time they spend on touch screens -- so they aren’t just having fun, but learning every second of the way.\n\nKID-FRIENDLY DESIGN\nBusy Shapes features a special “kid-friendly” design that compensates for the fact that when young children hold an iPad or iPhone, they often have a finger touching the screen.\n\n“PASSING” SWIPE CONTROL\nBusy Shapes features “passing” swipe control that is essential for young children's quick hands (i.e. even if a child's finger reaches an object after he or she was already touching the screen, the object is still grasped as intended).\n\nPOWERFUL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)\nBusy Shapes’ powerful AI supports each child’s unique learning journey. For example, the AI tracks the time it takes each child to complete a level, and increases or decreases difficulty accordingly.\n\nGUIDED ACCESS\nTo prevent children from exiting the app by pressing the “home” button, Busy Shapes features a customizable Guided Access. This feature also disables selected parts of the screen for safety and protection.\n\nSEAMLESS INTERACTION\nBusy Shapes’ seamless interactive game area never blocks or limits children, and lets them freely access shapes. The menu is also neatly hidden away.\n\nAUTOMATIC MEMORY\nSometimes the best learning is a combination of cognitive exercise and physical play. Busy Shapes’ automatic memory saves a child’s place in any particular game, which makes the app an ideal complement to physical play and for shorter games.\n\nMULTIPLE LANGUAGE SUPPORT\nThe app is now available in: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Greek, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support request, please write at support@edokiacademy.com or visit the Edoki Academy Online Community at edokiacademy.com."

Will you pass the test at your next pilot screening ? With this app you can test it and decide, wether you have to study and increase your skills in one or another area.\n\nAs pilot you have to have a good understanding of physics and technology and you will have to demonstrate these at the pilot screening to get into a cockpit in the first place....\n\nLuckily, everyone can improve these skills, and this app is the best tool for testing and training. And you can do this wherever you are, using your iPhone or iPad.\n\nThe app is completely easy and intuitive to use. It has 5 sections where questions of different subjects are presented and so you can test your knowledge.. Each test comprises 20 questions. The result is computed and shown after the test is completed. The highscore and the result of the last try is shown on the menu screen, so the app works a bit like a game...yes, studying and learning can also be fun...\n\nThe test subjects:\n\n- Mechanics\n- Electromagnetism\n- Optics\n- Waves\n- Thermodynamics\n\nAll of these test subjects are part of most pilot screenings one way or another. So the more you train these skills with this app, the higher the chances are, that you end up in the cockpit of your dreams. And if you are already in the cockpit of your dreams, you should train anyway...knowledge never hurts...\n\nEven if you are not a pilot, it makes sense to train your physics and technological comprehension skills with this app. It is fun, and having a good understanding how the world works, can help you in many professions and in many areas of life.\n\nThis app will be constantly improved in future. I add new questions at regular updates and I am working on n extension which will also teach you how the questions can be answered.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact me via email: thomas.oswald@aeroware.at or check my youtube channel for tutorial videos regarding this and other apps. Also check my other pilot apps in the App Store."

В этом ему помогут яркие анимированные иллюстрации и озвученное диктором стихотворение. Рисунки «оживают» при нажатии на них. \n\nВторой блок состоит из упражнений на закрепление полученных знаний. Например, малыш открывает пару из буквы и изображения, начинающегося на эту букву. В следующих заданиях представлены картинки и буквы, из которых надо подумать и найти верную. Также есть задания на составление слов из изученных букв.\n\nВ третий блок добавлены умные раскраски со знакомыми персонажами. Каждую картинку нужно раскрашивать, используя буквы русского алфавита. У ребенка развивается наглядно-образное мышление, внимание, тонкая моторика.\n\nВсе уровни озвучены диктором, а задания проходят в форме интересной игры.\n\nМы любим детей, поэтому сами пишем добрые стихи и рисуем смешные картинки. \nУ нас самый профессиональный диктор! \nМы благодарны Вам за выбор нашей игры! \n\nСпасибо за добрые отзывы!\n\nЕсли вдруг у Вас появились замечания, то напишите нам на почту support@catdonut.com, и мы обязательно Вам ответим!\n\nИгра на русском языке. \n\nМы открыты для всех Ваших пожеланий!

Crazy Gears is a new-aged digital puzzle game, designed with a real mechanical engine and with children's critical thinking skills in mind! Hours of fun guaranteed for everyone who is up for the challenge, yes, even you Mom & Dad!\n\n*** Children's Technology Review Awards 2015 ***\n*** Parent's Choice Gold Winner Fall 2015***\n*** App of the week by Fun2Tap ***\n*** Best of the Best by Best Apps For Kids ***\n*** Featured worldwide by App Store as a Best New App ***\n\n\nABOUT CRAZY GEARS\nExplore a captivating digital playground in this tantalizing puzzle game! Children manipulate gears, chains, rods, and pulleys, to pull themselves through each level, which teaches them how different mechanisms affect one another when constructing a machine. Each reasoning challenge was carefully designed to adhere to the theories of educational technology pioneer, mathematician, computer scientist, and designer of the first programming language for children, Seymour Papert.\n\n“The best use of games is to leverage their tendency to enhance learning”- Papert\nRecommended Ages 5-9 \n\nAs a child, Papert fell in love with gears. Their movement fascinated him in every way and inspired his career. Crazy Gears was conceived not only as a tribute to him, but with the hope of providing a child with the inspiration to discover and understand the physical properties of mechanisms found in their everyday lives. Such complex notions include tension, motion, and gravity. We achieve this by encouraging the child to manipulate the objects in each level to determine how they work together to accomplish a goal.  Interactions with technology give kids the power to construct their understanding of STEM/STEAM subjects in meaningful ways. Here we engage them in play that does just that!\n\n\nFEATURES\n• No rules\n• No explicit instructions \n• Kid-Friendly​ Design\n• Powerful Artificial Intelligence\n• Seamless Interaction\n• Multiple Language Support\n• Crash Resistant Design\n• Bold, bright colors\n• Automatic Memory\n• Special mode for children with CVI\n\nSTEM/STEAM TOPICS EXPLORED\n• Gears \n• Mechanical Systems (simple and complex) \n• Action and Reaction \n• Motion (circular, rotary, and reciprocating) \n• Ratios\n• Tension\n• Torque and Speed\n• Mechanical Advantage \n\nABOUT US\nEdoki Academy’s mission is to provide children with enjoyable early-learning activities using the latest technologies. Our team members, many of whom are young parents or teachers, strive to produce tools that motivate and inspire children to learn, play, and progress. \n\nPRIVACY\nWe take your child’s privacy very seriously, for this reason, we are proud to offer a product that is certified COPPA compliant by PRIVO. \n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nIf you have any support requests, comments, or questions do not hesitate to contact us at support@edokiacademy.com.

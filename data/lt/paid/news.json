A sharing extension allows you to add links from outside of Reeder.\n\n\nBIONIC READING\nA higher dimension of reading. With Bionic Reading you read texts with more focus, awareness, and sustainability. Read more about Bionic Reading at bionic-reading.com.\n\n\nWIDGETS\nView most recent articles, configurable to only show items from feeds, folders, searches (for services that support searches) or tags (for read later services).\n\n\nMARK AS READ ON SCROLL\nWith version 5, Reeder finally supports marking items as read while scrolling. Off by default, this can be enabled on a per-account basis.\n\n\nREADER VIEW\nEnter Reader View (for feed items and read later links that support this) for a clutter-free reading experience directly in Reeder's article viewer. You can enable \"Automatic Reader View\" on a per-feed basis to always load items of a feed with Reader View.\n\n\nSUPPORTED THIRD-PARTY SERVICES\nFeedbin, Feedly, Feed Wrangler, FeedHQ, NewsBlur, The Old Reader, Inoreader, BazQux Reader, FreshRSS, Instapaper and Pocket."

Swipe from edges to navigate in history. Click page links or tap the page number field at the top to enter page number manually. All sub pages are displayed below first page. Supports landscape mode. \n\nShortcuts: \nFive configurable shortcut buttons for channel and page. Reconfigure by holding on the button for 3 seconds. \n\nMiscellaneous: \nSome channels have a time at the top that is not the same as when viewed on a TV. This time reflects the time the page was changed. So you may think you read old news but it is the latest available on internet and the same as on TV. \n\nPlease note: \nThis is only a specialized web browser and relies on publications on the internet. This means that channels may disappear at any time."

Click page links or tap the page number field at the top to enter page number manually. All sub pages displayed below first page. Use system settings to change start page and other preferences. Supports landscape mode.\n\nShortcuts:\nFive configurable shortcut buttons for channel and page. Reconfigure by holding on the button for 3 seconds.\nYou can swipe the page number at the top to go to a predefined page. Use settings on your home screen to configure. Default all swipes go to page 100.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nSome channels have a time at the top that is not the same as when viewed on a TV. This time reflects the time the page was changed. So you may think you read old news but it is the latest available on internet and the same as on TV.\n\nPlease note:\nThis is only a specialized web browser and relies on publications on the internet.

However, some sites set up their feeds to only show a portion of each entry, you know, to get you to click through to their actual website. We find that really annoying, and we're sure you do too.\n\nWhich is why, unlike other RSS feed readers, that either push you into a browser (in-app or otherwise), or depend on third party text parsing services and require you to be online to fetch the full text of one article at a time (which makes it no different from having to click/tap through to a website), in lire, you get your favorite RSS feeds as they should've been. You don't need to click through to any website (though, you do still have the option to, if you really wanted). It takes your favorite partial feeds, does its magic, and converts them in to full feeds, so you don't have to click/tap on those annoying 'Read more' or 'Continue reading' links.\n\nOnce they're cached, you don't even need to be connected to read your full-text feeds.\n\nUse as a standalone feed reader, sync with iCloud,\n\nor,\n\nsync with any of the several services: Feedly, Feedbin, FeedHQ, The Old Reader, Inoreader, BazQux Reader, Newsblur, Feed Wrangler, FreshRSS, Miniflux, Nextcloud News, Tiny Tiny RSS."

The App lets you subscribe and organize your news feeds, which will be updated fully automatically, so you always have the latest news available within the App. All articles will presented for a comfortable reading experience, but of course the original web view is also available.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nLegi is special among RSS readers, because it has a speech output feature. This means the App can read all articles aloud when you can not read these yourself, for example when driving a car, while doing sports and for many other activities where you can't look on your device. The App has a full-featured audio player for the speech output (Play/Pause, skip back/forward, a timeline etc.) which works similar to the one of a music player App. Of course, all remote controls for music (the one from the control center, headphones, or Apple Watch) will work for Legi as well, so Legi can be in the background as well.\n\nThe full text of all articles will be presented in a comfortable reading mode, for which you can configure colors, fonts, text size etc. to match your own preferences. \n\nAn offline mode makes it possible to read all articles even if no internet connection is available. In addition the App lets you configure when and under which conditions the data is loaded, so you can load most or all of the data using WiFi and less or no data in mobile networks to avoid traffic.\n\nYou can also create \"smart playlists\" to categorize and organize articles independently of the feeds.\n\nSeveral 3rd-party services to manage your feeds are supported as well: \n- FeedWrangler\n- Feed HQ, FeedBlur\n- FeedBin\n- BazQux\n- InoReader\n- The Old Reader\n\nAlso feeds can be saved as favorites, you can export or import your feeds via OPML, you can share articles using the ShareSheet and much more.\n\nThe Watch App lets you read or listen to (via speech output) articles on your Apple Watch as well. This is great for all the occasions where you do not have your iPhone with you, for example for all kinds of sports activities"

Also remember that fire and weather can change quickly.\n\nAll data is provided Copyright from the NSW Rural Fire Service.\n\nFollow P4G on twitter at P4G_Apps"

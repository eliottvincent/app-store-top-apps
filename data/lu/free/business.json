      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

Whova exceeds other business card reader apps like CamCard, CardMunch, ScanBizCards or Scannable etc. by automatically building full profiles using Whova's SmartProfile technology. This allows you to gain deep insights into your contacts' professional backgrounds, work experience, passions, and interests. You can also seamlessly connect with contacts online via LinkedIn and other platforms.

We no longer have to wander around wondering if we will bump into the person we really would like to meet. “\n\n- “I could see who attended and easily follow up with the people after this entrepreneur/investor event”\n\n- “I have seen other event apps but neither of them provided such valuable information of the attendees. “\n\n- “This app has been fantastic for networking, announcements, agenda, etc., at this one-week conference!”\n\n- “Another great feature of the Whova app is the ability to share slides and documents electronically.”\n\n- \"Whova is an amazing app for keeping track of your connections and storing them in one easy-to-access place. I love the ability to connect with contacts via LinkedIn and the simplicity of emailing potential members.\"\n\nGet in touch:\n\nTo partner with Whova or simply to stay up-to-date with the latest news, please visit our website and follow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/whovasupport\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback!\nContact us at: support@whova.com\n\nAcknowledgements: Icons by Icons8"

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

      "label": "The refreshingly simple, and remarkably effective, project management platform.\n\nManaging people and projects under pressure is tough enough. Unfortunately, lots of software makes it worse by over-complicating things. Basecamp’s different.\n\nWhat makes Basecamp special?\n\nIt’s dialed in. For nearly two decades, we’ve continually refined a unique set of tools and methods to fundamentally reduce complexity, and make project management more of a joy and less of a chore. Perfected and pressure-tested by hundreds of thousands of teams on millions of projects, Basecamp’s the gold standard for a simpler, superior version of project management.\n\nBasecamp works because it’s the easiest place for everyone in every role to put the stuff, work on the stuff, discuss the stuff, decide on the stuff, and deliver the stuff that makes up every project. Not on separate platforms scattered in various places, but all intuitively organized in one centralized place where everyone can work together.\n\nBasecamp’s intentionally simple by design. It’s why teams that sometimes leave in search of “more power” end up slamming into the consequences of over-powered software: Complexity. Complexity doesn’t work. Basecamp does. It’s why those that leave end up coming back and sticking with us the second time around. You never know what you had until it’s gone."

      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password).

You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

The application has a feature that allows the sending notifications before the various collections. You will be reminded when specific pickups of your choice will take place. You can also schedule various pickups using the app directly through placement of a call or request via the app. Through this app, SICA can also inform you about any news that are relevant to you. \nWe are still at your disposal for any suggestion.\n\nGerman:\nDiese Applikation wurde entworfen um die Kommunikation zwischen den Bürgern der Mitgliedsgemeinden und dem Sica zu vereinfachen. Um die Bedienung bestmöglich zu gewährleisten, können Sie zwischen 3 Sprachen wählen; Französisch, Deutsch und Englisch.\nNachfolgend finden Sie den Umweltkalender mit entsprechenden Erklärungen zu den Abholungen, welche in Ihrer Gemeinde organisiert werden.\nDie Applikation enthält ebenfalls die Funktionalität eine Erinnerung am Tag vor der jeweiligen Abholung gesendet zu bekommen. Außerdem können Sie sich für meldepflichtige Abholungen anmelden indem Sie anrufen oder eine Nachricht an SICA senden.\nBei weiteren Fragen oder Anmerkungen stehen wir Ihnen weiterhin zur Verfügung."

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

Outputs can also be used to switch on heating in wintertime in order to heat your premises awaiting your arrival.\n\nTo consult the history of the events you can easily swipe to the event log page and scroll through the event list to check for example who armed the system at what time or when a door was opened to \nprovide access to a specific user.\n\nTo benefit from this interactivity, we advise you to consult with your installer to enable this functionality towards your Advisor Advanced intrusion system."

      "label": "The refreshingly simple, and remarkably effective, project management platform.\n\nManaging people and projects under pressure is tough enough. Unfortunately, lots of software makes it worse by over-complicating things. Basecamp’s different.\n\nWhat makes Basecamp special?\n\nIt’s dialed in. For nearly two decades, we’ve continually refined a unique set of tools and methods to fundamentally reduce complexity, and make project management more of a joy and less of a chore. Perfected and pressure-tested by hundreds of thousands of teams on millions of projects, Basecamp’s the gold standard for a simpler, superior version of project management.\n\nBasecamp works because it’s the easiest place for everyone in every role to put the stuff, work on the stuff, discuss the stuff, decide on the stuff, and deliver the stuff that makes up every project. Not on separate platforms scattered in various places, but all intuitively organized in one centralized place where everyone can work together.\n\nBasecamp’s intentionally simple by design. It’s why teams that sometimes leave in search of “more power” end up slamming into the consequences of over-powered software: Complexity. Complexity doesn’t work. Basecamp does. It’s why those that leave end up coming back and sticking with us the second time around. You never know what you had until it’s gone."

      "label": "App Info:\nTurnoutNow uses Bluetooth Low Energy technology to capture visitor data in and around your booth. Each attendee will have a wearable beacon on their badge. The beacon emits a unique signal that can be passively captured using the TurnoutNow LeadConnect App while in your booth. In return you get amazing ROI data about your booth and aisle traffic. We encourage all of your reps to use the app because they will receive their individual activity in addition to contributing to the booth data capture. Simply download the app and activate using the code provided. It’s that easy!\nHow it works:\nAn activation code will be provided by TurnoutNow and the event organizer and is specific to your booth. This code may be used for all booth representatives for no additional charge. Each booth representative can simply download and open the app to enter the activation code and name. The app will guide you through the rest. That's it!\n\nHere is the video demonstrating the app:\nhttps://youtu.be/-OmmB3qmq-4\n\nMore Info: \nThe user obtains a code from the trade show event organizer only. The codes are emailed from the event organizer to the exhibitors and sponsors prior the trade show starting so they can download the app and prepare for the event.\nThere is absolutely no cost associated with obtaining a code and the service to the exhibitors and sponsors is free of charge.\nOnce the user is logged into the app, leads can be scanned and attendee information can be captured from the attendee badge, using either camera scanning or NFC feature. This lead scanning helps the app populate permissible information for the exhibitor which can then be utilised as analytics data.\nOnce the data is aggregated we provide the event organizer with all exhibit booth and sponsored area data. The data is then distributed to each exhibitor and sponsor through an online event portal.\n\nDisclaimer:\nPlease note: We've spent years developing the Bluetooth Smart and location technology that powers the TurnoutNow Exhibitor App. This app is extremely power efficient, but with all apps of this type, continued use of Location Services running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password).

You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

Use our free app together with a SumUp mobile card reader to get paid anywhere.\n\nOur app also makes it easy to manage your item catalog, build an online store, sell gift cards, issue invoices, send payment links, and more. These tools are intuitive and involve no binding contracts – all you pay is a fixed fee per transaction. So whether you need a mobile POS solution or you’re looking for new ways to boost your business, we’ve got you covered. \n\nCard payments\nDownload our app and pair your device with a SumUp Card Reader to take chip and contactless payments.

The link will take the customer to a secure website where they can complete the transaction. It’s a great way to take cashless payments without a credit card reader. \n\nInvoices\nWith SumUp Invoices, you can generate professional, legally compliant, on-brand invoices in minutes. When your customer receives an invoice, they’ll have the option to pay securely online. Create and send as many invoices as you like with no service fees.

Now, users who synchronize their Domino mail using Traveler can access additional Notes and Domino capabilities on their iPhone! \n\nPlease note that this application is meant for users who are already using HCL Traveler.\n\nIf you want a mobile alternative to reading Domino-encrypted mail on your laptop, then this is the application for you. Encrypted mail will appear in your Inbox with only a unique, secure link for the Companion application. After entering your Traveler password, the mail will be displayed on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, and then upon exit will leave no decrypted mail on the device -- ensuring the security of your most sensitive corporate data.\n\nHCL Traveler Companion will also allow you to send encrypted mail from your device, and read and respond to other secure messages, such as those marked \"do not copy\" or containing sensitive attachments.\n\nForget to let co-workers know you'll be away on vacation? You can now use Companion to update your Out of Office settings. (Traveler server 9.0.0.1 required.)\n\nCompanion supports the MobileIron® mobile device management environment.  Organizations using MobileIron to manage their mobile applications can securely access their Traveler server and ensure compliance with the organization's device and mobile application security policies.\n\nSimply install the Companion application, refer to the included Help to configure it to use your existing Traveler server, and upon completion of the configuration steps, you are ready to go!  Organizations using MobileIron can even automatically configure Companion.\n\nNote: Before using this application, check with your Traveler administrator. Your Traveler server must be running Traveler 9.0.1.3 (or greater) to support this application. (Traveler server 11.0.0.0 or greater is recommended to take advantage of all of the available features.) Any problems found with the Traveler Companion application or the Traveler server can be reported through your normal HCL support process.\n\n*********************************************** \n\nAll references to Renovations refer to a fictitious company name and are designed for illustration purposes only.

While recruiters are discovering your profile you can always browse through our job listings where you can apply on your own. We rank the 10 most relevant jobs to your specific profile so that you don’t have to scroll for hours!\n\nRecruiters will then see your profile when they are looking to recruit for a specific job, and \nthey’ll send you the job description if they think you’d be a good fit for it (we just heard you screaming \"That is so lit!\", don't pretend you didn't).\n\nThe next steps are up to you! Let them know what you think. If you are interested in the job, they’ll get full access to your CV and will contact you to get the process started. If not, then you won’t hear from them again.\n(But you'll probably keep hearing from us, we're not into one-download stands)\n\nWe're here for you, anytime.

If you’re running the webinar, you can present directly from your iPad, share your iPad’s webcam and chat with other event staff.\n\nFEATURES\n\nFor Attendees\nAttend and participate in online events while you’re on the move.\n   •  Join easily by tapping the online event link in an invite email or your calendar.\n   •  Use a single tap to dial in to the phone conference or connect to audio using WiFi or 4G/3G.\n   •  View the event speaker’s slide presentations up close.\n   •  Participate in polls, raise your hand and ask the event speaker a question.\n   •  View up to 6 webcams on any iOS device. \n\nFor Organizers\nIn addition to the above, as an organizer you can\n   • Schedule Webinars\n   • View previously scheduled Webinars\n   • View the number of registrants for an upcoming Webinar\n   • Share a Webinar registration link via email, SMS, twitter, facebook and more.\n\nFor Panelists\nIn addition to the above, as a panelist you can use your iPad to\n   • Share your webcam\n   • Share a document from your favorite cloud storage app\n   • Chat with other panelists and organizers\n\nHOW TO JOIN AN EVENT\nThere is no purchase necessary to attend a GoToWebinar event. Two easy ways to join:\n   • Tap an event link in the invite email or your calendar.\n   • Tap the GoToWebinar icon after you download the app and enter the session ID.\nNOTE: Presenter controls can be passed to anyone in the event if they have content to share. If you’re using an iPad, you can access and present content stored on cloud services.\n\nAUDIO\n   • Upon joining an event, you will automatically connect to audio through your Internet connection (WiFi or 4G/3G).\n   • For the best audio experience, plug a headset into your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.\n   • If you prefer to dial in over your phone line, you can do that with a single tap after joining the event. \n   • If you are attending the event in person, easily disconnect from audio any time so you can continue to participate in polls and see the speaker’s presentation up close.\nNOTE: Due to network constraints, iPhone users on the Verizon network will be unable to join the event and dial in over the phone at the same time.\n\nVIDEO CONFERENCING\nIf additional presenters are using webcams, you will automatically see them upon joining the event. \n   • GoToWebinar presenters can turn on webcams by tapping the webcam icon then the Share My Webcam button.\n   • While it is possible to stream video over a 4G/3G connection, WiFi is recommended to avoid charges with your network carrier."

      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

For instance, documents, books, receipts, notes, photos, IDs, passports, whiteboards, posters, cards, letters, newspapers, screens, licenses, menus, certificates, music scores, etc.\n\n---\nIMPRESSIVE STORY FROM USER\n\"When my family began trying to share old family letters in the 1980’s, photocopying was the best option. Later, saving scans to CD’s was considered, as was scanning on a printer’s flatbed. Then a few years ago I learned of Tiny Scanner and have never looked back! Tiny scanner does an excellent job of scanning these many hundreds of letters quickly and efficiently—in any setting! Its portability (on my phone) is high on my list of recommendations. Over the few years I have used it, Tiny Scanner has continued to improve its features and make scanning even more convenient.

Ref Tools gives you access to the tools, guidance, support, and information you need—on the job and in the field.    \r\n  \r\nDownload Ref Tools to access the latest version of Magnetic Tool.   \n\nEnsuring that a solenoid valve coil is working properly, or detecting a faulty one, is an important step in many repair or installation projects. Magnetic Tool makes testing a solenoid valve coil quick and easy. Just open the app, hold your smartphone up to the solenoid coil you want to test, and watch for the wheel in the app to start spinning. If it rotates, your solenoid valve is good to go.\n\nIf a solenoid valve is in a tough-to-reach space, you can also set Magnetic Tool to provide audio or haptic (or both) feedback when it detects a magnetic field. That way, you can check on a valve without seeing your screen, so you can maneuver your phone any way you need to.\n\nMagnetic Tool has two modes: Simple and Advanced. With Simple mode, all you need to do is open the app and start testing—it's that simple. Advanced mode allows you to adjust the threshold tolerances of the magnetometer, which is most often used to reduce or eliminate interference from other nearby solenoid valves. \n\nMagnetic Tool is part of the Danfoss CoolApps Toolbox, a collection of mobile apps designed to help installers and service technicians with their daily tasks. See the full collection at CoolApps.Danfoss.com. \n\nSupport \nFor app support, please use the in-app feedback function found in the app settings or send an email to coolapp@danfoss.com \n\nEngineering Tomorrow \nDanfoss engineers advanced technologies that enable us to build a better, smarter and more efficient tomorrow. In the world’s growing cities, we ensure the supply of fresh food and optimal comfort in our homes and offices, while meeting the need for energy-efficient infrastructure, connected systems and integrated renewable energy. Our solutions are used in such areas as refrigeration, air conditioning, heating, motor control and mobile machinery.

I measured the speed a couple of times, and it came up between 10-15 Mb/s.” — © Aleksey Glazunov, life-in-travels.ru\n\n\"Before I found out about MTX Connect, I only ever used Wi-Fi. Finding an open network used to take up a lot of precious time, and checking that everything worked and loaded properly was an adventure in itself. Now I have the internet at my fingertips everywhere I need it.\" —© Denis Mamin, Instagram @ the.qwerty\n\n\"For my first time in Europe — where public Wi-Fi isn't as widespread as I'm used to back home — it was so helpful to have a stable 3G connection I could use to get hold of maps, find places to eat on Instagram or Foursquare, and keep in touch with my host on Airbnb. And I didn't have to huddle in the corner of McDonald's just to check my email! A special thank you to the team at MTX Connect! — \"© Varia Vedeneyeva, Instagram @ varyavedeneeva\n\n\"MTX Connect SIM cards are specifically designed for traveling and working throughout Europe. There's a fixed rate, you can “share” your data allowance by swapping the SIM card to different phones, and the card itself connects to the 3G network of the country you're in. If you're visiting several countries in one trip like us, it's ideal \" — © Hope Kozyrev, Instagram @ tadaetadae\n\n\"With MTX Connect, everything is simple — there's no headache which comes from searching for a mobile phone shop, find the best deal, or sign a contract. We just ordered the card and activated it.”\n© Yulia Zmajevo, Instagram @ ppantera13\n\nUse our app to monitor data use in real-time, top-up your balance, and access our support services.\n\nTop-up your balance with Visa, MasterCard or PayPal."

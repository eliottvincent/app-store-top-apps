You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation.

      "label": "Business made simple\n\nThe SumUp App makes it simple to accept payments and manage your business. Use our free app together with a SumUp mobile card reader to get paid anywhere.\n\nOur app also makes it easy to manage your item catalog, build an online store, sell gift cards, issue invoices, send payment links, and more. These tools are intuitive and involve no binding contracts – all you pay is a fixed fee per transaction. So whether you need a mobile POS solution or you’re looking for new ways to boost your business, we’ve got you covered. \n\nCard payments\nDownload our app and pair your device with a SumUp Card Reader to take chip and contactless payments.

Having your entire inventory at your fingertips makes transactions speedy and simple. You can also organize your items into categories, to make selling even easier.\n\nPayment Links\nThe flexible way to get paid online. Simply enter the amount you want to charge, create a link, and share it with your customer via social media, SMS, or email. The link will take the customer to a secure website where they can complete the transaction. It’s a great way to take cashless payments without a credit card reader. \n\nInvoices\nWith SumUp Invoices, you can generate professional, legally compliant, on-brand invoices in minutes. When your customer receives an invoice, they’ll have the option to pay securely online. Create and send as many invoices as you like with no service fees. There are also no costs for receiving payment by bank transfer – just a small fixed fee for card payments. \n\t\t\nGift Cards\nInterested in a new revenue stream that requires minimal effort? Open the SumUp App and you’ll find a gift card page for your business, ready to share. Your customers can buy digital gift cards for any amount, and personalize them by picking from a range of designs. You can manage the balance of every gift card you sell within the SumUp App."

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

      "label": "Running your business on email, texts, and meetings? It’s time to switch to Basecamp 3 instead. Trusted by hundreds of thousands of businesses worldwide, Basecamp is the saner, organized way to manage projects and communicate within your company.\n\nInside every Basecamp project you’ll find six core tools that will transform your business for the better: \n1. To-dos for tracking work. \n2. A Message Board for posting announcements and updates. \n3. A Campfire chat room for quick casual chats with the team. \n4. A Schedule for posting deadlines and milestones, \n5. Docs & Files for organizing all the assets and notes everyone needs to do their work. \n6. Automatic Check-ins to get insights from the team on a regular basis.\n\nInstead of using MESSY EMAIL CHAINS...\n...you’ll use message boards to keep the conversation organized, centralized, and on the record.\n\nInstead of CONSTANTLY REMINDING PEOPLE WHAT TO DO...\n...Basecamp’s to-do’s keep everything on track. If anything’s late or requires follow up, Basecamp lets you know and holds everyone accountable.\n\nInstead of MEETINGS THAT WASTE TIME AND MONEY...\n...Basecamp’s Automatic checkins prompt people to write up what they’ve worked on every day, every week, once a month — it’s up to you.\n\nInstead of WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON...\n...you’ll use Basecamp’s reports to get the big picture on what’s going on. Across projects, you can see what’s overdue, who’s working on what, what worked was completed on a given day, and much more.\n\n“Simply put, we get more work done, quicker, and better. Productivity is up. Errors are down. Clients are happier.”\n-Patrick Sheffield, Moore Communications Group\n\n“I no longer have to wonder whether I've asked for something to be done or whether it has in fact been done. Every member of my team is more accountable than we were before Basecamp.”\n-John Drover, Roebothan McKay Marshall\n\n“For the first time in a long time our team is truly collaborating, and everyone is moving in the same direction, with the same goals. It's truly remarkable how quickly things have changed in just a week.”\n-Ryan Sullivan, WP Site Care\n\nNote: This app works with Basecamp 3 (the newest major version released October 2015). Basecamp 2 (released March 2012) and Basecamp Classic (released February 2004) accounts require the Basecamp 2 app. Tap “View More by This Developer” to get it."

This gives you an extra layer of security so that you - and only you - can access your applications.\n\nWhen you sign in to Okta, you can use Okta Verify to obtain a temporary 6-digit code or to approve a request notification sent to your device (your organization must enable notifications to use this feature).\n\nOkta values your privacy. Okta Verify does not store personal information - we request permission only for your device camera, which is used to scan a QR code to register your device with Okta.\n\n\nApp Features\n\n* Enroll in Okta Verify as a new user by registering your mobile device with your Okta account.\n* Add one or more Okta accounts that require Okta Verify for authentication.\n* Manage 2-factor authentication for non-Okta applications and web services that require the use of passcodes.\n* Approve or deny sign-in requests on your device from a push notification (if enabled).\n\n\nFor more information, check out our docs at:\nhttps://help.okta.com/en/prod/okta_help_CSH.htm#ext_okta_verify"

Employees of organizations using the Tango Reserve resource scheduling system can now make, check in to, and even cancel reservations while traveling, as long as they have Internet connectivity.\n\nUsing the latest geofencing technology, the device’s GPS notifies you when you are close to the office and asks, “Ready to check in now?” And when plans change, the app makes cancelling reservations easy and convenient to release space and drive utilization even higher.\n\nInstallation and configuration of Tango Reserve by AgilQuest is a prerequisite for using this app.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. This feature may be turned off by disabling the \"Use Location Based Check In\" option under Settings. This action will disable check-in notifications from the app."

With this feature enabled, users will need to provide their password and a time-sensitive verification code generated either in the app or via push notification. UI Verify can also supply users with a set of single-use passwords that can be stored locally on their phones should they ever need to circumvent an issue with their main 2FA method.\n\nFeatures:\n- Instant setup via QR code\n- Supports multiple user accounts and platforms, including Amazon, Facebook, and GitHub\n- Generates time-sensitive verification codes and single-use passwords either in the app or via push notification \n- Unlimited account support"

      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe're always excited to hear from you!

Whova is one of the most widely used mobile apps by professionals for networking at conferences, trade shows, expos, summits, conventions, business meetings, corporate events, association events, and community gatherings. Whova, the Mobile Event App, has received the Event Technology Awards for five years in a row (2016-2021). \n\nWatch this PREVIEW VIDEO to see how Whova can help you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IKTYK8ZS9g\n\nWhat makes Whova special? Whova's technology builds comprehensive profiles of attendees so you can view all attendee profiles before you even arrive at the event or conference. Plan in advance whom to meet at an event, what to talk about with each attendee and reach out to others via in-app messages before, during and after the event. You can also create casual meetups and arrange social activities with other groups of attendees. Whova revolutionizes event networking and significantly improves the ROI of attending events.\n\nYou can also use the Whova conference app to digitize and manage business cards you receive at events. Whova exceeds other business card reader apps like CamCard, CardMunch, ScanBizCards or Scannable etc. by automatically building full profiles using Whova's SmartProfile technology. This allows you to gain deep insights into your contacts' professional backgrounds, work experience, passions, and interests. You can also seamlessly connect with contacts online via LinkedIn and other platforms. Whova's business card scanning feature now supports cards in English, Chinese, and Korean.\n\nWhova is SOC2 Type II and PCI compliant. These security and privacy certificates recognize Whova’s practice of reliable, safe, secure, and trustworthy management of user data protection and privacy.\n\nGet more out of events:\n\n- Never miss important updates: Get instant notifications from event organizers\n\n- Browse comprehensive professional profiles of all event attendees\n\n- Use the Community Board to self-organize social activities and gatherings, coordinate rideshares, break the ice, explore job opportunities, post questions and lost & found items, etc.\n\n- Scan and save business cards and gain deep insights into your contacts\n\n- Send in-app messages and schedule private meetings before and after events\n\n- Access the agenda, GPS guidance, interactive floor maps, parking directions, slides, and photos\n\n- Get involved in event activities through live polling, event gamification, Tweeting, photo sharing, group chatting, and mobile surveys\n\n- Conveniently explore exhibitors' information and get coupons/giveaways with one tap\n\nTestimonials:\n\n- “It makes networking much more effective at this event with 500+ attendees. We no longer have to wander around wondering if we will bump into the person we really would like to meet. “\n\n- “I could see who attended and easily follow up with the people after this entrepreneur/investor event”\n\n- “I have seen other event apps but neither of them provided such valuable information of the attendees. “\n\n- “This app has been fantastic for networking, announcements, agenda, etc., at this one-week conference!”\n\n- “Another great feature of the Whova app is the ability to share slides and documents electronically.”\n\n- \"Whova is an amazing app for keeping track of your connections and storing them in one easy-to-access place. I love the ability to connect with contacts via LinkedIn and the simplicity of emailing potential members.\"\n\nGet in touch:\n\nTo partner with Whova or simply to stay up-to-date with the latest news, please visit our website and follow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/whovasupport\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback!\nContact us at: support@whova.com\n\nAcknowledgements: Icons by Icons8"

      "label": "Never be without a schedule of California’s permanent disability values again.  The iComp Calculator by Haight Brown & Bonesteel, LLP displays the compensation rate and permanent disability value for any date of injury after 1983.  You input the average weekly earnings and it calculates the TTD rate and PD rate.  You input the percentage of permanent disability; the App calculates the number of weeks of payment, the lump sum value of permanent disability and, where appropriate, the life pension weekly rate for percentages up to 99.75%.  You can’t inadvertently use a permanent disability rate out of range for the date of injury, because the application shows the range permitted for each disability percentage and date.\n\nThis tool replaces all the charts and folders practitioners have had to carry around to obtain permanent disability values in California’s complex system.  The calculator is a short-cut that makes PD charts and tables obsolete.  And, it works off-line!   Try it free for 30 days, then purchase it for $4.99 if you want to continue to use it to save time and effort.\n\nNow, the App provides quick and easy assistance in calculating the number of days between any two dates.  When indemnity is paid between the two dates, the App calculates the sum of the benefits paid during multiple broken periods.  Calculating the total of indemnity benefits paid during several broken cycles, the temporary disability owed over broken periods of time, the percentage of permanent disability to be shared by multiple parties - all are part of the 2015 update.   \n\nCaution is of course required when using the App, and no legal opinion is expressed in providing this application or the results it returns.  Each user remains entirely and solely responsible for the proper use of the application, for confirming that the data used is accurate, and for confirming that the answers provided by the application conform to all the applicable provisions of the California Labor Code. Neither Haight Brown & Bonesteel LLP nor TZT&C LLC warrant neither the accuracy of the results nor the proper use of the application.  No liability will be assumed by the publisher, writer or sponsor of the application for its proper use or accuracy."

Trusted by hundreds of thousands of businesses worldwide, Basecamp is the saner, organized way to manage projects and communicate within your company.\n\nInside every Basecamp project you’ll find six core tools that will transform your business for the better: \n1. To-dos for tracking work. \n2. A Message Board for posting announcements and updates. \n3. A Campfire chat room for quick casual chats with the team. \n4. A Schedule for posting deadlines and milestones, \n5. Docs & Files for organizing all the assets and notes everyone needs to do their work. \n6. Automatic Check-ins to get insights from the team on a regular basis.\n\nInstead of using MESSY EMAIL CHAINS...\n...you’ll use message boards to keep the conversation organized, centralized, and on the record.\n\nInstead of CONSTANTLY REMINDING PEOPLE WHAT TO DO...\n...Basecamp’s to-do’s keep everything on track. If anything’s late or requires follow up, Basecamp lets you know and holds everyone accountable.\n\nInstead of MEETINGS THAT WASTE TIME AND MONEY...\n...Basecamp’s Automatic checkins prompt people to write up what they’ve worked on every day, every week, once a month — it’s up to you.\n\nInstead of WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON...\n...you’ll use Basecamp’s reports to get the big picture on what’s going on. Across projects, you can see what’s overdue, who’s working on what, what worked was completed on a given day, and much more.\n\n“Simply put, we get more work done, quicker, and better. Productivity is up. Errors are down. Clients are happier.”\n-Patrick Sheffield, Moore Communications Group\n\n“I no longer have to wonder whether I've asked for something to be done or whether it has in fact been done. Every member of my team is more accountable than we were before Basecamp.”\n-John Drover, Roebothan McKay Marshall\n\n“For the first time in a long time our team is truly collaborating, and everyone is moving in the same direction, with the same goals. It's truly remarkable how quickly things have changed in just a week.”\n-Ryan Sullivan, WP Site Care\n\nNote: This app works with Basecamp 3 (the newest major version released October 2015). Basecamp 2 (released March 2012) and Basecamp Classic (released February 2004) accounts require the Basecamp 2 app. Tap “View More by This Developer” to get it."

With our 4,000+ partnered recruiters (among which BWN, Henkel, Zalando, Amazon, Deutsche Bahn to name a few…) it doesn’t matter if you are looking for an internship during your studies or a full time job right after you graduate: JobTeaser has your back.\n\nIt’s clear and very simple: create your professional profile in a few minutes, upload your CV and other relevant information (your best TikTok is not), and you’re all set. While recruiters are discovering your profile you can always browse through our job listings where you can apply on your own. We rank the 10 most relevant jobs to your specific profile so that you don’t have to scroll for hours!\n\nRecruiters will then see your profile when they are looking to recruit for a specific job, and \nthey’ll send you the job description if they think you’d be a good fit for it (we just heard you screaming \"That is so lit!\", don't pretend you didn't).\n\nThe next steps are up to you! Let them know what you think. If you are interested in the job, they’ll get full access to your CV and will contact you to get the process started. If not, then you won’t hear from them again.\n(But you'll probably keep hearing from us, we're not into one-download stands)\n\nWe're here for you, anytime. Please don't hesitate to reach us out in case of need, and to rate our app!"

For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

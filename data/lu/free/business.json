      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere.

For instance, documents, books, receipts, notes, photos, IDs, passports, whiteboards, posters, cards, letters, newspapers, screens, licenses, menus, certificates, music scores, etc.\n\n---\nIMPRESSIVE STORY FROM USER\n\"When my family began trying to share old family letters in the 1980’s, photocopying was the best option. Later, saving scans to CD’s was considered, as was scanning on a printer’s flatbed. Then a few years ago I learned of Tiny Scanner and have never looked back! Tiny scanner does an excellent job of scanning these many hundreds of letters quickly and efficiently—in any setting! Its portability (on my phone) is high on my list of recommendations. Over the few years I have used it, Tiny Scanner has continued to improve its features and make scanning even more convenient.

You can now use Companion to update your Out of Office settings. (Traveler server 9.0.0.1 required.)\n\nCompanion supports the MobileIron® mobile device management environment.  Organizations using MobileIron to manage their mobile applications can securely access their Traveler server and ensure compliance with the organization's device and mobile application security policies.\n\nSimply install the Companion application, refer to the included Help to configure it to use your existing Traveler server, and upon completion of the configuration steps, you are ready to go!  Organizations using MobileIron can even automatically configure Companion.\n\nNote: Before using this application, check with your Traveler administrator. Your Traveler server must be running Traveler 9.0.1.3 (or greater) to support this application.

      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

The free GoToWebinar mobile app lets you not only see and hear webinars, but take part in them as well. No matter where you are, you can ask questions, take part in polls and more. If you’re running the webinar, you can present directly from your iPad, share your iPad’s webcam and chat with other event staff.\n\nFEATURES\n\nFor Attendees\nAttend and participate in online events while you’re on the move.\n   •  Join easily by tapping the online event link in an invite email or your calendar.\n   •  Use a single tap to dial in to the phone conference or connect to audio using WiFi or 4G/3G.\n   •  View the event speaker’s slide presentations up close.\n   •  Participate in polls, raise your hand and ask the event speaker a question.\n   •  View up to 6 webcams on any iOS device. \n\nFor Organizers\nIn addition to the above, as an organizer you can\n   • Schedule Webinars\n   • View previously scheduled Webinars\n   • View the number of registrants for an upcoming Webinar\n   • Share a Webinar registration link via email, SMS, twitter, facebook and more.\n\nFor Panelists\nIn addition to the above, as a panelist you can use your iPad to\n   • Share your webcam\n   • Share a document from your favorite cloud storage app\n   • Chat with other panelists and organizers\n\nHOW TO JOIN AN EVENT\nThere is no purchase necessary to attend a GoToWebinar event. Two easy ways to join:\n   • Tap an event link in the invite email or your calendar.\n   • Tap the GoToWebinar icon after you download the app and enter the session ID.\nNOTE: Presenter controls can be passed to anyone in the event if they have content to share. If you’re using an iPad, you can access and present content stored on cloud services.\n\nAUDIO\n   • Upon joining an event, you will automatically connect to audio through your Internet connection (WiFi or 4G/3G).\n   • For the best audio experience, plug a headset into your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.\n   • If you prefer to dial in over your phone line, you can do that with a single tap after joining the event. \n   • If you are attending the event in person, easily disconnect from audio any time so you can continue to participate in polls and see the speaker’s presentation up close.\nNOTE: Due to network constraints, iPhone users on the Verizon network will be unable to join the event and dial in over the phone at the same time.\n\nVIDEO CONFERENCING\nIf additional presenters are using webcams, you will automatically see them upon joining the event. \n   • GoToWebinar presenters can turn on webcams by tapping the webcam icon then the Share My Webcam button.\n   • While it is possible to stream video over a 4G/3G connection, WiFi is recommended to avoid charges with your network carrier."

With a single tap, track and save your time with Toggl Track — anywhere you go.\n\nOr maybe you don't really want to use the pesky phone keyboard — we get it. That's why you can now use Siri to track your time with Toggl Track, no keyboard is needed.\n\nToggl Track also has you covered across all of your devices. Start tracking your hours in a browser, then stop it later on your phone or on your Apple Watch with our brand new watchOS app. All your tracked time is safely synced between your iPhone, Watch, desktop, and browser (if you want more of a Pomodoro timer experience).\n\nFEATURES:\n• Pomodoro mode\nEnjoy better focus and productivity by trying out the Pomodoro technique with our brand new Pomodoro mode. The idea behind the Pomodoro technique is that you can work more effectively when you work in timed, 25-minute increments (with breaks in between). Our built-in timer automatically tracks your time in 25-minute increments, with notifications, a full screen mode, and countdown timer to really help you stay focused and on task.\n\n• Reports\nDiscover what's taking up your time and get a snapshot of your day or week with Reports. Analyze your Reports in the app or export them to send the data to your clients (or analyze them further on our web app to see where your hours are going).\n\n• Sync\nKeeps your time seamlessly synced, safely saved, and ready to track on your account, on any device.\n\n• Calendar\nConnect your calendar app to Toggl Track to see all of your calendar events and time entries in the app itself (in the same view), receive notifications before the events start, and most importantly, instantly create time entries based on your calendar events!\n\n• Customize your time entries with projects, clients, and tags\nOrganize and add more details to your time entries by adding meta data on projects, clients, and tags. See exactly where your work hours are going and adjust your schedule and routines accordingly.\n\n• Siri\nToggl Track is compatible with Siri! Start a new time entry, stop it, or access your reports — all that with just a few words.\n\n• iOS Widgets\nStart (and stop) tracking from your iPhone Home Screen.\n\n• Apple Sign-in\nYou can now also sign into our Toggl Track app via your Apple ID.\n\n• Suggestions\nThe more you track, the better the data. The app will give you suggested time entries based on your tracking habits and previous time entries.\n\n• Shortcuts\nUse @ and # to quickly add projects and tags to your time entry and get back to work right away!\n\n• Auto-complete\nEasily find your older time entries and start tracking time on them again.\n\n• Manual Mode\nWant more control? Add and edit all of your time manually and make sure that every second of your time is accounted for. This feature is optional and it's accessible from the Settings menu.\n\n-----\n\n- But what if I'm offline?\nNo problem! You can still track your time through the app, and once you're back online, it will sync seamlessly with your account (and the rest of your devices). Your time is not going anywhere.\n\n- Is the app free?\nYes, Toggl Track on iOS is completely free for you to use.\n\n- Can I send you some feedback?\nYou betcha (and we'd love to hear from you)! You can send us feedback directly from the app. Just look for “Submit Feedback” in the Settings menu.\n\nYep, that's Toggl Track — a time tracking app so simple that you'll actually use it and get stuff done! See where your time goes, focus on important tasks, and boost your productivity. Whether you’re in an office or en route to one, stuck on a space mission to Mars, or just want to see how much time you're wasting on projects that aren't bringing you money — track your time anywhere you go."

      "label": "Salesforce Authenticator adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts as a strong, out-of-band authentication provider. The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

All the features of the web application that you love, packed into a password manager app on your mobile device. Secure encryption, form autofill, biometric and multiple-factor authentication - everything you need to safely generate, store and use your credentials on the go. \n\nWhat’s so special about passbolt mobile?\n\t•\tFully Open source and based on proven security standards. \n\t•\tBiometric authentication - Log in and unlock passwords with fingerprint or face ID \n\t•\t2FA secure login - Use your Yubikey with NFC to securely sign in \n\t•\tAuto-fill - Automatically fill in credentials with ease on your mobile device \n\nBased in Luxembourg, passbolt is secure by default. The open-source password manager’s security model follows strict end-to-end encryption principles. For the mobile app, one of the ways this takes shape is the fact that private keys are transferred from browser to app off the wire, through multiple QR codes. \n\nThe app, like the passbolt project, is always evolving - striving to be better and offer users the best experience with the features they need most.

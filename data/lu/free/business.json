      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

      "label": "The new Boat24 app is different because it was designed for ease of use. Rather than trying to impress with a (usually confusing) plethora of features, the app offers an uncomplicated, easy search for the essentials – of your dream yacht! \n\nBuyers take a more targeted approach. They are looking for quick results from an app with a search function that is both as intuitive and detailed as possible. Whether between meetings, on the underground or just after work before going out with friends.\nThis kind of search on a mobile phone or tablet has been a rather complicated and often frustrating affair until now. Not least because you had to enter the search parameters over and over for each new search attempt.\n\nThe new Boat24 app takes you to your very own personalised wish list or search feed with a single “click”. The trick is that any number of saved searches can be compiled. If one or more of these search feeds come up with additional offers, the app marks them as “new” and places the freshly discovered dream boats at the top of the list. The individual search feeds are also sorted by recency: the app always places the wish or search list to which a new boat has been added at the top.\n\nWhile the new app focuses on personalising the search for the dream yacht, you will still have direct access to the complete range of yachts at Boat24. For those who just want to do a little browsing, the Boat24 app’s editor’s choice offers a selection of new boats and interesting articles.\n\n\nThe NEW app from Boat24: search and find with a single click!"

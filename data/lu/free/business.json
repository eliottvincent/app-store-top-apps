      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

      "label": "ClaroPDF is a professional and user-friendly PDF viewer, reader and annotator. Annotate, mark up and save PDF files which are then still fully compatible with Adobe Reader and other popular PDF apps.\n\n+ Annotations, Notes and Comments\nClaroPDF includes a powerful Annotation toolbar that lets you add notes and other comments. These are fully interchangeable with Adobe Reader and most other popular PDF apps, so your ClaroPDF comments will still be there if you open the PDF on another device. Annotations created in another PDF app can also be viewed and edited.\n\nAnnotation features include: highlight; underscore; strikeout; notes; free text (type straight into the PDF); free line draw (with many colors, opacity and thickness control); shapes (circle, square, line - with many colors, opacity and thickness control); images (you can even insert photos from your iPad camera or photo library into the PDF file)\n\n+ Speech, Productivity and Accessibility\nClaroPDF has access to the full range of iOS system voices and a range of synchronized colour highlighting options. A ‘Speak in Background’ option lets you listen to a PDF while viewing another app - great for proofreading accessible text PDF files while you’re working in other apps. The ‘Speak on tap’ (either from the tapped sentence or the page’s first sentence) and ‘Stop on tap’ options make speech easy to control.\n\nClaroPDF allows the background color of the PDF to be changed, to enhance readability. ClaroPDF fully supports VoiceOver. Image PDF files cannot be spoken by ClaroPDF, but can still be fully viewed and annotated.\n\n+ Smart Zoom\nOn double-tap, ClaroPDF will identify the tapped text block and perform an intelligent zoom on it, just like in Safari. This reduces how much you have to adjust the zoom manually.\n\n+ Full-Text Search & Navigation\nSearch will highlight all found results in your document and let you jump to each one in turn. ClaroPDF shows each page of a multi-page PDF document as a thumbnail, allowing for faster scrolling of long documents. The thumbnails automatically hide when not needed. \n\n+ Managing PDF Files\nPDF files can be opened in ClaroPDF from all other apps, including Mail and Safari. All opened PDF files will be placed in the ClaroPDF Documents List for later viewing. You can also open files from Dropbox, Google Drive, or import files via iTunes. PDF files can be saved into ClaroPDF’s Documents, Dropbox or Google Drive, sent by email, or opened in other apps that support PDF files. ClaroPDF offers the option to email or forward the PDF in a 'flattened format' with annotations made permanent, or send the whole file with editable annotations for further review by others.\n\n+ Fullscreen mode\nAllows the full document to be seen without toolbars in view. Ideal for smaller screens!\n\n+ Accessibility \nClaroPDF allows the background color of the PDF to be changed, to enhance readability. ClaroPDF also fully supports iOS VoiceOver.\n\n+ ClaroPDF vs ClaroPDF Pro\nClaroPDF includes many great features, however, here is a list of what’s only included in ClaroPDF Pro:\n* 4 Nuance Vocalizer text-to-speech voices included as standard.\n* Multimedia: add audio and video files to pages of your PDF file.\n* Folder customisation in the PDF documents list: allows you to organize all your PDFs into different folders.\n* Sync with iCloud: sync your PDF files between devices.\n* Save as PDF app extension: convert text, images and web pages to PDF files from other apps such as Safari. Great for keeping a PDF record of that order confirmation web page!\n* In-app purchases to add more Vocalizer voices and OCR credits.\n\nNeed help with ClaroPDF or have any suggestions? Please email support@clarosoftware.com\n\nLike ClaroPDF? Please leave a review and check out ClaroPDF Pro!"

With our 4,000+ partnered recruiters (among which BWN, Henkel, Zalando, Amazon, Deutsche Bahn to name a few…) it doesn’t matter if you are looking for an internship during your studies or a full time job right after you graduate: JobTeaser has your back.\n\nIt’s clear and very simple: create your professional profile in a few minutes, upload your CV and other relevant information (your best TikTok is not), and you’re all set. While recruiters are discovering your profile you can always browse through our job listings where you can apply on your own. We rank the 10 most relevant jobs to your specific profile so that you don’t have to scroll for hours!\n\nRecruiters will then see your profile when they are looking to recruit for a specific job, and \nthey’ll send you the job description if they think you’d be a good fit for it (we just heard you screaming \"That is so lit!\", don't pretend you didn't).\n\nThe next steps are up to you! Let them know what you think. If you are interested in the job, they’ll get full access to your CV and will contact you to get the process started. If not, then you won’t hear from them again.\n(But you'll probably keep hearing from us, we're not into one-download stands)\n\nWe're here for you, anytime. Please don't hesitate to reach us out in case of need, and to rate our app!"

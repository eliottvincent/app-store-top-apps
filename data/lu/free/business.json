      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

Unfortunately, lots of software makes it worse by over-complicating things. Basecamp’s different.\n\nWhat makes Basecamp special?\n\nIt’s dialed in. For nearly two decades, we’ve continually refined a unique set of tools and methods to fundamentally reduce complexity, and make project management more of a joy and less of a chore. Perfected and pressure-tested by hundreds of thousands of teams on millions of projects, Basecamp’s the gold standard for a simpler, superior version of project management.\n\nBasecamp works because it’s the easiest place for everyone in every role to put the stuff, work on the stuff, discuss the stuff, decide on the stuff, and deliver the stuff that makes up every project. Not on separate platforms scattered in various places, but all intuitively organized in one centralized place where everyone can work together.\n\nBasecamp’s intentionally simple by design. It’s why teams that sometimes leave in search of “more power” end up slamming into the consequences of over-powered software: Complexity. Complexity doesn’t work. Basecamp does. It’s why those that leave end up coming back and sticking with us the second time around. You never know what you had until it’s gone."

Use that code along with your username and password.\n•        Receive a push notification on your mobile device that you approve as authentication. If your organization requires you to define an additional device authentication mechanism to meet the security requirements, you will be prompted for the additional local authentication such as passphrases or biometrics.\n•        Use Touch ID, Face ID, or Passcode in a push notification to authenticate yourself on your mobile device.\nNote: Touch ID or Face ID authentication requires that your mobile device is Touch ID or Face ID capable and that you have registered a fingerprint or facial recognition authentication on the device.\n\nThe strong authentication method you use depends on the method implemented by your participating organization.\n\nYou can generate a security code even if you do not have a network or mobile connection.\n\nQR/App Codes\n\nScan a QR Code at participating organizations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and more to generate a security code every 30 seconds to securely sign in. Enter this security code along with your password to add strong authentication to your favorite websites.\n\nBe sure to read the VIP End User Agreement after downloading VIP Access: https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/end-user-agreement-english"

For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

Alternatively, configure Tag Finder to only detect when the asset is very nearby - allowing rooms full of cages, boxes and racks to be rapidly and efficiently searched.Using the built-in, default configurations or a fully, user-specified operation, Tag Finder can be optimized for your asset environment.\n\nRFID Tag Finder can be configured for tags encoded using:\n\n∙ SGTIN-96\n∙ GRAI-96\n∙ ASCII\n∙ Hex\n\nTo make life even easier all the necessary encoding configuration can be achieved by simply scanning an RFID tag in the desired format.\n\nThe target asset identifier can either be entered manually or be scanned from a barcode.\nSGTIN-96 encoded assets can be specified using GS1 standard identifiers such as GTIN-8, GTIN-12 (UPC), GTIN-13, GTIN-14 or simply using the Item Reference number.\nGRAI-96 encoded assets can be targeted using GRAI codes or plain asset types.\n\nWith Hex or ASCII encoding selected a useful, in-built tag scanning screen generates a list of nearby tags, ranked by signal strength to quickly provide a target identifier when demonstrating or familiarising yourself with the operation of the App.\n\n\nTechnology Solutions (UK) Ltd (TSL) specialises in the design, development and manufacture of Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) and other multi-technology mobile device peripherals that are used to track products, assets, data or personnel. RFID devices are typically used in transport logistics, stock inventory control, and collection of personal data and attendance.\n\nRFID Tag Finder uses TSL's sophisticated, parameterised, ASCII protocol which provides developers with a powerful set of commands to carry out complex UHF RFID transponder operations in a simple, easy to grasp way. Using these simple pre-configured ASCII commands, any TSL ASCII2-compatible UHF RFID reader can be rapidly integrated into applications resulting in un-paralleled levels of productivity.\n\nPlease note that to explore the full capabilities of RFID Tag Finder requires the TSL 1128 Bluetooth UHF RFID Reader or other TSL ASCII2-compatible UHF reader."

Be it at the building site or in the office: Calculate cable diameters quickly, easily and precisely. All you need is an active internet connection.\n\nWhat can the Faber cable calculator app do?\n\nThe Faber cable calculator app serves to perform simple calculations for dimensioning cable diameters.\n\nUpon entry of the:\n\n- Electric power or rating,\n- Cos phi,\n- Length/distance\n\nthe diameter required for copper and aluminium cables is calculated for the most commonly used cable designs and in consideration of the installation types – in ground (direct, conduit/duct), in buildings (in/on walls, in air, cable conductors, cable trays) – and then directly output as a list with the Faber article numbers. The calculated results are directly linked with the Faber product pages and can be sent to any desired e-mail address.\n\n\nHow does the app work?\n\nAfter starting the program, enter the basic settings first:\n• Nominal voltage\n• Maximum permitted voltage drop\n  (further guidelines and standards may need to be observed here!)\n• Cos phi (power factor)\n• Power (in kW) or current (in A) to be conducted\n• Cable length\n\nNow you can enter the installation type:\n\n• Direct in ground\n• In ground (in conduit / in duct, installation type D)\n• Building (in / on wall, installation types A1 to C)\n• Building (in air, installation types E to G)\n\nIf required, you can also enter a different load factor (0.7 or 1). Specific installation types also provide you with an opportunity to select the number of circuits, the ambiant temperature or the installation gap.\n\nThe \"Calculate\" button serves to list every product from the Faber range that meets the entered requirements. The attendant product page is accessible with a single click. The list of matches can be sent to any desired e-mail address. \n\nPlease note: If the entered conditions fail to yield a plausible result (e.g. excessive power or cable length), an error message will be displayed. In this case, halve the power, for example, in order to simply connect two of the calculated cables in parallel.\n\nPlease contact kabelrechner@faberkabel.de with any questions or suggestions you may have, or to report errors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe cable calculator app is free of charge.

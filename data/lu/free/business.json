      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business. Start your business today on the one platform with the ecommerce and point of sale features to start, run, and grow your business."

You can also search for specific text inside long PDF documents and Xodo will automatically re-open files to the last-visited page so you can pick work up where you left off.\n\nWith Xodo PDF Reader & Scanner you have full access to all of your device's files and cloud documents. Whether you want to highlight class notes, alter a recipe, adapt blueprints, revise and sign contracts, fill in forms, or just read a good book, Xodo simplifies your life.\n\nFor Terms of Use, please visit https://pdf.online/legal\nFor Privacy Policy, please visit https://pdf.online/privacy\n\nWe'd love to hear your feedback: support@xodo.com"

When away on business trip or on holiday you can easily check the status of your intrusion system. If you forgot to arm you can take immediate action to arm the system remotely, without having to drive back or to depend on others.\n\nIt also helps to open a door or gate remotely when there is a delivery service. Outputs can also be used to switch on heating in wintertime in order to heat your premises awaiting your arrival.\n\nTo consult the history of the events you can easily swipe to the event log page and scroll through the event list to check for example who armed the system at what time or when a door was opened to \nprovide access to a specific user.\n\nTo benefit from this interactivity, we advise you to consult with your installer to enable this functionality towards your Advisor Advanced intrusion system."

No special knowledge is required for these tasks.\n\nPick the tasks you like\nYou can perform tasks that are better paid, or simply do the ones you like. You might prefer to check an organization's contact details, while others prefer checking whether search results match a particular search query.\n\nFollow your task history\nTrack the status and check the results of your completed tasks in the \"My tasks\" section.\n\nProfile\nFind out how much you’ve earned by checking \"My Profile\". Here, you can also see your skill levels: the higher the number, the more tasks are available to you.\n\nWithdraw funds from your account\nYour earnings are credited to your Toloka account immediately after the requester accepts the task. Earnings are paid in dollars, and you can cash them in your local currency through PayPal, or Payoneer. Depending on where you live, you may also be able to withdraw money via QIWI. And Turkish citizens — through Papara.\n\nPlease note: this app is intended for users over the age of 18.

      "label": "LuxTrust Mobile – carry out your most sensitive online operations directly from your smartphone and without using any hard devices (such as the classic Token or a Scan).\n\nWHAT DOES LUXTRUST MOBILE DO?\nLuxTrust Mobile allows you to:\n- Securely access our partner websites (banks, e-government, …)\n- Confirm and validate online financial transactions\n- Sign documents electronically directly \n- Perform various operations on guichet.lu\n\nHOW TO ACTIVATE IT?\nIf you already are a LuxTrust customer and have your Token or Scan at hand, simply install it and follow the steps indicated in the app. \nIf you are not a LuxTrust client and you want to use the app, order your LuxTrust electronic identity on www.luxtrust.lu. \n\nHOW TO USE IT?\nLuxTrust has three main modes:\n- App2App: Once set-up in your banking app, LuxTrust Mobile can automatically exchange with it so that you do not need to enter an OTP (one-time password). You just have to confirm or cancel the operation. Please check with your bank how to enable this feature.\n\n- Scan the QR code (mosaic image) when connecting to a website using a desktop or tablet:  You will select LuxTrust mobile instead of the Token for instance. You can then scan the QR code displayed after entering your User ID and Password. The app decrypts the image and generates the OTP (one-time password) you need to insert on the website.\n\n- Receive a Push Notification when accessing to our partners’ website from a desktop, tablet or smartphone. Partners’ websites having this feature enabled will automatically send you a notification asking you to confirm or cancel the specific operation. You can also find it under “Pending transactions”.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\nYou can activate your LuxTrust Mobile app on a second device (like a tablet) and enable TouchID or FaceID to unlock it, for more convenience.\n\nDO YOU NEED HELP?\nIf you have any questions or need help, feel free to contact our Helpdesk at +352 24 550 550 or by email at: helpdesk@luxtrust.lu.\n\nSECURITY NOTICE\nBefore installation and as well as during utilisation, please ensure that your devices (smartphone, tablet, etc.) are appropriately secured and protected.

That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

The app sends you a push notification, and you tap 'Approve' for logins and critical actions when it's you, or 'Deny' if it's not. For even more convenience, Salesforce Authenticator can use location services to automatically verify from locations you trust, like your office or home. Better yet, Einstein can save trusted requests for you! Then you need only respond to notifications when something out-of-the-ordinary happens.\n\nYou can also get a verification code when you need one. The codes also work as a backup authentication method if you're on a plane, or have poor connectivity. This means Salesforce Authenticator also works with third-party services that use OATH TOTP tokens. \nhttp://twofactorauth.org.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Rest assured, we go to great lengths to ensure minimal GPS use so that Salesforce Authenticator does not significantly impact your battery life."

      "label": "Being away from your computer doesn’t mean you have to miss out on online events. The free GoToWebinar mobile app lets you not only see and hear webinars, but take part in them as well. No matter where you are, you can ask questions, take part in polls and more. If you’re running the webinar, you can present directly from your iPad, share your iPad’s webcam and chat with other event staff.\n\nFEATURES\n\nFor Attendees\nAttend and participate in online events while you’re on the move.\n   •  Join easily by tapping the online event link in an invite email or your calendar.\n   •  Use a single tap to dial in to the phone conference or connect to audio using WiFi or 4G/3G.\n   •  View the event speaker’s slide presentations up close.\n   •  Participate in polls, raise your hand and ask the event speaker a question.\n   •  View up to 6 webcams on any iOS device. \n\nFor Organizers\nIn addition to the above, as an organizer you can\n   • Schedule Webinars\n   • View previously scheduled Webinars\n   • View the number of registrants for an upcoming Webinar\n   • Share a Webinar registration link via email, SMS, twitter, facebook and more.\n\nFor Panelists\nIn addition to the above, as a panelist you can use your iPad to\n   • Share your webcam\n   • Share a document from your favorite cloud storage app\n   • Chat with other panelists and organizers\n\nHOW TO JOIN AN EVENT\nThere is no purchase necessary to attend a GoToWebinar event. Two easy ways to join:\n   • Tap an event link in the invite email or your calendar.\n   • Tap the GoToWebinar icon after you download the app and enter the session ID.\nNOTE: Presenter controls can be passed to anyone in the event if they have content to share. If you’re using an iPad, you can access and present content stored on cloud services.\n\nAUDIO\n   • Upon joining an event, you will automatically connect to audio through your Internet connection (WiFi or 4G/3G).\n   • For the best audio experience, plug a headset into your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.\n   • If you prefer to dial in over your phone line, you can do that with a single tap after joining the event. \n   • If you are attending the event in person, easily disconnect from audio any time so you can continue to participate in polls and see the speaker’s presentation up close.\nNOTE: Due to network constraints, iPhone users on the Verizon network will be unable to join the event and dial in over the phone at the same time.\n\nVIDEO CONFERENCING\nIf additional presenters are using webcams, you will automatically see them upon joining the event. \n   • GoToWebinar presenters can turn on webcams by tapping the webcam icon then the Share My Webcam button.\n   • While it is possible to stream video over a 4G/3G connection, WiFi is recommended to avoid charges with your network carrier."

      "label": "The CA Mobile OTP app is an all-purpose one-time passcode (OTP) generator that provides an extra layer of security when you shop online or access online accounts. With CA Mobile OTP, you use your mobile device to generate a passcode that can be used to verify a MasterCard or Visa electronic payment transaction, or to login to an online account. This app supports EMV standards when generating the passcode for authenticating MasterCard and Visa online payment transactions. CA Mobile OTP also supports HOTP standards for generating one-time passcodes to use when authenticating to Web portals and VPNs. \n\nHow does it work?\n\nYour card issuer, for example, your bank or the organization where you have an online account, must use the CA Technologies authentication solution. You must sign up for the additional security with them. They will give you a link to download the account onto your device, along with your userid and an activation code. You will run the CA Mobile OTP app on your device and enter the information provided by the organization to activate OTP authentication with this organization. You then choose a personal PIN that will be used to generate an OTP for this account. The OTP can be generated without a connection to your mobile network allowing you to authenticate any time, anywhere using the one-time passcode generated on your device. When you are prompted to authenticate to your online account or to provide a passcode to shop online, you simply run the CA Mobile OTP app, enter your personal PIN, and an OTP is displayed on the device. You then enter the OTP into the application prompt to authenticate your e-payment transaction or to login to your account."

Employees of organizations using the Tango Reserve resource scheduling system can now make, check in to, and even cancel reservations while traveling, as long as they have Internet connectivity.\n\nUsing the latest geofencing technology, the device’s GPS notifies you when you are close to the office and asks, “Ready to check in now?” And when plans change, the app makes cancelling reservations easy and convenient to release space and drive utilization even higher.\n\nInstallation and configuration of Tango Reserve by AgilQuest is a prerequisite for using this app.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. This feature may be turned off by disabling the \"Use Location Based Check In\" option under Settings. This action will disable check-in notifications from the app."

They'll interact with animals in their habitats, hear animal sounds, and discover their behaviors. Capture unique moments from your child’s activities and cherish them forever in the Natoons encyclopedia of animals.\r\nJump aboard your children's first space expedition with the Space Mission experience! They'll enter their spaceship and travel through space to explore the Moon and planets. As they gather every discovery from their mission into story reports, the secrets of the planets will be revealed!\r\n\r\nExperience Augmented Reality with the Family\r\nUse the 3D scan to bring your child’s heroes to life in AR! When your children speak, their characters will repeat their words with different voices while being surrounded by AR environments. They can also virtually feed their characters and guess which foods their characters like the most.\r\nAn extended AR mask collection offers more frames and stickers so your children can embody their heroes and create AR stories to share with the family!\r\n\r\nKid Games and Activities\r\nApplaydu stimulates the creativity of children and enhances different areas of development by covering various topics that are appropriate for kids, such as numbers, colors, vocabulary, geography, and the planets. There are many gameplay types, such as racing, dressing up with princesses, going on animal adventures with Natoons, and even multiplayer mini-games that provide the perfect challenge for kids aged 4 to 9!\r\nSeason 3 brings an extra set of activities! Let your children discover over 30 English vocabulary words with the vocabulary game Word Explorer, and go on a mission to travel to six countries with the Travel Around the World experience.\r\n\r\nParental Controls for a 100% Kid-Friendly Experience\r\nSupervise your child’s experience through a dedicated parental section that keeps track of their progress. Create multiple profiles for your kids and get recommended activities for each through progress reports.\r\nWith Season 3, you can even keep an eye on your children's playtime by setting a screen-time limit.\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nApplaydu, an Official Kinder App, is certified by the kidSAFE Seal Program (www.kidsafeseal.com) and EducationalAppStore.com.\r\nContact us at contact@applaydu.com\r\nFor privacy-related questions, please write to privacy@ferrero.com or go to http://applaydu.kinder.com/legal"

That's why we have developed a revolutionary method for children aged 3 to 12. Children have the brain plasticity to learn new languages far more easily than adults!\n\n====================\nWHY DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS LOVE THE HOLY OWLY METHOD?\nIt's not just an app: Holy Owly is the result of 3 years of research and development within a school, where teachers, linguist researchers and hundreds of children have participated in the development of the pedagogical method and unique content.\nOur commitment:\nOnly 5 minutes a day of learning: this format constitutes a daily ritual encouraging memory anchoring without over exposure to screens,\nChildren learn while having fun: thanks to our teaching method and the immersive adventure in which they participate, they learn 3 words or sentences 6 days a week on a theme from everyday life, \nChildren practice speaking: to learn a language you have to speak it! Our voice recognition system will allow children to practice on their own and improve their pronunciation. We make children proud to express themselves!\nOur content is curated for every age group during childhood, with a personalised course that adapts to each child's learning pace. Each year, children will be able to continue their adventure and continue to enrich their vocabulary and progress in oral expression.  \n\nThe Holy Owly method is organised in 7 stages: Discover, Repeat, Choose, Classify, Memorise, Play and Check. \n\n====================\nRECOMMENDED BY TEACHERS\nHoly Owly is the number one English application for children in France and is also recommended by teachers. Following numerous requests, we have adapted our methodology to schools in partnership with the publisher Bordas, and it is now used in several hundred classes in France! \n\n====================\nIn order to use all the functions of the application, you will have to choose a monthly or yearly subscription. You will have one week free before the first payment.\nTRY IT OUT WITH OUR FREE TRIAL WEEK\n\n====================\nThe content is 100% secure: without ads, children can learn safely.

      "label": "If you want to grow your leadership skills but don't have time to read every book or sift through endless blog posts, you're in the right place.\n\nBUNCH is an AI leadership coach that enables you to get 1% better every day in just 2 minutes a day. Curious? Here's what you need to know:\n\n****Leadership is a mindset, not a title****\nWhether you're leading yourself, a team, or an entire company, you have what it takes to be a great leader. Once you've got the mindset, you just need the tools. That's where BUNCH comes in!\n\n****Become the leader YOU want to be****\nNo two leaders are alike. That's why BUNCH uses psychology & AI to create a completely unique learning journey tailored for your leadership style, your role, and your interests - so you can build the skills that matter to you and your team.\n\n****Straight to the point with no fluff****\nEach day you'll get a bite-sized leadership tip that distills one key concept that's relevant for you, inspired & vetted by real-world leaders. They're designed to understood and remembered - like getting a summary of the best blog post you ever read.\n\n****Learn, act, reflect, repeat****\nTrue, stable growth comes from improving 1% every day. Get your tip, take action, and see how it goes. There is no try, only do!\n\n****Top 5 signs you should get BUNCH****\n=> You love to learn but don't have time to read every book or comb through every HBR article\n=> You want to empower those around you to do their best work but don’t know how\n=> You’re frustrated with your team: missed deadlines, re-work, slow progress\n=> You keep running into the same problems on project after project\n=> It feels like there’s always too much work and not enough time\n\nJoin a movement alongside 40,000+ other leaders. Here’s what they’re saying:\n\n\"After using BUNCH for a few months, I find it to be a helpful tool with constantly new and updated tips on leadership, it is eye opening for me in fields I have not explored before. I can recommend it to anyone responsible for a team's performance. Added bonus is that it comes with a community of leaders I can discuss related-topics with, and get specific advice.\" - Nader Alexan, CTO @ Airteam\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH user for months now, and there aren't many services that I'm this excited about! I genuinely believe it can be the lever to catapult your career or business - especially if you don't have time to read all the latest management books and HBR articles, but you still need to lead people in your work.\" - Srđan Stanić, Software Engineer at Gravitus\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH beta tester since the very beginning. Over the last year I've watched the app and the content grow into a truly meaningful product experience. Leaders at all levels can benefit from adopting the 2-minute daily habit. I love binging on tips in my free time, and often share content with my team.\" - Merissa Silk, Head of Product @ fundingport\n\n\"I almost dislike how popular BUNCH is becoming because as a beta user, it always felt like my own personal secret weapon! The coach makes it easy to have a moment of reflection each day, and having met the team behind it, I know they’re serious about their mission and vision to enable anyone to be a better leader.\" - Javier Gutiérrez Boronat, Agile Coach & Entrepreneurship Facilitator\n\n“Bunch gave me a template for how to call out team members who’ve gone above and beyond. The team loves it, and It’s really helped them gain a sense of what excellence looks like in their role.” - Cynthia Gordon, Customer Experience Leader @ [monday.com](http://monday.com/)\n\nReady to take the lead? Try it for a couple of weeks and let us know what you think!\n\n—\nData Protection: [https://www.bunch.ai/data-protection](https://www.bunch.ai/data-protection)\nTerms and Conditions: [https://www.bunch.ai/terms-conditions](https://www.bunch.ai/terms-conditions)"

      "label": "Try the best app on AppStore to teach kids handwriting! This free version has all of the features of iTrace, but has a limited set of letters, words and settings.\n\n\"With an engaging, kid-friendly interface and many options to customize and track children's progress, iTrace is a valuable app for parents, teachers and occupational therapists.\",  \nLibby Curran, People Magazine's Teacher of the Year\n\n---------------\nOnce you unlock all of the premium features, you will be set.\n\nWe designed iTrace over 5 years ago to teach children to write block and cursive letters and numbers.  Our mission back then — and today — remains to make early childhood education productive and relaxed, natural at the same time. \n\nWhile creating the app, we found out that children learn best when they repeat every exercise at least 3 times. In iTrace, a child traces each letter 3 times on every level out of 30 for each letter. Of course, every child learns at a different pace, so an app adjusts the number of levels to meet the needs of their individual student.\n\nThe app is ideal for homeschooling as well as classroom setting at Preschool, Pre-K, Kindergarten, and K1-K2 levels.\n\niTrace Key Features: \n- Uppercase and lowercase letters \n- Cursive and block letters\n- Numbers 0 through 9\n- Words: child's name, 350 preloaded words from the iTrace library and unlimited words that can be added by you\n- Support of 3 different letter fonts: Zaner-Blosser, HWT (Handwriting Without Tears) and D'Nealian (with customized letters for each font!)\n- Full support for both Left and Right handwriting orientation.\n- 5 animated scenes that gather relevant words together to make learning fun with 50 animated objects (iPad only)\n- History of each child's progress\n- Unlimited children accounts \n- Available at a reduced price with Volume Purchase Program for educational institutions\n\n\nWe created iTrace for kids: \n- The app tracks and adjusts to your child's individual progress to keep their interest and to encourage progress\n- To support how children learn writing skills, iTrace will replay exercises several times gradually increasing complexity and difficulty level (just like a game!) \n- The app will reward progress with over 600 varying prizes for every completed exercise\n- iTrace leverages context and animation to teach writing by encouraging children to select animated scenes composed of meaningfully combined objects\n\nWe created iTrace to help parents and teachers: \n- The app tracks your child's progress on each individual letter and number to help them master handwriting and for adults to measure improvement\n- iTrace supports easily switching to the Left-handed mode and to cursive letters. \n- For offline practice, iTrace supports customization and printing of PDF worksheets on the paper.\n\nWe built iTrace to guard children’s privacy: \n- No ads inside the app.  We do not interrupt the learning process with anything unhelpful or irrelevant. \n- No collection of personal data. We do not ask for any contact details except the first name of your student to personalize their experience. \n- Purchases can only be made by adults from a part of the app that children cannot access.\n------------\nFeatured in the App Store's \"Education\" category under Best New Apps!\n\n— TUAW: \"The app is brightly illustrated and well designed, certain to appeal to young students. Meant for the core 3-7 age group, kids can learn to trace uppercase and lower-case letters, as well as numbers.\"\n---------------\n\nIf you have any ideas or feedback that you would like to share, please contact us at iTrace@devpocket.com.  We are sincerely interested in knowing more about your experience with iTrace."

You can even define your own experiments on phyphox.org and share them with colleagues, students and friends.\n\nSelected Features:\n- A selection of pre-defined experiments. Just press play to start.\n- Export your data to a range of widely used formats\n- Remote-control your experiment through a web interface from any PC on the same network as your phone. No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "iNaturalist is a social network for sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. The primary goal is to connect people to nature, and the secondary goal is to generate scientifically valuable biodiversity data from these personal encounters. \n\niNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals with visually similar suggestions and verification by dedicated contributors. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you'll create research-quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n• Identification suggestions: Take or import a photo and view the top 10 most visually similar species matches and tap through to get more information. You can view these suggestions even before creating an account.\n• Feedback from our community: Create an account to share your observations and start a conversation about what you saw. Can’t identify the organism? Start with a broad identification like “plants” or “fungi” so others with more expertise can find it and refine the identification. \n• Keep a record of all living things: Build your life list by posting to iNaturalist. Where, when, and what you saw is the basis of each observation you create.\n• Grounded in science: Every identification is connected to the tree of life, which means you can search for broad classifications like “Ferns” or “Fungi” as well as species-level identifications like “Humpback Whale” (and everything in between). \n• Advancing science & conservation: Millions of observations created and identified by the iNaturalist community are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility where they are used to advance scientific understanding of biodiversity through open data and open science. \n• Enabling citizen science and community science: Join any of the tens of thousands of projects around the world on iNaturalist to draw attention to and collect data about particular species or places.\n• Not-for-profit: iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, both 501(c)3 nonprofits in the United States. iNaturalist is free for anyone to use thanks to the generous support of many organizations and individuals. Thank you!\n• No hidden charges: This app is truly free because we believe nature is for everyone.\n• Best for wild plants and animals: The iNaturalist community is better at identifying wild plants and animals than those in gardens or horticulture. Get outside and find what’s wild!\n• Control how your location is shared: Set the privacy to obscured (only general location is shared) or private (no location is shared at all, but much harder for others to help identify). The locations of species at risk from disturbance are automatically obscured.\n• More than a mobile app: iNaturalist has even more extensive features and tools for learning and exploration. Get the full experience at inaturalist.org!\n• 35+ languages: iNaturalist has been translated into dozens of languages thanks to multilingual enthusiasts who want to see the community grow.\n• A global network: iNaturalist is used in every country on earth! In many countries, we have formal agreements with local organizations to promote iNaturalist. Use this app for contributing to all iNaturalist Network sites, including Naturalista (Mexico and Colombia), iNaturalist.NZ (New Zealand), iNaturalist.ca (Canada), Biodiversity4All (Portugal), iNaturalistAU (Australia), iNaturalistPa (Panama), iNaturalistEc (Ecuador), ArgentiNat (Argentina), iNaturalistil (Israel), and iNaturalistFi (Suomi/Finland)."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

In our app, drawing gets children excited even for letters and numbers!\n\nIn preschoolers, drawing plays an important role in the development of the right side of the brain. As they draw, children process information in multiple ways, such as with their eyes and body, as well as emotionally. We created the Drawing Academy app with all this in mind.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 150 step-by step drawing tutorials in 10 thematic sets with different complexity levels for kids aged 2 to 6\n- “ABC\" and \"Numbers” packs to get children interested in learning letters and numbers through drawing with pictures they make themselves\n- a huge variety of tools, including pencils, crayons, stickers, patterns, and paints\n- tracing and free-drawing mechanics to help prepare your child’s hand for writing with step-by-step motor-skill refinement, from the moment they first scribble to their finalized masterpieces\n- activities that form a customized age-based learning program, taking your child’s interests into account\n- unique easy-to-follow tracing exercises that guide your child’s creativity without limitations and stimulating free drawing\n\nDrawing Academy isn’t just another coloring book!\n\nNote: only part of the content in the screenshots is available in the free version of the application. To gain access to the full version, you will need to make an in-app purchase.\n\nSubscription Details\n\nGet access to over 100 cute characters and drawings after subscribing to the Drawing Academy.

      "label": "Prosodiya ist ein innovatives Förderkonzept zur Verbesserung der Lese- und Rechtschreibleistung von Grundschulkindern mit und ohne LRS.\r\n\r\nMit Prosodiya trainieren Kinder den deutschen Sprachrhythmus Schritt für Schritt zu erkennen. Sie üben einzelne Wörter in Silben einzuteilen und die betonte Silbe zu erkennen. Anschließend lernen sie, wie sie diese sprachrhythmischen Merkmale mit Rechtschreibregeln verbinden können. Mit Hilfe dieser Fähigkeiten werden die Kinder in die Lage versetzt, systematischer und leichter Lesen und Schreiben zu lernen.\r\n\r\nInhalte\r\n- Über 400 der wichtigsten Wörter des deutschen Grundwortschatzes\r\n- Bildliche Darstellung aller Wörter für einen besseren Lerneffekt\r\n- Kindergerechte und verständliche Mitmach-Erklärungen der Lernstrategien und Aufgaben\r\n- Kinder können Prosodiya eigenständig ohne Hilfe von Eltern nutzen\r\n- Spannende Hintergrundgeschichte mit vielen fesselnden Bildern aus der Fantasiewelt Prosodiya \r\n\r\nZiele\r\n- Betonungsmuster und Silbengrenzen erkennen\r\n- Offene Silben (lange Vokale) und geschlossene Silben (kurze Vokale) erkennen und verstehen\r\n- Konsonantenverdoppelungen wie pp, tt, mm, ck, tz und Dehnungszeichen wie ie, stummes h erkennen und verstehen\r\n- Wörter mit Hilfe der gelernten Merkmale richtig schreiben\r\n- Kontinuierliche Anpassung an den individuellen Leistungsstand jedes Kindes\r\n\r\nZielgruppe\r\nDer Inhalt von Prosodiya ist an den meisten Grundschulen Inhalt der 2. und 3. Klasse. Das Förderprogramm ist jedoch auch für Kinder höherer Klassenstufen mit Lese- und Rechtschreibproblemen geeignet. \r\n\r\nTrainingsempfehlung\r\n- 15 bis 20 Minuten pro Tag\r\n- 4 bis 5 Trainingstage pro Woche\r\n- Die Gesamttrainingsdauer beläuft sich auf mindestens 8 Wochen. Durch die kontinuierliche Anpassung wiederholen schwache Kinder mehr und trainieren damit über einen längeren Zeitraum.\r\n\r\nAuszeichnungen\r\nProsodiya erhielt den European Serious Game Award auf der Games and Learning Alliance Konferenz 2017 in Lissabon. \r\n\r\nFörderungen\r\n-EXIST-Gründungsstipendium des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Energie\r\n-Digital Content Fund der Medien- und Filmgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg\r\n\r\nErgebnis wissenschaftlicher Forschung\r\nBereits 2009 begann Dr. Katharina Brandelik damit zu untersuchen, ob ein Zusammenhang zwischen den sprachrhythmischen Fähigkeiten und den Lese-Rechtschreibfähigkeiten von Kindern besteht. Im Rahmen ihrer Dissertation an der Universität Tübingen konnte sie zeigen, dass Kinder mit LRS häufig Probleme bei der Wahrnehmung des Sprachrhythmus haben. Hierfür erhielt Frau Dr. Brandelik 2014 den Wissenschaftspreis des Bundesverbandes für Legasthenie & Dyskalkulie e.V.\r\nBasierend auf diesen Erkenntnissen wurde in 2014 mit der Entwicklung des Prosodiya-Förderprogramms begonnen. Seit Beginn erfolgt die Entwicklung in Kooperation mit der Universität Tübingen, Prof. Dr. Jürgen Heller, Forschungsmethoden und Mathematische Psychologie und Prof. Dr. Detmar Meurers, Computer Lingustik sowie dem Lernforum Brandelik, einem Nachhilfe- und Lerntherapieanbieter. Inzwischen besteht die Prosodiya-Forschungsgruppe aus Dr. Katharina Brandelik, Jochen Brandelik, Heiko Holz und Benedikt Beuttler. \r\n\r\nDr. Heiko Holz hat 2018 eine Prosodiya-Förderstudie im Rahmen der Graduiertenschule & Forschungsnetzwerks LEAD durchführt. Es haben 129 Grundschulkinder der zweiten bis vierten Klasse teilgenommen und über 9 Wochen ca. 5-mal pro Woche für je 20 Minuten mit Prosodiya trainiert. Die Kindern wurden in zwei Gruppen aufgeteilt und die Gruppen haben Zeit versetzt trainiert.  An je 3 Terminen wurden die Rechtschreibleistungen sowie die Fähigkeit, Betonungsmuster wahrzunehmen, überprüft. Die Ergebnisse der Studie legen nahe, dass die Kinder durch das Training mit Prosodiya sowohl ihre Rechtschreibleistung als auch ihre Betonungswahrnehmung deutlich verbessern konnten.\r\n\r\nMehr Informationen finden Sie unter https://prosodiya.de\r\nBedingungen und Konditionen unter: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula"

      "label": "Tracing Projector is your personal portable drawing and composition tool.\n\nHaving Tracing Projector is like always having a sheet of tracing paper with you! Choose any image you'd like to draw, take a photo, or choose from hundreds of images supplied in the app; then look at your screen while you trace the image on paper!\n\n- Learn to Draw! Learn proportions and important lines by tracing photos of anything! Use several filters to enhance your photo, making it easier to trace.\n\n- Make real one-of-a-kind artwork you can hang on your wall! Send unique greetings on social media! Friends and family will love to see your animated drawings!\n\n- Show off your skills! Record a video while you draw and share it on your favorite social network. Your friends will be amazed! Choose from time-lapse and regular speeds, and include a narrative if you want to. \n\n- Great for face painting or artistic makeup!\n\n- Great for school projects! Need to draw an image from a book on a poster? Trace it!\n\n- Kick-start your painting or portrait! Transfer your idea from a photo to your drawing canvas to get the proportions right.\n\n- Match the Composition! Transfer your plan from a sketch to the scrapbook page or photo wall! \n\n- Challenge yourself to sketch the essence of the image before the timer runs out! Focus on composition and structure. Freehand the fine details afterward, or disable Quick Sketch and trace them directly. (Disabling requires a one-time purchase.)\n\nSeveral tools make it really easy to trace your image:\n\n- Light Table - lock your screen, turn up the brightness, and trace the image from your screen directly!\n\n- Handheld Mode -- On supported devices, Augmented Reality keeps your tracing image steady while you hold your device at a comfortable angle. (demo video https://youtu.be/YJeK5Sjdi1Q). Requires iOS 11.3 or later on iPhone 6s/6s Plus or iPad Pro and later. Works best on stable horizontal and vertical surfaces with good light and some visible surface detail.\n\n- Lock the camera focus to keep the image steady while you trace.\n\n- Lock the canvas area to keep your layout and alignment while you zoom in to get a close look at your work in progress.\n\n- Several Filter modes enhance your image, increasing contrast to give you a better result.\n\n- Use the flashlight to light up your drawing. (requires Full Version)\n\n- Use the selfie camera and draw on your face. (requires Full Version)\n\n\nOther features make it fun and easy to share your creations with your friends.\n\n- Video recording in Time Lapse mode to make things smaller and faster and cooler. You can enable normal-speed and audio on the Settings screen.\n\n- The recorded video or snapshot includes a small thumbnail of the tracing image (with an option to turn that off).\n\n- Your videos and snapshots are stored automatically and available to share later from within the app, the Files app, or iTunes.\n\n- Sharing your videos and photos is easy with a preview screen and saved photos/videos!\n\n- Interrupted while recording your drawing? No problem - Combine multiple videos to create a single video for sharing! Use the Edit feature on the Saved Files screen: select two movies and tap Join.\n\n\nTracing Projector is Enhanced For 3D Touch! Start right away from the camera or photo album from the home screen! Force-touch on the tracing image to peek at your progress while you draw!\n\n\nNotes:\n- For best results, stabilize your device above your drawing surface. A stack of books, drinking glass, or tripod works best.\n- The app requires access to your camera in order to present its overlay for drawing.\n- The app requires access to your photos in order to load an image to trace and to save the video of your drawing.\n- The app optionally uses your microphone when recording a video while you draw."

      "label": "Word Tag works\nGet ready to be outsmarted by your kids. This game will increase their vocabulary performance by 43% in just four weeks!\n\nIn 20 minutes of gameplay a day – with eight exposures to every new word over three weeks – you'll see your child's confidence soar and their schoolwork improve. While kids are focused on having fun and acing the game, they will be learning up to 1,000 new words a year, all personalized to their level. The learning happens almost invisibly, so they learn more because they are having fun (and it doesn’t feel like homework). And while they are busy getting all the fun rewards, you can track their advancement on a progress report showing all the pedagogical activities behind the chest of treasures your kid accumulates in the game.\n\nWith characters designed by Craig Kellman (Madagascar, Hotel Transylvania), developed by the brilliant designers of Subway Surfers, crafted on the foundations created by the award-winning team of Mrs Wordsmith, and backed by a stellar team of literacy experts, Word Tag will have a lasting impact in the education and entertainment of the whole family. \nOur unique pedagogical approach was developed and endorsed by Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\n\nHow does it work, you ask? \nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory.\nWe developed several mini-games, to be played in a specific order, carefully scaffolded, with each mini-game building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning.\n\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across four different game activities:\n\nWild Styling Syllables: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word.\n\nWild Styling Synonyms: It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\n\nContext Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\n\nPop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz.\n\nWord Tag uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\n\nThe words kids see are tailored to their needs, including:\n\nCreative writing and literature words\nTextbook words from the Lexile database\n\nUS exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\nUK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\nInspirational words\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\n\nFor more information, have a look through our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

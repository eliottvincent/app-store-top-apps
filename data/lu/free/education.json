      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Lingvist is the language learning app built by scientists and language experts that teaches vocabulary better than anyone else in the world. The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian, Japanese and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

      "label": "The “Travel Phrasebook” App has many useful foreign phrases and words (e.g., “Thank you!”, “How much?” or “A table for two, please!”). \n\nWhen you tap a phrase, the app speaks it aloud. There is no guessing as to how to pronounce the words. And if the app is talking too quickly for you, simply tap the snail/turtle icon to hear the words more slowly. Listen to pronunciation recorded by native speaker and then record and play back your own voice to practice your foreign language speaking skills!\n\nWhen traveling to foreign countries, make sure you bring the app with you! Ideally you listen to a phrase and repeat it, but if your accent is terrible, you can play the voice on the app to local people (e.g., a waiter or store clerk). Language barrier while travelling abroad will no longer exist!\n\n--- FEATURES ---\n\n1. Many useful foreign phrases & words\n2. Pronunciation recorded by native speaker\n3. Voice recording & playback\n4. No Internet connection required\n5. Instant search by keywords\n6. Customizable font size\n\nWelcome to download the “Travel Phrasebook” app!

      "label": "Readwise helps you get the most out of what you read by making it fun & easy to revisit your highlights from all your favorite reading platforms in one place. \n\nQuickly synchronize your highlights from Kindle, Apple Books, Instapaper, Pocket, Medium, Goodreads, and even paper books. Then start building a daily review habit using the app and daily email. By reviewing your highlights every day, you'll retain dramatically more and you'll finally stop forgetting all the details from books you just finished!\n\n---\n\n“Readwise is my favorite new service this year. Save highlights from Kindle, Instapaper, and now tweets... one of the best long-term personal learning tools I’ve come across.” — Caleb Hicks\n\n“Besides my Kindle, Readwise has been the most influential tech for improving my reading process.” — Blake Reichmann\n\n“If you use Kindle or Instapaper or just enjoy keeping and reading highlights, please sign up to Readwise. It will become one of your cherished services.” — Christopher Galtenberg\n\n---\n\nACTUALLY USE YOUR HIGHLIGHTS\nHighlighting is great, but why bother if you're never going to see any of your highlights again? Readwise makes it easy to quickly liberate all your highlights into one place, ensuring that you'll actually see and use them, including highlights from:\n\n• Amazon Kindle\n• Apple iBooks\n• Instapaper\n• Pocket\n• Medium\n• Goodreads\n• Twitter\n• Physical Books (using OCR)\n• Manual Input\n• CSV Upload\n\n\nSTOP FORGETTING WHAT YOU READ\nHow often do you finish a book, only to forget the key ideas two weeks later? We don't remember things by just reading them once.\n\nReadwise solves this problem using scientifically proven learning techniques called Spaced Repetition and Active Recall. Readwise resurfaces the right highlights at the right times using a daily email and an app. Readwise even makes it possible to convert your best highlights into flashcards for added retention.\n\n\nTAG, NOTE, SEARCH, AND ORGANIZE\nWith your highlights all in one place, Readwise enables you to organize and connect these ideas in new ways. Use search to find a highlight instantly; use tag to organize highlights within your library; use notes to add your own annotations.\n\n\nHIGHLIGHT PAPER BOOKS\nReadwise also makes it possible to take highlights from your physical books and papers using your phone’s camera. Just snap a pic, highlight with your finger, and have your favorite highlights saved forever.\n\n---\n\nIf you are not already a Readwise subscriber, you can get started immediately with a 30-day free trial with no credit card upfront. At the end of the trial, you will not be charged unless you choose to subscribe to Readwise Full or Readwise Lite. Price may vary by location. Manage your subscription from your dashboard.\n\n---\n\nSupport:  Check out readwise.io/faq or email us at hello@readwise.io\nPrivacy Policy: https://readwise.io/tos\nTerms of Service: https://readwise.io/privacy"

That's why we have developed a revolutionary method for children aged 3 to 12. Children have the brain plasticity to learn new languages far more easily than adults!\n\n====================\nWHY DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS LOVE THE HOLY OWLY METHOD?\nIt's not just an app: Holy Owly is the result of 3 years of research and development within a school, where teachers, linguist researchers and hundreds of children have participated in the development of the pedagogical method and unique content.\nOur commitment:\nOnly 5 minutes a day of learning: this format constitutes a daily ritual encouraging memory anchoring without over exposure to screens,\nChildren learn while having fun: thanks to our teaching method and the immersive adventure in which they participate, they learn 3 words or sentences 6 days a week on a theme from everyday life, \nChildren practice speaking: to learn a language you have to speak it! Our voice recognition system will allow children to practice on their own and improve their pronunciation. We make children proud to express themselves!\nOur content is curated for every age group during childhood, with a personalised course that adapts to each child's learning pace. Each year, children will be able to continue their adventure and continue to enrich their vocabulary and progress in oral expression.  \n\nThe Holy Owly method is organised in 7 stages: Discover, Repeat, Choose, Classify, Memorise, Play and Check. \n\n====================\nRECOMMENDED BY TEACHERS\nHoly Owly is the number one English application for children in France and is also recommended by teachers. Following numerous requests, we have adapted our methodology to schools in partnership with the publisher Bordas, and it is now used in several hundred classes in France! \n\n====================\nIn order to use all the functions of the application, you will have to choose a monthly or yearly subscription. You will have one week free before the first payment.\nTRY IT OUT WITH OUR FREE TRIAL WEEK\n\n====================\nThe content is 100% secure: without ads, children can learn safely.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Word Tag works\nGet ready to be outsmarted by your kids. This game will increase their vocabulary performance by 43% in just four weeks!\n\nIn 20 minutes of gameplay a day – with eight exposures to every new word over three weeks – you'll see your child's confidence soar and their schoolwork improve. While kids are focused on having fun and acing the game, they will be learning up to 1,000 new words a year, all personalized to their level. The learning happens almost invisibly, so they learn more because they are having fun (and it doesn’t feel like homework). And while they are busy getting all the fun rewards, you can track their advancement on a progress report showing all the pedagogical activities behind the chest of treasures your kid accumulates in the game.\n\nWith characters designed by Craig Kellman (Madagascar, Hotel Transylvania), developed by the brilliant designers of Subway Surfers, crafted on the foundations created by the award-winning team of Mrs Wordsmith, and backed by a stellar team of literacy experts, Word Tag will have a lasting impact in the education and entertainment of the whole family. \nOur unique pedagogical approach was developed and endorsed by Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\n\nHow does it work, you ask? \nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory.\nWe developed several mini-games, to be played in a specific order, carefully scaffolded, with each mini-game building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning.\n\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across four different game activities:\n\nWild Styling Syllables: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word.\n\nWild Styling Synonyms: It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\n\nContext Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\n\nPop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz.\n\nWord Tag uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\n\nThe words kids see are tailored to their needs, including:\n\nCreative writing and literature words\nTextbook words from the Lexile database\n\nUS exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\nUK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\nInspirational words\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\n\nFor more information, have a look through our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

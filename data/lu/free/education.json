Listen to pronunciation recorded by native speaker and then record and play back your own voice to practice your foreign language speaking skills!\n\nWhen traveling to foreign countries, make sure you bring the app with you!

Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n• 2019 PCMag Editors’ Choice\n• 2019 Tabby Awards Winner\n• 2019 Best Mobile App Awards: Best Designed App and Best Overall App\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next.

      "label": "Want to learn a new language? The SPEAKIT Online Language Courses will make language learning much easier and a whole lot more fun than you ever thought possible!  \nEach SPEAKIT language-learning course includes 20 videos (a total of around 2.5 hours), with each video covering a different everyday situation, from getting to know people to talking on the phone to shopping - and even to doing business! All in all, you’ll learn a total of 600 essential vocabulary items and useful phrases. \n\nWhen taking a course, you’ll listen to the language, read the subtitles, and repeat each word or sentence you hear - not just once, but twice! This gives you a chance to read... to absorb... and to speak! And, hey, if it doesn’t work for you the first time, it will work the second time or maybe the third. Practice as many times as you want, whenever you feel like it! The most important thing to remember is that you should never to be afraid to speak. OK, so others will guess it’s not your native tongue. So what? Language brings people together, and people always appreciate it when you try to speak their language, even if you make a few mistakes…\nEach SPEAKIT language-learning course includes the following videos:\nPreface and Introduction\n1. Things You Need to Know\n2. Starting to Speak\n3. How Much, How Many?\n4. Common Questions\n5. Important Words\n6. Adjectives\n7. Numbers\n8. Colors\n9. Days of the Week\n10. Telling the Time\n11. Personal Details\n12. Hotels \n13. Car Rentals\n14. Friends and Business\n15. A New Language\n16. Phone Conversations\n17. Restaurants and Food\n18. Taxis\n19. Public Transportation\n20. Shopping\nReady to start learning a new language? Let’s get started!\n\n****************\nNOTE: In this version only Chapter 1 (\"Basic words - Thinks you need to know\") and Chapter 12 (\"Hotels\") are available. Upgrade with In App Purchase for the FULL VERSION to download all movies of the course. Enjoy!\n****************\n\nAbout Us\nAt SPEAKIT we have 25 years of experience researching and producing unique products in the field of language learning—and that research tells us that when it comes to language learning, you’ve probably had enough of old-fashioned textbooks, flashcards, and even audio books! So we put our heads together to figure out the best way to learn a new language nowadays—a way that would grab and hold your attention, help you really understand and remember what you’ve learned, and be convenient and cutting-edge.\nWhat did we come up with? The SPEAKIT Online Language Courses. Each course is made up of a set of videos that teach you all of the basic words, phrases, and sentences you need to know, and explain exactly when you would want to use them. But you don’t just see and hear the words. The lessons are taught by presenters in a relaxed and friendly way, so that they feel a lot like a one-on-one session. \nYou can watch the videos in any order you like, jump from place to place within a video, stop and restart… How cool and convenient is that? \nWe hope you enjoy the SPEAKIT Online Language Courses. We sure enjoyed producing them for you!"

      "label": "Popsicle Sticks: Teacher Picks replaces your mug of popsicle sticks. Use it to randomly select and group students, to pick random numbers and simulate dice rolls, to score responses during discussions, to create classroom tournaments, and to energize your daily roll call! Its features include:\n\nRANDOM SELECT\nSelect students randomly one student at a time. Use the \"Random Bar\" slider to precisely set the \"randomness\" of the next selection; from \"uncalled students only\" to \"completely random\" (and everywhere in-between). And although your students may not always love being selected, they will love listening to Siri say their name! (But rest assured, there is a \"Mute\" button for text-only selections.)\n\nRANDOM GROUPS\nPut students into random groups with just a couple taps. If the groups need a little tweaking, you can \"swap\" students with the Swap button. Easily view the \"jigsaw\" version of any random grouping, or create \"round-robin pairings\" for multi-day partner activities. Utilize the Share button to export a grouping (onto a white board, for example).\n\nRANDOM LIST\nRandom List displays your class list in random order. Need a better system for picking the next student to take down the attendance, or to choose a birthday donut? Random List is the answer. Create, save, and export random lists for just about anything.\n\nDIGITAL DABBLE\nPlay Digital Dabble with your students to improve their mental math skills. For each round of Digital Dabble, Popsicle Sticks generates a random set of digits (from a dice roll) and a target number. The challenge for your students is to use the digits to make an equation equal to the Target Number. Think digital!\n\nRAD ROLL CALL\nInvigorate your daily attendance with Rad Roll Call! Start each day by choosing one of over 200 Rad Roll Call questions. Students confirm they are present by responding to the question. Their answers (as well as the day's attendance) are saved and used for the Roll Call Recall game, where students earn points for remembering their classmates' responses.\n\nTOURNAMENT BUILDER\nWith just a few taps, create a class tournament for almost any game (educational or otherwise). You can set it up for students to compete individually or in teams. You control the composition of the teams and the number of games. Choose from round-robin, single-elimination, or \"quick-tournament.\" Record game results with a single tap. Popsicle Sticks will keep track of the standings, and, if you'd like, automatically slot the best players (or teams) into an end-of-tournament playoff! May the best student win! \n\nSCORED DISCUSSION\nUse Scored Discussion to track student responses during discussions. Just tap on a score as students give answers. Popsicle Sticks will display a running total for each student and automatically save the scores for future discussions. You can select students randomly (of course) or manually (by just tapping on a name). Save multiple discussions for various subjects, and easily export the scores to Excel or another application.\n\nWith this free version of Popsicle Sticks: Teacher Picks, you can input one class, randomly select up to 500 students, create 10 random lists, 5 random groupings, 5 scored discussions, 5 tournaments, and 5 Rad Roll Calls. If you find it helpful, you can upgrade to the full version, Popsicle Sticks Unlimited. With Popsicle Sticks Unlimited you'll get unlimited access to all the features.\n\nUse Popsicle Sticks: Teacher Picks as a student picker, grouper, scorer, and gamer!"

The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian, Japanese and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

      "label": "Join hundreds of thousands of families! \nAs adults, we've all dreamed of being able to easily learn a new language, but those of us who have tried know how complicated it can be. That's why we have developed a revolutionary method for children aged 3 to 12. Children have the brain plasticity to learn new languages far more easily than adults!\n\n====================\nWHY DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS LOVE THE HOLY OWLY METHOD?\nIt's not just an app: Holy Owly is the result of 3 years of research and development within a school, where teachers, linguist researchers and hundreds of children have participated in the development of the pedagogical method and unique content.\nOur commitment:\nOnly 5 minutes a day of learning: this format constitutes a daily ritual encouraging memory anchoring without over exposure to screens,\nChildren learn while having fun: thanks to our teaching method and the immersive adventure in which they participate, they learn 3 words or sentences 6 days a week on a theme from everyday life, \nChildren practice speaking: to learn a language you have to speak it! Our voice recognition system will allow children to practice on their own and improve their pronunciation. We make children proud to express themselves!\nOur content is curated for every age group during childhood, with a personalised course that adapts to each child's learning pace. Each year, children will be able to continue their adventure and continue to enrich their vocabulary and progress in oral expression.  \n\nThe Holy Owly method is organised in 7 stages: Discover, Repeat, Choose, Classify, Memorise, Play and Check. \n\n====================\nRECOMMENDED BY TEACHERS\nHoly Owly is the number one English application for children in France and is also recommended by teachers. Following numerous requests, we have adapted our methodology to schools in partnership with the publisher Bordas, and it is now used in several hundred classes in France! \n\n====================\nIn order to use all the functions of the application, you will have to choose a monthly or yearly subscription. You will have one week free before the first payment.\nTRY IT OUT WITH OUR FREE TRIAL WEEK\n\n====================\nThe content is 100% secure: without ads, children can learn safely.

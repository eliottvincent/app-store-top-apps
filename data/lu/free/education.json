The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer.

      "label": "Word Tag works\nGet ready to be outsmarted by your kids. This game will increase their vocabulary performance by 43% in just four weeks!\n\nIn 20 minutes of gameplay a day – with eight exposures to every new word over three weeks – you'll see your child's confidence soar and their schoolwork improve. While kids are focused on having fun and acing the game, they will be learning up to 1,000 new words a year, all personalized to their level. The learning happens almost invisibly, so they learn more because they are having fun (and it doesn’t feel like homework). And while they are busy getting all the fun rewards, you can track their advancement on a progress report showing all the pedagogical activities behind the chest of treasures your kid accumulates in the game.\n\nWith characters designed by Craig Kellman (Madagascar, Hotel Transylvania), developed by the brilliant designers of Subway Surfers, crafted on the foundations created by the award-winning team of Mrs Wordsmith, and backed by a stellar team of literacy experts, Word Tag will have a lasting impact in the education and entertainment of the whole family. \nOur unique pedagogical approach was developed and endorsed by Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\n\nHow does it work, you ask? \nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory.\nWe developed several mini-games, to be played in a specific order, carefully scaffolded, with each mini-game building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning.\n\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across four different game activities:\n\nWild Styling Syllables: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word.\n\nWild Styling Synonyms: It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\n\nContext Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\n\nPop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz.\n\nWord Tag uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\n\nThe words kids see are tailored to their needs, including:\n\nCreative writing and literature words\nTextbook words from the Lexile database\n\nUS exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\nUK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\nInspirational words\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\n\nFor more information, have a look through our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Try out free version of Robot School and get hooked into programming! \n\nR-obbie the Robot crashed his spaceship in a far away galaxy. R-obbie needs a lot of energy to get back to his planet. Drag and drop programming instructions to help him reach the fuel he needs to return home safely.\n\nRobot School offers a child-friendly way to learn procedures, loops and conditional instructions, while making programming fun and accessible, regardless of prior experience.\n\n-----\n\nKey Features:\n* 45 levels that teach real programming logic \n* Drag and drop instructions to control R-obbie and collect the fuel\n* New powers and achievements unlocked after completing each level\n* A preview of your code in Swift programming language\n* An easy way to share your code on Facebook\n* NO in-app purchases\n\nPSST... Robot School is a great logic game for grown ups too! \n\n-----\n\n\"In fifteen years we'll be teaching programming just like reading and writing... and wondering why we didn't do it sooner.\" \n-- Mark Zuckerberg\n\n\"Robot School is a great app for teaching coding to kids in a way that helps them visualize what is being taught.\"\n-- 148apps.com\n\n\"If you have been wondering how to help your kids learn how to code, Robot School is a great place to start. It’s suitable for ages 7+ who love to play LEGO and want to learn how to control their own robots. The game is an excellent playground for kids to practice their critical thinking and creative problem solving skills.\" \n-- Geeks With Juniors \n\n\"There’s a lot of buzz about children learning coding. Robot School is one of the apps trying to help. For age seven and up, it introduces coding logic across 45 levels of accessible, robot-guided puzzling.\"\n-- The Guardian\n\n\"Robot School, a game for kids 7 and up, looks like a fancy version of Light-Bot.\" \n-- Boing Boing\n\n\"I admire this app a great deal as it allows users the chance to drag and drop programming commands so children can spend their time focusing on the logic of how to move this robot about without having to memorize bits of code or struggling to avoid simple typos and other mistakes that will cause impasses and frustrations. With these commands laid out in front of users organized left to right, much like reading a book, the coding experience is eased for reluctant users who can truly visualize how these codes effect the movements of R-obbie. There is no time limit to these tasks, no score to beat, and no stars to collect, which I appreciate a great deal.\" \n-- AppReviewDaddy.com \n\n\"This cool educational app offers a series of challenges that kids can solve using programming elements, including functions like loops that are used in languages from BASIC to Java. The levels get progressively more complex as they introduce new variables and require more steps to reach the solution. You can even see how your code translates to Swift, an iOS and OS X programming language, based on the elements you’ve used.\"\n-- Cool Mom Tech \n\n\"We think the app is a great addition to support students from the age of 6+, as they embark on grasping the foundations of programming.\"\n-- UK Ed Chat"

      "label": "Tracing Projector is your personal portable drawing and composition tool.\n\nHaving Tracing Projector is like always having a sheet of tracing paper with you! Choose any image you'd like to draw, take a photo, or choose from hundreds of images supplied in the app; then look at your screen while you trace the image on paper!\n\n- Learn to Draw! Learn proportions and important lines by tracing photos of anything! Use several filters to enhance your photo, making it easier to trace.\n\n- Make real one-of-a-kind artwork you can hang on your wall! Send unique greetings on social media! Friends and family will love to see your animated drawings!\n\n- Show off your skills! Record a video while you draw and share it on your favorite social network. Your friends will be amazed! Choose from time-lapse and regular speeds, and include a narrative if you want to. \n\n- Great for face painting or artistic makeup!\n\n- Great for school projects! Need to draw an image from a book on a poster? Trace it!\n\n- Kick-start your painting or portrait! Transfer your idea from a photo to your drawing canvas to get the proportions right.\n\n- Match the Composition! Transfer your plan from a sketch to the scrapbook page or photo wall! \n\n- Challenge yourself to sketch the essence of the image before the timer runs out! Focus on composition and structure. Freehand the fine details afterward, or disable Quick Sketch and trace them directly. (Disabling requires a one-time purchase.)\n\nSeveral tools make it really easy to trace your image:\n\n- Light Table - lock your screen, turn up the brightness, and trace the image from your screen directly!\n\n- Handheld Mode -- On supported devices, Augmented Reality keeps your tracing image steady while you hold your device at a comfortable angle. (demo video https://youtu.be/YJeK5Sjdi1Q). Requires iOS 11.3 or later on iPhone 6s/6s Plus or iPad Pro and later. Works best on stable horizontal and vertical surfaces with good light and some visible surface detail.\n\n- Lock the camera focus to keep the image steady while you trace.\n\n- Lock the canvas area to keep your layout and alignment while you zoom in to get a close look at your work in progress.\n\n- Several Filter modes enhance your image, increasing contrast to give you a better result.\n\n- Use the flashlight to light up your drawing. (requires Full Version)\n\n- Use the selfie camera and draw on your face. (requires Full Version)\n\n\nOther features make it fun and easy to share your creations with your friends.\n\n- Video recording in Time Lapse mode to make things smaller and faster and cooler. You can enable normal-speed and audio on the Settings screen.\n\n- The recorded video or snapshot includes a small thumbnail of the tracing image (with an option to turn that off).\n\n- Your videos and snapshots are stored automatically and available to share later from within the app, the Files app, or iTunes.\n\n- Sharing your videos and photos is easy with a preview screen and saved photos/videos!\n\n- Interrupted while recording your drawing? No problem - Combine multiple videos to create a single video for sharing! Use the Edit feature on the Saved Files screen: select two movies and tap Join.\n\n\nTracing Projector is Enhanced For 3D Touch! Start right away from the camera or photo album from the home screen! Force-touch on the tracing image to peek at your progress while you draw!\n\n\nNotes:\n- For best results, stabilize your device above your drawing surface. A stack of books, drinking glass, or tripod works best.\n- The app requires access to your camera in order to present its overlay for drawing.\n- The app requires access to your photos in order to load an image to trace and to save the video of your drawing.\n- The app optionally uses your microphone when recording a video while you draw."

However, these are not the sort of standard tutorials that you find on the web. During the videos you will be set tasks to do in scratch and hopefully you will be able to complete them on your own. However don't worry the next video in each project will show you how to complete the task!!\n\nThese videos are really targeted at primary/elementary students although the content of the full app will go on to stretch and challenge even the most able of them with variables, cloning, broadcasting and many other features of Scratch. \n\nThere's even a quiz in the app so you can test your scratch knowledge too!!\n\nScratch really is a fantastic way into learning programming and coding and this app hopefully will be a great asset to get you going with it.\n\nThis is a big app of just under 100Mb, because there is so much material in it, even for a \"lite\" version. You will need to be hooked into your WiFi connection!!  \n\n*TEACHERS* the point of this app is that kids can use the iPad alongside the pc to build their games in Scratch. You can just sit back and relax without having to plan anything. Oh and there is enough material in the full version to keep your students busy for around 6 hours, even if they don't manage to have a go at the extension tasks that are identified for all 5 games!!"

It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

This advanced tool will immediately show and read the result using a natural, accent-free voice.\n\nFOR PROFESSIONALS:\nThe machine translation system has evolved over the years. Now it outperforms the average native speaker in many (but not all) of the languages in terms of grammar, wording and general style. You can use this capability - for example when dealing with outside customers. Many private and government institutions are already using this software.\n\nFOR TRAVELLERS: \nJust speak into your device. No training needed. Want to ask someone for directions? Read the restaurants menu? This is the go-to tool for getting around in any situation.\n\nFOR LANGUAGE LEARNERS:\nLook up vocabulary. Create your own sentences and check how their meaning changes when you rearrange the words. You can store phrases in a list for quick access and adjust the speed of the apps voice. This allows you to listen to unbiased, accent-free and correctly pronounced examples of your content.\n\nNote: This app needs an interet connection to translate. You can view and play back saved translatios without data sevices.\n\nNote: There are in app purchases which allow to buy additional features. A trial is available for free. You can always use the main translation features - even if you decide that you don't want a monthly self-renewing subscription after the free trial.\n\nSubscription terms:\nhttps://czokindustries.com/Translator/otherHosted/subscriptionTerms.pdf\n\nTerms of service and privacy policy: \nhttp://czokindustries.com/Translator/otherHosted/privacyPolicyTranslator.pdf"

      "label": "Learn French with free lessons daily. Let Mondly teach you the French language quickly and effectively. In just minutes you’ll start memorizing core French words, form sentences, learn to speak French phrases and take part in conversations. Fun French lessons improve your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation like no other language learning method. Beginner or advanced learner, traveler or business professional with a tight schedule?\n\nExplore language exercises for reading, listening, writing and speaking enhanced with a dictionary, verb conjugator and state-of-the-art speech recognition technology - you’ll feel like having your own French language tutor in your pocket.\nDownload the language learning pill today and enjoy the benefits of learning a new language for life.\n\n▶ The secret path to language learning\nRemember the French language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of French grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.\nMondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.\n\nHere are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\n• Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. Learn the right French pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\n\n• State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your French words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak French clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.\n\n• Useful phrases for real situations. Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning French. Mondly teaches you French vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.\n\n• Learn conversational French. Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core French vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak French clearly.\n\n• Advanced Statistics. The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.\n\n• The Leaderboard. See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.\n\nPLEASE NOTE\n\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to all of this app’s courses and features.\n\nSubscription options:\n- One-monthly subscription for $US9.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n- One-yearly subscription for $US47.99 (or the equivalent in local currency), automatically renewed until canceled.\n\nYour subscription will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current payment period.\n\nYour iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within the 24-hour period prior to the end of the current payment period unless you change your subscription preferences in your Account Settings.\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\nAny unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\nYou can manage your subscriptions through your Account Settings after purchase.\n\nWhen a subscription is canceled, access to the app’s courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nPrivacy Policy: www.mondly.com/privacy\nTerms: www.mondly.com/terms\n\nWe welcome your feedback and suggestions at: ios[at]mondly[dot]com\n\nBefore you know it, at the end of these French lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language."

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "***** 5/5 stars  EducationalAppStore.com *****\nLetraKid is an educational game addressed to children (4-8 years old) that can help them to learn pre-cursive and print block handwriting correctly, while having fun when doing so!\n\nWHAT KIDS CAN LEARN FROM THIS GAME\n\n• Recognize letter shapes and perfect alphabet pronunciation\n• The correct letter formation: start, checkpoints, strokes direction, order etc. Difficulty Levels 1 and 2 with assisted writing are designed to focus on the letter formation.\n• Develop fine motor skills for handwriting activity. Difficulty Levels 3 to 5 with freehand writing activities will focus on this improvement to help maximize confidence and form when writing.\n• Playing with a stylus pen will also help to improve standard pencil grasp. Any stylus compatible with the device will work.\n\nMAIN FEATURES\n\n• 16 languages with full support for interface, human native voices for letter/numbers pronunciation and full official alphabets. (ENGLISH, ESPAÑOL, FRANÇAIS, DEUTSCH, ITALIANO, PORTUGUÊS, NEDERLANDS, SVENSKA, NORSK, DANSK, SUOMI, ROMÂNĂ, JĘZYK POLSKI, TÜRKÇE, BAHASA INDONESIA and BAHASA MELAYU)\n• 3 popular letter formation rules that will provide flexibility for picking the right stroke order and direction for the child. Vital for improving grasp on key terms and rulings within handwriting.\n• Makes use of the 10 most popular fonts in classes all over the world for learning pre cursive and print block handwriting: ZB style, HWT style, DN style, German(Hamburg) style, Euro Latino, NSW, Victoria, KIWI etc.\n• Full support for both Left and Right handwriting rules.\n• 5 difficulty levels with AUTO and LOCK settings, ranging from assisted writing for beginners, up to real freehand writing with minimal support and strict evaluation.\n• 4 set of glyphs: ABC (full alphabet for upper case letters), abc (full alphabet for lower case letters), 123 (numbers from 0 to 9) and a special set of signs for funny exercises.\n• 5 progression levels, color coded for each glyph that allows parents and teachers an instant evaluation of the progression and most exercised letters at the alphabet level.\n• 16 funny sticker rewards that will unlock after progression milestones are reached. Also, their drawing rules after each completed progression at Alphabet/glyph list level.\n• 3 profile slots with 50 funny avatars and name customization that will save independently the settings and the progression.\n• Full support for both Landscape and Portrait orientations.\n\nDownload now this free version and you can check yourself these features on a limited list of letters and numbers.\n\nGREAT IN THE CLASSROOM!\n\nWith a unique and real-time feedback feature as well as complex tracing evaluation algorithms, LetraKid is not just another tracing app.\n\nThis is a new approach, focused on creating a fun game by utilizing handwriting mechanics itself. This avoids using distracting random rewards or secondary game mechanics that can break and confuse the learning process, optimizing learning progress and educational appeal to children.\n\nThe real time feedback will give both audio and graphic clues about the quality of the tracing and will adjust with difficulty level.\nOur tracing evaluation algorithms allow for an accurate and fun reward, using a 5 star rating for each exercise. This engages and motivates the kids to progress and to strive for more.\n\nDESIGNED for KIDS\n\n• No ads or irritating pop-ups.\n• No collection of personal data\n• Game settings are by default behind a parental gate. This can be disabled, but ensures a child to work with a certain font, formation rule, difficulty level and various other features for total specification to their needs.\n• External links are protected by a permanent parental gate.\n\nGot any ideas for improving LetraKid? Then please send us your feedback and requests."

Added bonus is that it comes with a community of leaders I can discuss related-topics with, and get specific advice.\" - Nader Alexan, CTO @ Airteam\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH user for months now, and there aren't many services that I'm this excited about! I genuinely believe it can be the lever to catapult your career or business - especially if you don't have time to read all the latest management books and HBR articles, but you still need to lead people in your work.\" - Srđan Stanić, Software Engineer at Gravitus\n\n\"I've been a BUNCH beta tester since the very beginning. Over the last year I've watched the app and the content grow into a truly meaningful product experience. Leaders at all levels can benefit from adopting the 2-minute daily habit. I love binging on tips in my free time, and often share content with my team.\" - Merissa Silk, Head of Product @ fundingport\n\n\"I almost dislike how popular BUNCH is becoming because as a beta user, it always felt like my own personal secret weapon! The coach makes it easy to have a moment of reflection each day, and having met the team behind it, I know they’re serious about their mission and vision to enable anyone to be a better leader.\" - Javier Gutiérrez Boronat, Agile Coach & Entrepreneurship Facilitator\n\n“Bunch gave me a template for how to call out team members who’ve gone above and beyond. The team loves it, and It’s really helped them gain a sense of what excellence looks like in their role.” - Cynthia Gordon, Customer Experience Leader @ [monday.com](http://monday.com/)\n\nReady to take the lead?

      "label": "From the award-winning team at Mrs Wordsmith comes Word Tag: A brand new, epic word game so engaging, your child won’t want to stop learning!\n\n\r\nCombining cutting-edge design, educational research and compelling gameplay, Word Tag will help your child improve their vocabulary and become a confident reader in just 20 minutes per day. Using a tried-and-tested framework, Word Tag uses fun minigames to give kids the eight exposures they need to retain vocabulary, in bite-sized chunks, over the course of three weeks. \r\n\r\nWe collaborated with the team behind the wildly fun Subway Surfers game to make vocabulary learning into just as exciting a ride. \r\n\r\nBut though it might look like play, it’s actually learning! We brought in literacy experts to help produce our unique pedagogical approach, including Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory. \r\n\r\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across three different games: \r\n\r\n-Wild Styling: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word. It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\r\n-Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\r\n-Pop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz!\r\n\r\nThe order of the minigames in Word Tag is carefully scaffolded, with each minigame building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning. \r\n\r\nThe truth is that you don’t have to choose between game-first design and educational value. The same elements that make sure kids want to play also make sure that they learn more effectively. \r\n\r\n_______________________\r\n\r\nWhat vocabulary will kids see in Word Tag? Word lists are tailored to their needs, including:\r\n-Creative writing and literature words\r\n-Textbook words from the Lexile database\r\n-US exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\r\n-UK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\r\n-Inspirational words\r\n-STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\r\n\r\nThe game uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nDON’T WORRY:\r\n-No third-party ads, no in-app purchases\r\n-Suitable for ages 7-13\n\nFor more details please read our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

      "label": "Tracing Projector is your personal portable drawing and composition tool.\n\nHaving Tracing Projector is like always having a sheet of tracing paper with you! Choose any image you'd like to draw, take a photo, or choose from hundreds of images supplied in the app; then look at your screen while you trace the image on paper!\n\n- Learn to Draw! Learn proportions and important lines by tracing photos of anything! Use several filters to enhance your photo, making it easier to trace.\n\n- Make real one-of-a-kind artwork you can hang on your wall! Send unique greetings on social media! Friends and family will love to see your animated drawings!\n\n- Show off your skills! Record a video while you draw and share it on your favorite social network. Your friends will be amazed! Choose from time-lapse and regular speeds, and include a narrative if you want to. \n\n- Great for face painting or artistic makeup!\n\n- Great for school projects! Need to draw an image from a book on a poster? Trace it!\n\n- Kick-start your painting or portrait! Transfer your idea from a photo to your drawing canvas to get the proportions right.\n\n- Match the Composition! Transfer your plan from a sketch to the scrapbook page or photo wall! \n\n- Challenge yourself to sketch the essence of the image before the timer runs out! Focus on composition and structure. Freehand the fine details afterward, or disable Quick Sketch and trace them directly. (Disabling requires a one-time purchase.)\n\nSeveral tools make it really easy to trace your image:\n\n- Light Table - lock your screen, turn up the brightness, and trace the image from your screen directly!\n\n- Handheld Mode -- On supported devices, Augmented Reality keeps your tracing image steady while you hold your device at a comfortable angle. (demo video https://youtu.be/YJeK5Sjdi1Q). Requires iOS 11.3 or later on iPhone 6s/6s Plus or iPad Pro and later. Works best on stable horizontal and vertical surfaces with good light and some visible surface detail.\n\n- Lock the camera focus to keep the image steady while you trace.\n\n- Lock the canvas area to keep your layout and alignment while you zoom in to get a close look at your work in progress.\n\n- Several Filter modes enhance your image, increasing contrast to give you a better result.\n\n- Use the flashlight to light up your drawing. (requires Full Version)\n\n- Use the selfie camera and draw on your face. (requires Full Version)\n\n\nOther features make it fun and easy to share your creations with your friends.\n\n- Video recording in Time Lapse mode to make things smaller and faster and cooler. You can enable normal-speed and audio on the Settings screen.\n\n- The recorded video or snapshot includes a small thumbnail of the tracing image (with an option to turn that off).\n\n- Your videos and snapshots are stored automatically and available to share later from within the app, the Files app, or iTunes.\n\n- Sharing your videos and photos is easy with a preview screen and saved photos/videos!\n\n- Interrupted while recording your drawing? No problem - Combine multiple videos to create a single video for sharing! Use the Edit feature on the Saved Files screen: select two movies and tap Join.\n\n\nTracing Projector is Enhanced For 3D Touch! Start right away from the camera or photo album from the home screen! Force-touch on the tracing image to peek at your progress while you draw!\n\n\nNotes:\n- For best results, stabilize your device above your drawing surface. A stack of books, drinking glass, or tripod works best.\n- The app requires access to your camera in order to present its overlay for drawing.\n- The app requires access to your photos in order to load an image to trace and to save the video of your drawing.\n- The app optionally uses your microphone when recording a video while you draw."

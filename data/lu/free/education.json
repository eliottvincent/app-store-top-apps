From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "EDURINO führt Kinder im Alter von 4-8 Jahren spielerisch und verantwortungsbewusst an digitale Medien heran. In den Lernspielen werden Schul- und Zukunftskompetenzen gefördert.\n\nKinder begeben sich je nach gewähltem Lerninhalt gemeinsam mit unterschiedlichen Spielfiguren auf Lernreisen in unbekannte Welten. Sie befreien diese jeweils durch über 20 Lernspiele von den kleinen, süßen Chaosmonstern. In der „Welt der Worte“ unterstützen sie beispielsweise die Füchsin Mika darin, Ordnung zu schaffen und erlernen dabei Grundkenntnisse für das Lesen und Schreiben. Die Spiele sind auch nach der Freischaltung aller Lerninhalte beliebig oft wiederholbar und werden in Updates zusätzlich durch kleinere Spiele ergänzt. \n \nEDURINO wird gemeinsam mit PädagogInnen und LogopädInnen entwickelt und wöchentlich in unseren Partnerkindergärten getestet. Die App ist werbefrei, ohne In-App-Käufe und offline spielbar. Durch einen gesicherten Elternbereich, in dem die Bildschirmzeit angepasst und der Spielstand eingesehen werden kann, gibt die App Kindern die Möglichkeit, selbstständig zu spielen und zu lernen.\n \n \nWie funktioniert Edurino?\n \nDie EDURINO Lernapp funktioniert mit haptischen Spielfiguren und einem mit ErgotherapeutInnen entwickelten Dreikantstift. Die EDURINO Produkte können auf www.edurino.com erworben werden.\n \nDie Spielfiguren sind der Schlüssel zur digitalen Welt. Mit dem Aufdrücken der Spielfigur auf ein Smartphone oder Tablet werden die gewünschten Lernspiele, wie z.B. Erstes Lesen & Schreiben, Zahlen & Mengen oder Erstes Englisch in der EDURINO App freigeschaltet. \n \nDer ergonomische Dreikantstift unterstützt Links- und RechtshänderInnen bei der Entwicklung einer lockeren Stifthaltung und trainiert in jeder Lernreise die Schreibmotorik durch abwechslungsreiche Übungen.\n \n \nWeitere Informationen\n \nhttps://www.edurino.com/\nhttps://edurino.com/policies/privacy-policy\nhttps://edurino.com/policies/terms-of-service"

      "label": "Word Tag works\nGet ready to be outsmarted by your kids. This game will increase their vocabulary performance by 43% in just four weeks!\n\nIn 20 minutes of gameplay a day – with eight exposures to every new word over three weeks – you'll see your child's confidence soar and their schoolwork improve. While kids are focused on having fun and acing the game, they will be learning up to 1,000 new words a year, all personalized to their level. The learning happens almost invisibly, so they learn more because they are having fun (and it doesn’t feel like homework). And while they are busy getting all the fun rewards, you can track their advancement on a progress report showing all the pedagogical activities behind the chest of treasures your kid accumulates in the game.\n\nWith characters designed by Craig Kellman (Madagascar, Hotel Transylvania), developed by the brilliant designers of Subway Surfers, crafted on the foundations created by the award-winning team of Mrs Wordsmith, and backed by a stellar team of literacy experts, Word Tag will have a lasting impact in the education and entertainment of the whole family. \nOur unique pedagogical approach was developed and endorsed by Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\n\nHow does it work, you ask? \nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory.\nWe developed several mini-games, to be played in a specific order, carefully scaffolded, with each mini-game building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning.\n\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across four different game activities:\n\nWild Styling Syllables: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word.\n\nWild Styling Synonyms: It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\n\nContext Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\n\nPop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz.\n\nWord Tag uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\n\nThe words kids see are tailored to their needs, including:\n\nCreative writing and literature words\nTextbook words from the Lexile database\n\nUS exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\nUK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\nInspirational words\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\n\nFor more information, have a look through our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture. In contrast to a geo-cache or a scavenger hunt Actionbound requires the players to create their own content."

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

In addition to audio tours and atmospheric audio walks through downtown Weimar and the museums and historical parks of the Klassik Stiftung Weimar, the app offers numerous multimedia information and tours on the topics of Weimar classicism, modernism and historical parks.\n\nYou can use an interactive map to explore the language area of the city of Weimar, the Park on the Ilm and the Belvedere Castle Park individually for yourself. With activated GPS, you can display all audio stops in the immediate vicinity and go on a discovery tour using a filterable recommendation system. Are you looking for the nearest WiFi hotspot or museum shop? No problem - in our legend you can display all service information about your visit.\n\nDiscover our game with AR functions in the Park on the Ilm and in the Nietzsche Archive. Packed in various small puzzles, the individual locations can be explored from a new perspective. Once all the puzzles have been solved, you can continue to care for the seeds you collected in the game. In the Herzogin Anna Amalia Bibliothek, an AR application gives you the opportunity to take books off the shelves and take a look at the treasures of the famous library. There is also a 3D application for the Nietzsche Archive, with which Nietzsche's death room can be explored virtually.\n\nThe app helps you prepare for and follow up your visit with in-depth information, interviews with our curators, video features of the artists and gardeners as well as event recommendations.\n\nThe featured tours allow you to immerse yourself in our exhibitions and parks and are accompanied by handicap accessible services and programmes for children. The app is designed to regularly update new content so that it can better cater to your needs. \n\nWe look forward to your feedback and suggestions!"

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Dive into the heart of Bois Jacques on a unique immersive journey with the Easy Company thanks to Overlap Reality®, a technology developed by SkyBoy that enhances the effects of augmented reality.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Bois Jacques, an historic site of the Battle of the Ardennes, was the scene of terrible battles between the American and German armies.\n\nIn December, 1944, Bastogne is situated on the route of the German Fifth Armoured Division. The Germans have a very clear plan, which involves taking the important crossroads that form Bastogne as quickly as possible and heading towards the river Meuse: the Panzer Lehr Division 130 must capture the town by surprise, while the Panzer Division 2 must bypass it and attack the Meuse. Meanwhile, the Volks-Grenadiere-Division 26 must attack the resistance pocket.\n\nBut the Americans on the ground and the reinforcements hastily sent in in trucks resist to defend the city! And on December 19, the 101st American Airborne Division comes to the rescue. However, The GIs are quickly surrounded.\n\nIt is in this context that, on December 20, 1944, the 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Regiment, of which the famous Easy Company is a member (“Band of Brothers”), takes up position in Bois Jacques. It will remain there until the beginning of January, 1945, before giving way to other units of the 101st Airborne Division.\n\nAfter fierce resistance to German attacks, the time comes for the American counter-attack in early January, 1945. In mid-January, the German army is still resisting fiercely but is seriously weakened: its supply is becoming increasingly complicated and its tanks run out of fuel. On January 28, 1945, the Battle of the Ardennes comes to an end. Its consequences prove decisive for the continuation of the conflict, and deal a fatal blow to Adolf Hitler’s ambitions.\n\nAware of the exceptional heritage character and historical value of this site, the City of Bastogne, IDELUX and INTERREG wished to promote it.\n\nUsing a dedicated mobile application, this particular digital project offers visitors of Bois Jacques the chance to be plunged into a series of six immersive, 360°, geo-localised videos, each lasting two to three minutes. Each audiovisual work, a true historical re-enactment, follows soldiers who belong to one of the Easy Company’s divisions, recounting a scene from their daily life of war, each spot being about a particular day and event.\n\nBenjamin Brillaud, alias NOTA BENE, is the red thread of the journey but knows to regularly disappear so as to allow the spectator to enter into the heart of history, inviting them to put themselves in the soldiers' shoes.\n\nThis mobile application is funded by the INTERREG V A GRANDE REGION programme as part of the “Land of Memory” project. It is produced by SKY BOY on behalf of IDELUX Public Projects.\n\nThe application is available in French, English, Dutch and German.\n\nHow does it work?\n 1/ Meet at Bois Jacques\n 2/ Scan the QR code or connect to the \"Bois Jacques\" Wi-Fi\n 3/ Download the application in the app-store of your smartphone\n 4/ Launch the application to load the content\n 5/ Place yourself on one of the points materialized by a target\n 6/ At each point of interest, aim at the target and click on the screen to start the video"

Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian, Japanese and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

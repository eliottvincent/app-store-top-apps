      "label": "iNaturalist is a social network for sharing biodiversity information to help each other learn about nature. The primary goal is to connect people to nature, and the secondary goal is to generate scientifically valuable biodiversity data from these personal encounters. \n\niNaturalist helps you identify plants and animals with visually similar suggestions and verification by dedicated contributors. Get connected with a community of over a million scientists and naturalists who can help you learn more about nature! By recording and sharing your observations, you'll create research-quality data for scientists working to better understand and protect nature. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n• Identification suggestions: Take or import a photo and view the top 10 most visually similar species matches and tap through to get more information. You can view these suggestions even before creating an account.\n• Feedback from our community: Create an account to share your observations and start a conversation about what you saw. Can’t identify the organism? Start with a broad identification like “plants” or “fungi” so others with more expertise can find it and refine the identification. \n• Keep a record of all living things: Build your life list by posting to iNaturalist. Where, when, and what you saw is the basis of each observation you create.\n• Grounded in science: Every identification is connected to the tree of life, which means you can search for broad classifications like “Ferns” or “Fungi” as well as species-level identifications like “Humpback Whale” (and everything in between). \n• Advancing science & conservation: Millions of observations created and identified by the iNaturalist community are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility where they are used to advance scientific understanding of biodiversity through open data and open science. \n• Enabling citizen science and community science: Join any of the tens of thousands of projects around the world on iNaturalist to draw attention to and collect data about particular species or places.\n• Not-for-profit: iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society, both 501(c)3 nonprofits in the United States. iNaturalist is free for anyone to use thanks to the generous support of many organizations and individuals. Thank you!\n• No hidden charges: This app is truly free because we believe nature is for everyone.\n• Best for wild plants and animals: The iNaturalist community is better at identifying wild plants and animals than those in gardens or horticulture. Get outside and find what’s wild!\n• Control how your location is shared: Set the privacy to obscured (only general location is shared) or private (no location is shared at all, but much harder for others to help identify). The locations of species at risk from disturbance are automatically obscured.\n• More than a mobile app: iNaturalist has even more extensive features and tools for learning and exploration. Get the full experience at inaturalist.org!\n• 35+ languages: iNaturalist has been translated into dozens of languages thanks to multilingual enthusiasts who want to see the community grow.\n• A global network: iNaturalist is used in every country on earth! In many countries, we have formal agreements with local organizations to promote iNaturalist. Use this app for contributing to all iNaturalist Network sites, including Naturalista (Mexico and Colombia), iNaturalist.NZ (New Zealand), iNaturalist.ca (Canada), Biodiversity4All (Portugal), iNaturalistAU (Australia), iNaturalistPa (Panama), iNaturalistEc (Ecuador), ArgentiNat (Argentina), iNaturalistil (Israel), and iNaturalistFi (Suomi/Finland)."

Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture. In contrast to a geo-cache or a scavenger hunt Actionbound requires the players to create their own content."

Das Ziel ist, über Suizidgedanken, Suizide und ihre Folgen zu informieren, Ressourcen und Werkzeuge der situativen Bewältigung zur Verfügung zu stellen. \r\n\r\nZu allen Facetten rund ums Thema Suizid finden Nutzer der APP Mädchen und Jungen, Frauen und Männer Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe, wertvolles Wissen und Unterstützung in akuten Krisensituationen:\r\n\r\n• Im roten Bereich der App finden sich Adressen von Online-Beratungen und telefonischer Hilfe, Beratungsstellen und Selbsthilfegruppen.\r\n\r\n• Im gelben Bereich finden Suizidgefährdete Informationen, Hilfsangebote und Möglichkeiten zur Selbsteinschätzung und zur Selbstbeobachtung. Im „Notfallkoffer“ finden sie Hilfestellungen zu Strategien, wie sie akute Krisen bewältigen können.\r\n\r\nIn einer Art „Stimmungsbarometer“ können Betroffene ihre Gedanken und ihre Gefühle in den Lebensbereichen Leistung/Arbeit, Beziehung/Kontakt, Geist/Werte und Körper/Sinne über einen längeren Zeitraum beobachten und in einer Grafik auswerten. Diese kann als PDF exportiert werden und z.B. in der Therapie oder Beratung genutzt werden. Damit kann die App eine wertvolle Hilfe für die Kooperation zwischen Unterstützern und Betroffenen sein. \r\n\r\n• Der grüne Bereich wendet sich an Angehörige, Freundinnen und Freunde. Für die meisten ist es wichtig, ihr Wissen zu stärken, weil sie unsicher sind, wie sie sich verhalten sollen. Welche Signale kann ich wahrnehmen, wie ist die Suizidgefährdung einzuschätzen, welche Möglichkeiten der Prävention gibt es, was ist zu tun? Zugleich finden sich hier Anleitungen zur Selbstfürsorge.\r\n\r\nDer violette Bereich wendet sich an Hinterbliebene, die jemanden durch Suizid verloren haben. Wie gehe ich mit einer solchen Situation um? Wie bewältige ich meine Gefühle? Was kann mir jetzt helfen und mich stabilisieren. Für diese Fragen gibt es viel Information und Unterstützung.\r\n\r\nDie App ist kostenfrei und gewährleistet absolute Vertraulichkeit, da grundsätzlich keine persönlichen Daten übermittelt werden. Ausnahme: Der User wählt bewusst und aktiv die PDF-Exportfunktion, um selektiv Inhalte mit jemandem zu teilen."

That's why we have developed a revolutionary method for children aged 3 to 12. Children have the brain plasticity to learn new languages far more easily than adults!\n\n====================\nWHY DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS LOVE THE HOLY OWLY METHOD?\nIt's not just an app: Holy Owly is the result of 3 years of research and development within a school, where teachers, linguist researchers and hundreds of children have participated in the development of the pedagogical method and unique content.\nOur commitment:\nOnly 5 minutes a day of learning: this format constitutes a daily ritual encouraging memory anchoring without over exposure to screens,\nChildren learn while having fun: thanks to our teaching method and the immersive adventure in which they participate, they learn 3 words or sentences 6 days a week on a theme from everyday life, \nChildren practice speaking: to learn a language you have to speak it! Our voice recognition system will allow children to practice on their own and improve their pronunciation. We make children proud to express themselves!\nOur content is curated for every age group during childhood, with a personalised course that adapts to each child's learning pace. Each year, children will be able to continue their adventure and continue to enrich their vocabulary and progress in oral expression.  \n\nThe Holy Owly method is organised in 7 stages: Discover, Repeat, Choose, Classify, Memorise, Play and Check. \n\n====================\nRECOMMENDED BY TEACHERS\nHoly Owly is the number one English application for children in France and is also recommended by teachers. Following numerous requests, we have adapted our methodology to schools in partnership with the publisher Bordas, and it is now used in several hundred classes in France! \n\n====================\nIn order to use all the functions of the application, you will have to choose a monthly or yearly subscription. You will have one week free before the first payment.\nTRY IT OUT WITH OUR FREE TRIAL WEEK\n\n====================\nThe content is 100% secure: without ads, children can learn safely.

While kids are focused on having fun and acing the game, they will be learning up to 1,000 new words a year, all personalized to their level. The learning happens almost invisibly, so they learn more because they are having fun (and it doesn’t feel like homework). And while they are busy getting all the fun rewards, you can track their advancement on a progress report showing all the pedagogical activities behind the chest of treasures your kid accumulates in the game.\n\nWith characters designed by Craig Kellman (Madagascar, Hotel Transylvania), developed by the brilliant designers of Subway Surfers, crafted on the foundations created by the award-winning team of Mrs Wordsmith, and backed by a stellar team of literacy experts, Word Tag will have a lasting impact in the education and entertainment of the whole family. \nOur unique pedagogical approach was developed and endorsed by Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\n\nHow does it work, you ask? \nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory.\nWe developed several mini-games, to be played in a specific order, carefully scaffolded, with each mini-game building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning.\n\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across four different game activities:\n\nWild Styling Syllables: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word.\n\nWild Styling Synonyms: It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\n\nContext Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\n\nPop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz.\n\nWord Tag uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\n\nThe words kids see are tailored to their needs, including:\n\nCreative writing and literature words\nTextbook words from the Lexile database\n\nUS exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\nUK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\nInspirational words\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\n\nFor more information, have a look through our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

      "label": "Mussila is an award-winning music learning app for children. It allows kids to explore the world of music on their own and gives them the opportunity to gain knowledge without continuous external help.\n\nThe app provides hours of musical lessons, games, and challenges, carefully crafted by musical experts and educators, designed to provide a joyful experience. Mussila is perfect for beginners.\n\n“Magically, kids intuitively pick up on the basic principles associated with music and have a blast doing so!” With the Mussila subscription, your child will gain a solid musical foundation that lasts a lifetime.\n\nHow the app works: You can choose between four learning paths; Learn, Play, Create & Practice.\n\nThe Learning Path:\n\n- Progress through the fundamentals of music theory like learning to identify notes, tempos, and how to read sheet music.\n- Develop a sense of rhythm and timing through games with recognizable songs.\n- Identify different instruments by sound through games like “Memory” and more.\n\nThe Play Path:\n\n- Learn to play the piano! You can do so on your mobile device or use a keyboard at home through the app if you have one.\n- Play along to familiar songs like Happy Birthday, Mary Had a Little Lamb, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Row, Row, Row Your Boat, and more!\n- Graduate to more advanced pieces from Swan Lake and The Magic Flute and eventually tackle the masters like Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart.\n\nRegardless of where your child is on the Mussila learning path, you can practice and play along with them. No music experience is necessary!\n\nThe Create Path:\n\n- Music Machine allows children to explore different sounds and colors and create their own songs.\n- Mussila DJ encourages the player to create their own musical soundscape and remix existing songs.\n- Mussila Planets, it’s an arcade game on its own where kids can follow the rhythm of songs and practice their ear for music.\n\nThe Practice Path:\n\n- This path is good for teachers and parents if they want to concentrate on one subject in the learning. Here you'll be able to focus on: instruments, rhythm, or melody.\n\nFor optimal user experience, we recommend using headphones when playing the game or turning your speaker volume up.\n\n**Awards & Recognitions:**\n\n-Certified Education Quality by Education Alliance Finland\n\n-Winner of the Mom's Choice Award 2021\n\n-Top Ten EdTech Startup in Europe in 2020 by Education Technology Insight \n\n-Winner of the Academic Choice Award 2020\n-Winner of the Nordic EdTech Awards 2019\n-Winner of the Parents´Choice Award 2019\n-Winner of the German Pedagogical Media Award 2018\n-Creative Business Cup - Global Finalist 2018\n-Best app for kids 2020- Educational App Store\n-Best app for parents 2019- Educational App Store\n-Best App for teachers 2019 - Educational App Store\n\n**Subscription**\n\nMussila offers three types of subscriptions:\n\n- Monthly Premium Subscription\n- Mussila Premium Trimonthly Subscription\n- Mussila Premium Yearly Subscription\n\n7-day free trial!

The Scratch name and Scratch cat are trademarks of MIT.\n\n**NOW A TOP 20 EDUCATIONAL APP IN OVER 40 COUNTRIES****\n\n\"Tutorials for Scratch Lite\" brings you 3 sets of video tutorials to get you going making your very first activity and game in the new version of Scratch 2.0. However, these are not the sort of standard tutorials that you find on the web. During the videos you will be set tasks to do in scratch and hopefully you will be able to complete them on your own. However don't worry the next video in each project will show you how to complete the task!!\n\nThese videos are really targeted at primary/elementary students although the content of the full app will go on to stretch and challenge even the most able of them with variables, cloning, broadcasting and many other features of Scratch. \n\nThere's even a quiz in the app so you can test your scratch knowledge too!!\n\nScratch really is a fantastic way into learning programming and coding and this app hopefully will be a great asset to get you going with it.\n\nThis is a big app of just under 100Mb, because there is so much material in it, even for a \"lite\" version. You will need to be hooked into your WiFi connection!!  \n\n*TEACHERS* the point of this app is that kids can use the iPad alongside the pc to build their games in Scratch. You can just sit back and relax without having to plan anything. Oh and there is enough material in the full version to keep your students busy for around 6 hours, even if they don't manage to have a go at the extension tasks that are identified for all 5 games!!"

      "label": "Learning a language can be an experience that transforms your life. Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n• 2019 PCMag Editors’ Choice\n• 2019 Tabby Awards Winner\n• 2019 Best Mobile App Awards: Best Designed App and Best Overall App\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next.

Flip between languages as often as you’d like and enjoy the freedom to get seriously curious. To access, simply select Unlimited Languages when you subscribe. \n\n\nChoose from 24 languages: \nArabic, Chinese (Mandarin), Dutch, English (American or British), Filipino (Tagalog), French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin American or Spain), Swedish, Turkish, or Vietnamese. \n\n\n\nSelect a subscription: \nWe offer 3 and 12-month subscriptions—as well as a Lifetime option. \n\n\n\nSubscription Details:\n• Get full access to all lessons, stories, and audio companion when you subscribe to Rosetta Stone. \n• Payment will be charged to your Apple ID. \n• Your account will be auto-renewed 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• Manage or cancel your subscription from your App Store User Settings at any time after purchasing.

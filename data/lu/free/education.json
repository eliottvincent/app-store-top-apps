The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian, Japanese and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Dive into the heart of Bois Jacques on a unique immersive journey with the Easy Company thanks to Overlap Reality®, a technology developed by SkyBoy that enhances the effects of augmented reality.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Bois Jacques, an historic site of the Battle of the Ardennes, was the scene of terrible battles between the American and German armies.\n\nIn December, 1944, Bastogne is situated on the route of the German Fifth Armoured Division. The Germans have a very clear plan, which involves taking the important crossroads that form Bastogne as quickly as possible and heading towards the river Meuse: the Panzer Lehr Division 130 must capture the town by surprise, while the Panzer Division 2 must bypass it and attack the Meuse. Meanwhile, the Volks-Grenadiere-Division 26 must attack the resistance pocket.\n\nBut the Americans on the ground and the reinforcements hastily sent in in trucks resist to defend the city! And on December 19, the 101st American Airborne Division comes to the rescue. However, The GIs are quickly surrounded.\n\nIt is in this context that, on December 20, 1944, the 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Regiment, of which the famous Easy Company is a member (“Band of Brothers”), takes up position in Bois Jacques. It will remain there until the beginning of January, 1945, before giving way to other units of the 101st Airborne Division.\n\nAfter fierce resistance to German attacks, the time comes for the American counter-attack in early January, 1945. In mid-January, the German army is still resisting fiercely but is seriously weakened: its supply is becoming increasingly complicated and its tanks run out of fuel. On January 28, 1945, the Battle of the Ardennes comes to an end. Its consequences prove decisive for the continuation of the conflict, and deal a fatal blow to Adolf Hitler’s ambitions.\n\nAware of the exceptional heritage character and historical value of this site, the City of Bastogne, IDELUX and INTERREG wished to promote it.\n\nUsing a dedicated mobile application, this particular digital project offers visitors of Bois Jacques the chance to be plunged into a series of six immersive, 360°, geo-localised videos, each lasting two to three minutes. Each audiovisual work, a true historical re-enactment, follows soldiers who belong to one of the Easy Company’s divisions, recounting a scene from their daily life of war, each spot being about a particular day and event.\n\nBenjamin Brillaud, alias NOTA BENE, is the red thread of the journey but knows to regularly disappear so as to allow the spectator to enter into the heart of history, inviting them to put themselves in the soldiers' shoes.\n\nThis mobile application is funded by the INTERREG V A GRANDE REGION programme as part of the “Land of Memory” project. It is produced by SKY BOY on behalf of IDELUX Public Projects.\n\nThe application is available in French, English, Dutch and German.\n\nHow does it work?\n 1/ Meet at Bois Jacques\n 2/ Scan the QR code or connect to the \"Bois Jacques\" Wi-Fi\n 3/ Download the application in the app-store of your smartphone\n 4/ Launch the application to load the content\n 5/ Place yourself on one of the points materialized by a target\n 6/ At each point of interest, aim at the target and click on the screen to start the video"

      "label": "The app is available in many different languages!\nMathCityMap is based on the math trail idea introduced in Melbourne, Australia in 1984 (that time on paper only). Since that time lots of mathematicians and math educators have picked up this fascinating idea. Just like us. Additionally we set a new approach to this project using mobile technology.\n\nThe MathCityMap App for smartphones is developed for students who would like to walk a math trail during school lessons or even for interested users who want to explore their surroundings with a mathematical point of view. The app leads the user via GPS to the mathematical tasks of a chosen math trail and gives automaticaly feedback on the answers of the user. In addition the app also provides hints in case someone is lost on a certain problem.\n\nThe MathCityMap web portal is for teachers and creative minds who want to create tasks and trails. Good tasks will be made public and can be used by everyone to combine them with their own tasks for a personal math trail. Furthermore the public tasks can inspire users for their own tasks. All created math trails can be solved by walking with a smartphone or can be printed out from an automatically generated PDF file. The web portal also provides tutorials how to get started, publications in the field of math trails and general informations about doing mathematics outdoors."

That's why we have developed a revolutionary method for children aged 3 to 12. Children have the brain plasticity to learn new languages far more easily than adults!\n\n====================\nWHY DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS LOVE THE HOLY OWLY METHOD?\nIt's not just an app: Holy Owly is the result of 3 years of research and development within a school, where teachers, linguist researchers and hundreds of children have participated in the development of the pedagogical method and unique content.\nOur commitment:\nOnly 5 minutes a day of learning: this format constitutes a daily ritual encouraging memory anchoring without over exposure to screens,\nChildren learn while having fun: thanks to our teaching method and the immersive adventure in which they participate, they learn 3 words or sentences 6 days a week on a theme from everyday life, \nChildren practice speaking: to learn a language you have to speak it! Our voice recognition system will allow children to practice on their own and improve their pronunciation. We make children proud to express themselves!\nOur content is curated for every age group during childhood, with a personalised course that adapts to each child's learning pace. Each year, children will be able to continue their adventure and continue to enrich their vocabulary and progress in oral expression.  \n\nThe Holy Owly method is organised in 7 stages: Discover, Repeat, Choose, Classify, Memorise, Play and Check. \n\n====================\nRECOMMENDED BY TEACHERS\nHoly Owly is the number one English application for children in France and is also recommended by teachers. Following numerous requests, we have adapted our methodology to schools in partnership with the publisher Bordas, and it is now used in several hundred classes in France! \n\n====================\nIn order to use all the functions of the application, you will have to choose a monthly or yearly subscription. You will have one week free before the first payment.\nTRY IT OUT WITH OUR FREE TRIAL WEEK\n\n====================\nThe content is 100% secure: without ads, children can learn safely.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Get ready to be outsmarted by your kids. Watch their vocabulary performance increase by 43% in just four weeks!\n\nYou may be thinking, \"Scooting? Stars? Swag? There's no way my child is actually learning anything!\" Well, welcome to game-based learning. In 20 minutes of gameplay a day, you'll see your child's confidence soar and their schoolwork improve. While kids are focused on having fun and acing the game, they’ll be learning up to 1,000 new words a year, all personalized to their level. \n\n“When will I see the results?” After three weeks! This is the time it takes to cycle through our spaced repetition algorithm, involving eight exposures to every new word. \n\n“Where can I see what they’re learning?” In the progress report! There you can track all the educational activities behind every star, coin, and gear item they’ve earned in the game. And the Word Bank section shows every word your child has learned playing Word Tag so far. \n\nWith characters designed by Craig Kellman (Madagascar, Hotel Transylvania), developed by the brilliant designers of Subway Surfers, crafted on the foundations created by the award-winning team of Mrs Wordsmith, and backed by a stellar team of literacy experts, Word Tag will have a lasting impact in the education and entertainment of the whole family. \nOur unique pedagogical approach was developed and endorsed by Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\n\nHow does it work, you ask? \nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory.\nWe developed several mini-games, to be played in a specific order, carefully scaffolded, with each mini-game building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning.\n\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across four different game activities:\nWord Jumble: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word.\nSynonyms or Word Pairs: It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\nWords in Context: Gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\nPop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz.\n\nWord Tag uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\n\nThe words kids see are tailored to their needs, including:\n-Creative writing and literature words\n-Textbook words from the Lexile database\n-US exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\n-UK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\n-Inspirational words\n-STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\n\n-No third-party ads, no in-app purchases (subscription)\n-Suitable for ages 7-13\n\nFor more information, have a look through our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

      "label": "◉ Let Mirinae be your AI Korean Teacher!\nYou enter a Korean sentence and Mirinae will translate the sentence, show you all the individual parts of speech, find and explain any grammar patterns present, explain the particles and honorifics and verb conjugations, identify & explain any idioms or neologisms used, and draw out a parse-tree showing all the individual phrases & clauses in the sentence.\n\nClick on anything in the explanation for more details, alternate word definitions, example uses, related patterns, cross-references to learning sites and major textbooks, and much more..\n\nAll this allows the learner to explore Korean wherever they encounter it, perhaps an example sentence in a dictionary or lesson text, some song lyrics or drama dialog, etc., and interactively discover its meaning, syntax, grammar patterns and any idioms used, and then to explore and continue learning, finding other examples of the patterns and words used.\n\n◉ Learn while watching Kdrama or browsing the web\nThere is also a Chrome Extension version that lets you explore and learn from Korean text you encounter on any website, including Kdrama subtitles on streaming sites like Viki.com, Netflix and Youtube.\n\nWhen enabled, the Mirinae extension will detect Korean on any web-page, so you can explore and get a deep understanding of any Korean directly within the page so that it can be very easily used to augment existing Korean teaching, reference and translation sites and video streaming sites. Visit the Chrome Store and search for “Mirinae”.\n\n◉ Built-in Dictionary, Searchable Grammar & Idiom Reference and Grammar-term Glossary\nMirinae has a built-in dictionary & searchable grammar reference and can also be used as a deep, interactive Korean reference that is driven by examples of the things you want to search for.    The library has a large and growing number of idiom patterns and neologisms (newly-coined words), essential for understanding modern spoken Korean, Kpop lyrics and Kdrama dialog.\n\n◉ High tech!!\nMirinae uses advanced machine learning, natural language processing and a non-deterministic phrase-structure parser, coupled with a proprietary regular-expression grammar-pattern, idiom and neologism library to build a lexical and grammatical analysis of the text, showing a breakdown of the text into its component words and particles and suffixes and other parts-of-speech along with a display of its structure in terms of phrases and predicates and clauses.\n\nIt also uses an advanced, bi-language embedding-vector meaning disambiguator to provide likely meanings for individual words in the sentence, which is not easily determined from a full sentence-translation, as you might get from a standard translation site.\n\n◉ User quotes:\n• “WHERE HAS THIS BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE\nAs someone who prefers to Korean deconstruct a sentence in order to learn how to put it together this is PERFECT!”\n\n• “I’ve been searching for something like this for a while now so this is amazing. Korean grammar is my weakest subject so this is beyond helpful. Thank you so, so much!”\n\n◉ FAQ\n•How to use Mirinae?\nVisit https://mirinae.io/#/support \n\n◉ NOTE\n• If you have any questions or suggestions please contact us:\n  - helpdesk: team@mirinae.io\n  - website: https://mirinae.io\n  - privacy policy: https://company.mirinae.io/privacy-policy/\n  - terms of use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\n  - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mirinae.io/\n  - twitter: https://twitter.com/mirinae_io\n  - youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/mirinae_io"

Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture. In contrast to a geo-cache or a scavenger hunt Actionbound requires the players to create their own content."

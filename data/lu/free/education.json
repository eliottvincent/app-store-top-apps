From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

In den Lernspielen werden Schul- und Zukunftskompetenzen gefördert.\n\nKinder begeben sich je nach gewähltem Lerninhalt gemeinsam mit unterschiedlichen Spielfiguren auf Lernreisen in unbekannte Welten. Sie befreien diese jeweils durch über 20 Lernspiele von den kleinen, süßen Chaosmonstern. In der „Welt der Worte“ unterstützen sie beispielsweise die Füchsin Mika darin, Ordnung zu schaffen und erlernen dabei Grundkenntnisse für das Lesen und Schreiben. Die Spiele sind auch nach der Freischaltung aller Lerninhalte beliebig oft wiederholbar und werden in Updates zusätzlich durch kleinere Spiele ergänzt. \n \nEDURINO wird gemeinsam mit PädagogInnen und LogopädInnen entwickelt und wöchentlich in unseren Partnerkindergärten getestet. Die App ist werbefrei, ohne In-App-Käufe und offline spielbar. Durch einen gesicherten Elternbereich, in dem die Bildschirmzeit angepasst und der Spielstand eingesehen werden kann, gibt die App Kindern die Möglichkeit, selbstständig zu spielen und zu lernen.\n \n \nWie funktioniert Edurino?\n \nDie EDURINO Lernapp funktioniert mit haptischen Spielfiguren und einem mit ErgotherapeutInnen entwickelten Dreikantstift. Die EDURINO Produkte können auf www.edurino.com erworben werden.\n \nDie Spielfiguren sind der Schlüssel zur digitalen Welt. Mit dem Aufdrücken der Spielfigur auf ein Smartphone oder Tablet werden die gewünschten Lernspiele, wie z.B. Erstes Lesen & Schreiben, Zahlen & Mengen oder Erstes Englisch in der EDURINO App freigeschaltet. \n \nDer ergonomische Dreikantstift unterstützt Links- und RechtshänderInnen bei der Entwicklung einer lockeren Stifthaltung und trainiert in jeder Lernreise die Schreibmotorik durch abwechslungsreiche Übungen.\n \n \nWeitere Informationen\n \nhttps://www.edurino.com/\nhttps://edurino.com/policies/privacy-policy\nhttps://edurino.com/policies/terms-of-service"

      "label": "Mussila is an award-winning music learning app for children. It allows kids to explore the world of music on their own and gives them the opportunity to gain knowledge without continuous external help.\n\nThe app provides hours of musical lessons, games, and challenges, carefully crafted by musical experts and educators, designed to provide a joyful experience. Mussila is perfect for beginners.\n\n“Magically, kids intuitively pick up on the basic principles associated with music and have a blast doing so!” With the Mussila subscription, your child will gain a solid musical foundation that lasts a lifetime.\n\nHow the app works: You can choose between four learning paths; Learn, Play, Create & Practice.\n\nThe Learning Path:\n\n- Progress through the fundamentals of music theory like learning to identify notes, tempos, and how to read sheet music.\n- Develop a sense of rhythm and timing through games with recognizable songs.\n- Identify different instruments by sound through games like “Memory” and more.\n\nThe Play Path:\n\n- Learn to play the piano! You can do so on your mobile device or use a keyboard at home through the app if you have one.\n- Play along to familiar songs like Happy Birthday, Mary Had a Little Lamb, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Row, Row, Row Your Boat, and more!\n- Graduate to more advanced pieces from Swan Lake and The Magic Flute and eventually tackle the masters like Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart.\n\nRegardless of where your child is on the Mussila learning path, you can practice and play along with them. No music experience is necessary!\n\nThe Create Path:\n\n- Music Machine allows children to explore different sounds and colors and create their own songs.\n- Mussila DJ encourages the player to create their own musical soundscape and remix existing songs.\n- Mussila Planets, it’s an arcade game on its own where kids can follow the rhythm of songs and practice their ear for music.\n\nThe Practice Path:\n\n- This path is good for teachers and parents if they want to concentrate on one subject in the learning. Here you'll be able to focus on: instruments, rhythm, or melody.\n\nFor optimal user experience, we recommend using headphones when playing the game or turning your speaker volume up.\n\n**Awards & Recognitions:**\n\n-Certified Education Quality by Education Alliance Finland\n\n-Winner of the Mom's Choice Award 2021\n\n-Top Ten EdTech Startup in Europe in 2020 by Education Technology Insight \n\n-Winner of the Academic Choice Award 2020\n-Winner of the Nordic EdTech Awards 2019\n-Winner of the Parents´Choice Award 2019\n-Winner of the German Pedagogical Media Award 2018\n-Creative Business Cup - Global Finalist 2018\n-Best app for kids 2020- Educational App Store\n-Best app for parents 2019- Educational App Store\n-Best App for teachers 2019 - Educational App Store\n\n**Subscription**\n\nMussila offers three types of subscriptions:\n\n- Monthly Premium Subscription\n- Mussila Premium Trimonthly Subscription\n- Mussila Premium Yearly Subscription\n\n7-day free trial!

This also includes the use of instruments to extend the range of our senses. \nUsing apparatus and equipment This is the skill of knowing the functions and limitations of various apparatus, and developing the ability to select and handle them appropriately for various tasks. \n\nIntroduction\nPlay with the Mass Scale Model. Test what you've learned by trying the input field. \nThis Mass Scale Model allows the skills of reading from a circular scale of a typical weighing scale. The three options available allows for student's own testing of the different scales with different decimal places of precision appropriate in each scale's smallest division.\n\nCommon misconceptions\nStudents typically can tell masses of whole numbers such as 600 g, but to be able to type in 0.60 kg requires some understanding of decimal places.\n\nNew Feature Added\nNow, grams option is added for ease of whole number learning\n\n\nSample Learning Goals\n(g) describe how to measure a variety of masses with appropriate accuracy by means of weighing scales.\n\nInteresting Fact\nThis simulation has touch-sensitive controls for the pointer and the actual reading (yes, I need to program for these features) which other apps may not have.\n\nAcknowledgment\nMy sincere gratitude for the tireless contributions of Francisco Esquembre, Fu-Kwun Hwang, Wolfgang Christian, Félix Jesús Garcia Clemente, Anne Cox, Andrew Duffy, Todd Timberlake and many more in the Open Source Physics community."

      "label": "Word Tag works\nGet ready to be outsmarted by your kids. This game will increase their vocabulary performance by 43% in just four weeks!\n\nIn 20 minutes of gameplay a day – with eight exposures to every new word over three weeks – you'll see your child's confidence soar and their schoolwork improve. While kids are focused on having fun and acing the game, they will be learning up to 1,000 new words a year, all personalized to their level. The learning happens almost invisibly, so they learn more because they are having fun (and it doesn’t feel like homework). And while they are busy getting all the fun rewards, you can track their advancement on a progress report showing all the pedagogical activities behind the chest of treasures your kid accumulates in the game.\n\nWith characters designed by Craig Kellman (Madagascar, Hotel Transylvania), developed by the brilliant designers of Subway Surfers, crafted on the foundations created by the award-winning team of Mrs Wordsmith, and backed by a stellar team of literacy experts, Word Tag will have a lasting impact in the education and entertainment of the whole family. \nOur unique pedagogical approach was developed and endorsed by Susan Neuman (Professor of Early Childhood and Literacy Education, NYU), Ted Briscoe (Professor of Computational Linguistics, University of Cambridge), and Emma Madden (Headteacher at Fox Primary, one of the UK’s top schools).\n\nHow does it work, you ask? \nWord Tag uses spaced repetition to teach vocabulary. This is the most effective way to learn new words. It works by repeatedly exposing kids to the same word, over a series of short, focused sessions, to make sure vocabulary gets stored in long-term memory.\nWe developed several mini-games, to be played in a specific order, carefully scaffolded, with each mini-game building further on kids’ understanding of a word. We took the elements that make for a great game (including rewards, exciting challenges, and a beautiful world to explore) and blended them with research on what boosts learning.\n\nKids will encounter the same word eight times, across four different game activities:\n\nWild Styling Syllables: In this game, kids unlock word definitions by working with jumbled syllables that must be placed in the right order. This introduces them to the meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of each new word.\n\nWild Styling Synonyms: It also reinforces word meaning by bringing in synonyms and word pairs.\n\nContext Sentence Game: gives kids a chance to use words in context by choosing the right word to complete a sentence.\n\nPop Quiz: This game helps recap what kids have seen before, as they choose synonyms and word pairs for multiple words in a fast-paced quiz.\n\nWord Tag uses individual feedback to repeat the words each child needs most, more often, based on their performance in the game. It modulates difficulty, making sure kids encounter words that are challenging enough to keep them engaged, but not so challenging that they get frustrated. This balance is what keeps kids learning.\n\nThe words kids see are tailored to their needs, including:\n\nCreative writing and literature words\nTextbook words from the Lexile database\n\nUS exam words (inc. SSAT, SAT)\nUK exam words (inc. KS1/KS2 SATs, ISEB 11+)\nInspirational words\nSTEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) words\n\nFor more information, have a look through our T&C:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/terms-and-conditions?_ga=2.116069062.1935758160.1595001437-1560637269.1540981688\n\nOr our Privacy Policy:\nhttps://uk.mrswordsmith.com/pages/privacy?location=GB"

      "label": "The math game Fiete Math makes counting easy for kids to understand. Based on the educational approach of Montessori, numbers are touchable objects that your child can group, combine and cut up. \nIn this math app children can discover the links between amounts and numbers and develop their confidence in dealing with them. This makes maths fun for kids.\n\nGAME PREMISE\n\nIn this math game the tasks take the form of wonderful harbor scenarios from all around the world. Incoming ships must be loaded by your kids. Boxes can be grouped together and separated just like building blocks. This will change the cargo number. Kids can play in new countries and harbors, win medals and unlock larger ships. This visible progression means more motivation to keep on playing.\n\nTHE BACKGROUND OF THIS APP - AN UNDERESTIMATED PROBLEM\n\nSeparating and combining numbers are important foundations to develop calculation strategies. Even an intense study of number systems and mathematic strategies during a normal school day is often not enough. Students who need more time can easily fall behind. Any problems in math are often left to be dealt with by an after-school tutor.\n\nOUR SOLUTION - AN APP WITH AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH\n\nIf your child doesn't understand the basics of numbers, repeatedly trying to solve mathematical problems will not help. This app uses a different approach.\n\nChildren learn through new, fun experiences. With this app, your child will experience and learn about the links between amounts and numbers through their own experimentation.\n\nCHILDREN IMPROVE\n\n• Fiete Math develops understanding of the number system, makes 5 and 10 structures usable and shows calculation methods.\n• The app lets your child play with numbers like building blocks. Abstract numbers are made into objects.\n• There are no time limits. Your child can complete the tasks at his or her own speed and gather important knowledge.\n\nThis App is not just a digital copy of a maths book. It innovatively uses the opportunities offered by touchscreen devices to make number systems more understandable.\n\nTo maintain your child’s motivation, we’ve made sure that this math app is fun like any other game. Best case scenario: your child won’t want to put Fiete Math down. Try that with a math textbook ;-)\n\nCONTENTS\n\n1. 1,2,3,...\nCounting, recognising groups\n\n2. SPLITTING NUMBERS\nDividing numbers in different ways, getting to know numbers up to 20\n\n3. THE MAGIC 5\nEasy calculations with 5s, progression to 10s, introduction to the decimal system\n\n4. MATH STRATEGIES\nDoubling and halving, swapping, neighbor tasks, changes in the same or the opposite direction\n\n5. PLUS\nPerfect packages, tasks from easy to hard, inverted tasks\n\n6. MINUS\nPerfect packages, tasks from easy to hard, inverted tasks\n\n7. PRACTISING\nPractice adding and subtracting\n\nThe app includes over 1,000 consecutive tasks using numbers up to 30. Once these are complete, the app randomly creates tasks from the relevant topic so the fun can go on for longer.\n\nFEEDBACK PLEASE\n\nTo develop this app, we carried out intensive research with education specialists and looked at very different teaching methods. We looked into the Montessori method, compared lesson plans, and delved into math books and textbooks by various publishers. We read teachers' manuals and spoke with educators, teachers and tutors. The most important thing is real feedback. We want to continue improving this app. Write to us with your experiences and ideas for Fiete Math: support@ahoiii.com\n\nVisit Fiete online at: www.ahoiii.com\nBeautiful Fiete products are available in our shop: www.shop.ahoiii.com\nBecome a fan!

Why not try it out and take on sailor Fiete!\nIn what is surely the most beautiful memo game, Seemann Fiete invites you to a game of “looking for pairs” in his lighthouse. Behind every porthole of the lighthouse, another exciting memo game with different themes and varying degrees of difficulty awaits you.\n\nIn Fiete Match, Fiete is the children’s opponent. In this memo game, Fiete picks up the cards and shows different reactions just like a real player - depending on whether he wins or loses. If you take a little longer to decide, Fiete sometimes even starts to yawn.

      "label": "The game Fiete Puzzle lets children discover cute animated animals in beautiful picture book landscapes. Impressive camera tracking shots turn this puzzle into something special. The intuitive controls and large puzzle pieces are ideal for infants.\n\nIn the puzzle app, the children visit farm and zoo animals with their hero Fiete and discover fire brigade vehicles, building site vehicles and the hustle and bustle of the port, shop for groceries with Fiete in the supermarket, have a birthday party, relax at the campfire, and put Fiete and his friends to bed at the end of the day.\n\nInfants, nursery children and preschoolers will not get enough of the lovingly illustrated puzzles. Inspired by classical lift-out puzzles, the educational game Fiete Puzzle is very easy to play.\n\nThe puzzle game playfully develops language skills, visual perception, and the ability to recognise shapes.\n\nGAME PREMISE\n\n- Each puzzle is a big, beautiful picture book scene. \n- Impressive camera tracking shots literally draw children into the scenery of each puzzle game. \n- At each camera stop, there are missing puzzle pieces in the picture.\n- Puzzle pieces are displayed to the children in the upper right-hand corner of the playing field. The children must find out where the puzzle part fits in and shift it to the right place in the game with their fingers.\n- The final puzzle part is not just any puzzle part, but a very special one - its Sailor Fiete himself. \n- After the children have inserted the puzzle part into the right place with Fiete, the puzzle is finished and the children are rewarded with an animation.\n- After each puzzle game, the children can move through the puzzle and observe their complete work, before moving on to the next animated puzzle game. This is where the parents and children have time to think up little stories about the respective puzzle motif.\n\nCONTENTS\n\n- 9 puzzles with beautiful motifs and exciting themes from the children´s world.\nNo advertising for third-party products\n\nPUZZLE MOTIFS\n\nFarm\nZoo\nFire Brigade\nSupermarket\nBirthday\nBuilding site\nPort\nCampfire\nGood night\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nBeautifully illustrated images\nEasy to use\nFun with learning\nGorgeous animations\nGreat sound effects\nClear, direct feedback system  \n\nCHILDREN IMPROVE\n\nLogical thinking\nAttention\nConcentration\nMedia literacy\nVisual perception\nEye-hand coordination\nLanguage development\nShape recognition\nCognitive skills\n\nTO PARENTS\n\nDear mums and dads, we ourselves are parents, and only make apps that we would not hesitate to play with our own children.

You get lots of Stapelstein game ideas and can even design your own games with the new Stapelstein Creator and save them in the app.\n\nWith the Stapelstein Creator, we want to make a lasting contribution to promoting media literacy in early childhood education. After all, the foundation for a competent approach to media can already be laid in preschool. Through their own actions, children can experience media for themselves. Active media work stimulates many senses and is successful even if no extensive media equipment is available. With a smartphone or tablet, a free stop motion app, and the Stapelstein construction sheet, children can give free rein to their creativity and, for example, create their own appealing animated films for their play ideas and then save them in the Stapelstein app. In this way, we support the self-determined, reflective and creative use of media.\n \nThe Stapelstein app makes moving education concrete and multidimensional. The simple operation focuses on the essentials and takes into account the individual needs and requirements that characterize each person, each group and thus each situation."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

That's why we have developed a revolutionary method for children aged 3 to 12. Children have the brain plasticity to learn new languages far more easily than adults!\n\n====================\nWHY DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS LOVE THE HOLY OWLY METHOD?\nIt's not just an app: Holy Owly is the result of 3 years of research and development within a school, where teachers, linguist researchers and hundreds of children have participated in the development of the pedagogical method and unique content.\nOur commitment:\nOnly 5 minutes a day of learning: this format constitutes a daily ritual encouraging memory anchoring without over exposure to screens,\nChildren learn while having fun: thanks to our teaching method and the immersive adventure in which they participate, they learn 3 words or sentences 6 days a week on a theme from everyday life, \nChildren practice speaking: to learn a language you have to speak it! Our voice recognition system will allow children to practice on their own and improve their pronunciation. We make children proud to express themselves!\nOur content is curated for every age group during childhood, with a personalised course that adapts to each child's learning pace. Each year, children will be able to continue their adventure and continue to enrich their vocabulary and progress in oral expression.  \n\nThe Holy Owly method is organised in 7 stages: Discover, Repeat, Choose, Classify, Memorise, Play and Check. \n\n====================\nRECOMMENDED BY TEACHERS\nHoly Owly is the number one English application for children in France and is also recommended by teachers. Following numerous requests, we have adapted our methodology to schools in partnership with the publisher Bordas, and it is now used in several hundred classes in France! \n\n====================\nIn order to use all the functions of the application, you will have to choose a monthly or yearly subscription. You will have one week free before the first payment.\nTRY IT OUT WITH OUR FREE TRIAL WEEK\n\n====================\nThe content is 100% secure: without ads, children can learn safely.

      "label": "The math game Fiete Math makes counting easy for kids to understand. Based on the educational approach of Montessori, numbers are touchable objects that your child can group, combine and cut up. \nIn this math app children can discover the links between amounts and numbers and develop their confidence in dealing with them. This makes maths fun for kids.\n\nGAME PREMISE\n\nIn this math game the tasks take the form of wonderful harbor scenarios from all around the world. Incoming ships must be loaded by your kids. Boxes can be grouped together and separated just like building blocks. This will change the cargo number. Kids can play in new countries and harbors, win medals and unlock larger ships. This visible progression means more motivation to keep on playing.\n\nTHE BACKGROUND OF THIS APP - AN UNDERESTIMATED PROBLEM\n\nSeparating and combining numbers are important foundations to develop calculation strategies. Even an intense study of number systems and mathematic strategies during a normal school day is often not enough. Students who need more time can easily fall behind. Any problems in math are often left to be dealt with by an after-school tutor.\n\nOUR SOLUTION - AN APP WITH AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH\n\nIf your child doesn't understand the basics of numbers, repeatedly trying to solve mathematical problems will not help. This app uses a different approach.\n\nChildren learn through new, fun experiences. With this app, your child will experience and learn about the links between amounts and numbers through their own experimentation.\n\nCHILDREN IMPROVE\n\n• Fiete Math develops understanding of the number system, makes 5 and 10 structures usable and shows calculation methods.\n• The app lets your child play with numbers like building blocks. Abstract numbers are made into objects.\n• There are no time limits. Your child can complete the tasks at his or her own speed and gather important knowledge.\n\nThis App is not just a digital copy of a maths book. It innovatively uses the opportunities offered by touchscreen devices to make number systems more understandable.\n\nTo maintain your child’s motivation, we’ve made sure that this math app is fun like any other game. Best case scenario: your child won’t want to put Fiete Math down. Try that with a math textbook ;-)\n\nCONTENTS\n\n1. 1,2,3,...\nCounting, recognising groups\n\n2. SPLITTING NUMBERS\nDividing numbers in different ways, getting to know numbers up to 20\n\n3. THE MAGIC 5\nEasy calculations with 5s, progression to 10s, introduction to the decimal system\n\n4. MATH STRATEGIES\nDoubling and halving, swapping, neighbor tasks, changes in the same or the opposite direction\n\n5. PLUS\nPerfect packages, tasks from easy to hard, inverted tasks\n\n6. MINUS\nPerfect packages, tasks from easy to hard, inverted tasks\n\n7. PRACTISING\nPractice adding and subtracting\n\nThe app includes over 1,000 consecutive tasks using numbers up to 30. Once these are complete, the app randomly creates tasks from the relevant topic so the fun can go on for longer.\n\nFEEDBACK PLEASE\n\nTo develop this app, we carried out intensive research with education specialists and looked at very different teaching methods. We looked into the Montessori method, compared lesson plans, and delved into math books and textbooks by various publishers. We read teachers' manuals and spoke with educators, teachers and tutors. The most important thing is real feedback. We want to continue improving this app. Write to us with your experiences and ideas for Fiete Math: support@ahoiii.com\n\nVisit Fiete online at: www.ahoiii.com\nBeautiful Fiete products are available in our shop: www.shop.ahoiii.com\nBecome a fan!

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

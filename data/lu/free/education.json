That's why we have developed a revolutionary method for children aged 3 to 12. Children have the brain plasticity to learn new languages far more easily than adults!\n\n====================\nWHY DO CHILDREN AND PARENTS LOVE THE HOLY OWLY METHOD?\nIt's not just an app: Holy Owly is the result of 3 years of research and development within a school, where teachers, linguist researchers and hundreds of children have participated in the development of the pedagogical method and unique content.\nOur commitment:\nOnly 5 minutes a day of learning: this format constitutes a daily ritual encouraging memory anchoring without over exposure to screens,\nChildren learn while having fun: thanks to our teaching method and the immersive adventure in which they participate, they learn 3 words or sentences 6 days a week on a theme from everyday life, \nChildren practice speaking: to learn a language you have to speak it! Our voice recognition system will allow children to practice on their own and improve their pronunciation. We make children proud to express themselves!\nOur content is curated for every age group during childhood, with a personalised course that adapts to each child's learning pace. Each year, children will be able to continue their adventure and continue to enrich their vocabulary and progress in oral expression.  \n\nThe Holy Owly method is organised in 7 stages: Discover, Repeat, Choose, Classify, Memorise, Play and Check. \n\n====================\nRECOMMENDED BY TEACHERS\nHoly Owly is the number one English application for children in France and is also recommended by teachers. Following numerous requests, we have adapted our methodology to schools in partnership with the publisher Bordas, and it is now used in several hundred classes in France! \n\n====================\nIn order to use all the functions of the application, you will have to choose a monthly or yearly subscription. You will have one week free before the first payment.\nTRY IT OUT WITH OUR FREE TRIAL WEEK\n\n====================\nThe content is 100% secure: without ads, children can learn safely.

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Lingvist is the language learning app built by scientists and language experts that teaches vocabulary better than anyone else in the world. The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period. When a subscription is canceled, access to the app's courses and features will expire at the end of the current payment period.\n\nVisit our blog to get tips, tricks, and interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Lingvist blog: https://lingvist.com/blog/\n\nFollow us to get interesting facts on how to learn languages:\n▸▸ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/theLingvist\n▸▸ Instagram: instagram.com/thelingvist/\n▸▸ Twitter: https://twitter.com/lingvist\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://lingvist.com/privacy-policy/\nTerms of Use: https://lingvist.com/tos/"

      "label": "Thousands of users love Intelli Flashcards for its simplicity, effectiveness and elegance.\n\nBut first things first. This app is not free, as the value you get using it properly is enormous. I also don’t want you to do a blind bargain by making this app a paid one. So here is the deal: download it for free, try it with the only limitation of 50 flashcards, and if you love it, support the project by making an in-app purchase.\n\nYou add flashcards on your own, with vocabs or information you want to remember. Alternatively, you can import a 2-column CSV file with vocabs, if you have one.\n\nThe app is built around Spaced Repetition technique, which is not the best to learn new information (yes, I was wrong believing that initially), but the best to keep the information you’ve learnt. However, you can also learn with flashcards if you have a good visual memory. The best combination: learn new information by building up the associations and move that information to long-time memory by repeating it with flashcards.\n\nUnder the hood you will find Sebastian Leitner’s algorithm which basically has two simple rules: if you remember what’s on the back side of the card, the repeating interval is doubled (1-2-4-8-16 days and so on). If you forget the back side, start all over again with daily repeating. \n\nIntelli Flashcards was designed to be used every day by someone, who learns foreign language. I’m aware of the fact, that average user would add 1500+ flashcards on his learning path. He might be outdoors and in a rush, so the process of creating a new flashcard is 0 clicks away - it’s right on the main screen! The repeating session is just 1 click away.\n\nAfter a year of testing the spaced repetition algorithm, Derek Sivers (entrepreneur, programmer, founder of CD Baby and just a great person) stated that it was the most helpful learning technique he has tried for 14 years. To read more about Derek’s experiment, visit  www.sivers.org/srs \n\nFrom developer: after finishing working on Intelli, I started to use it to learn Spanish just to test the effectiveness of this algorithm. Intelli is not the only tool I’ve used, but it had the biggest impact on the learning speed and effectivity. I went from 0 to C1 level in Spanish in just 1 year, spending in average 15-20 minutes on learning every day. To read about other tools I’ve used to learn Spanish, go to www.boweidmann.com/language-learning\n\nBut then I’ve stumbled upon a great article about language learning, written by Tim Ferriss, the best-selling author and self-experimenter:\n\nhttp://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/16/how-to-learn-any-language-in-record-time-and-never-forget-it/\n\nInspired by that article, I’ve worked on the possibility of adding images directly to flashcards. Version 3.0 was born. Thank you, Tim! That function has enhanced the experience the users have got with the app. And it’s much more interesting to recall a vocab looking on image. That’s how Rosetta Stone works. That’s how we recall our native vocabs. Maybe I should start a new language just to test this technique with images. ;)\n\nUser experience is one of the keywords this app is built around. So your opinion on that is very important to me. You can contact me personally out of the app and receive my response as soon as possible. \n\nWhen I develop a new version of the app, I make sure new functionality does not affect the original user experience. However, it’s hard to predict the way you are going to make use of it. So if there is some unexpected behavior of the app, feel free to tell me about it.\n\nAnd when somewhere in the future you realize, Intelli has supported you a lot on your path of learning, I’d love your short review in AppStore."

      "label": "This app was developed independently of the MIT Scratch Team, which produces the Scratch programming language and online community. The Scratch name and Scratch cat are trademarks of MIT.\n\n**NOW A TOP 20 EDUCATIONAL APP IN OVER 40 COUNTRIES****\n\n\"Tutorials for Scratch Lite\" brings you 3 sets of video tutorials to get you going making your very first activity and game in the new version of Scratch 2.0. However, these are not the sort of standard tutorials that you find on the web. During the videos you will be set tasks to do in scratch and hopefully you will be able to complete them on your own. However don't worry the next video in each project will show you how to complete the task!!\n\nThese videos are really targeted at primary/elementary students although the content of the full app will go on to stretch and challenge even the most able of them with variables, cloning, broadcasting and many other features of Scratch. \n\nThere's even a quiz in the app so you can test your scratch knowledge too!!\n\nScratch really is a fantastic way into learning programming and coding and this app hopefully will be a great asset to get you going with it.\n\nThis is a big app of just under 100Mb, because there is so much material in it, even for a \"lite\" version. You will need to be hooked into your WiFi connection!!  \n\n*TEACHERS* the point of this app is that kids can use the iPad alongside the pc to build their games in Scratch. You can just sit back and relax without having to plan anything. Oh and there is enough material in the full version to keep your students busy for around 6 hours, even if they don't manage to have a go at the extension tasks that are identified for all 5 games!!"

      "label": "Learn Korean by speaking from the start!\nPractice speaking essential Korean expressions in first-person POV scenarios.\n\n===========\n\n• \"But I can just learn Korean by watching Kpop!?”\n\nJust like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS or watching Crash Landing on You! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop and watching Kdrama. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK Korean, you have to, well – SPEAK! Teuida's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.\n\n• 3 min > 30 min\n\nWe believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speak (long lecture videos).\nWhy waste your precious time learning about Korean when you can learn Korean by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Overcome fear of speaking\n\nResearch shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? Teuida helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)\n\n• What about those other apps?\n\nMost apps out there are vocabulary-building games and will teach you a lot of new words and basic hangul. But if your goal is to actually speak Korean, then well let's face it... no amount of matching words with cute pictures will improve your speaking.\n\n===========\n\nHere’s a list of things that make Teuida different:\n\n•  Essential expressions :\n\nNo more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no Korean people actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say \"I am a boy, you are a woman\" in real-life?)\n\n• Taught by Bilingual Tutors:\n\nOur crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak Korean but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!\n\n• AI Pronunciation Analysis:\n\nWhat's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? Teuida has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.\n\n• Fun, Interactive Stories:\n\nWe believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.\n\n• Real-life Scenarios:\n\nReal-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to talking to your KPOP bias. Okay, that last scenario isn't really an everyday situation. But hey! You never know! ;)\n\n• Culture-specific tips:\n\nA wise man once said that \"the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool\". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of Korea.\n\nSo... what are you waiting for? Stop reading and start speaking with Teuida!\n\n===========\n\nPlease note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features."

Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Grâce à une progression adaptée au rythme du joueur, Mathador Classe Solo est idéal pour se perfectionner en calcul mental. 30 niveaux de difficulté croissante, 3 points d’entrée pour une difficulté maîtrisée. \n\nEnchaînez des épreuves de calcul de type « compte est bon » et des énigmes mathématiques (carré magique, suite logique, petits problèmes mathématiques à résoudre...) pour atteindre le plus haut niveau. Au fur et à mesure, les épreuves sont de plus en plus compliquées et le chronomètre de plus en plus court... Décrochez trophées et bonus : vous allez être surpris par votre progression en maths  !\n\n\nAVEC MATHADOR SOLO, L’ÉLÈVE\n \n• Teste des hypothèses pour trouver progressivement la bonne méthode de recherche,\n• Travaille la perception des ordres de grandeur, \n• Utilise de manière progressive multiplication et division,\n• Mémorise les tables de multiplication et d’addition,\n• Acquiert des automatismes de calculs,\n• Applique ses compétences en calcul mental en résolvant de petits problèmes,\n• Fait appel à sa logique pour résoudre les énigmes,\n• Et surtout, prend plaisir à manipuler les nombres et les opérations.\n\nIdéale pour les élèves du CE2 à la 3ème, l’application peut être utilisée dès le CE1.\n\n\nCOMMENT ACCÉDER AU JEU \n\nMathador Classe Solo propose trois modes de jeu :\n \n1. Mode Enseignants et élève :\nCe mode réservé aux enseignants ou élèves disposant d'un compte Mathador Classe, permet de jouer à l'ensemble des niveaux et enregistre votre partie là où vous l'avez arrêtée. Avec près d'une centaine items à débloquer pour enrichir votre avatar, plus d'une vingtaine de trophées et statistiques de jeu, et trois niveaux de difficulté correspondant au niveau scolaire, vous pourrez progresser à votre rythme toute l'année !\n\n2. Parents d'élève et joueurs Grand Public :\nCe mode permet aux joueurs Grand Public ou aux parents d'élève d'acheter jusqu'à 4 comptes de jeu premium afin d'accéder à la version illimité du jeu. Cette version comporte les mêmes fonctionnalités que la version pour les élèves et les enseignants.\n\n3. Mode invité :\r\nCe mode gratuit permet de découvrir 9 niveaux du jeu Solo. Il ne nécessite pas de connexion avec un compte mais ne permet pas d'enregistrer la progression de jeu ni d'avoir accès aux fonctionnalités de la version illimitée.\r\n\n\nDÉROULEMENT DU JEU\n\nLe jeu comporte 30 niveaux réparties en 4 niveaux de difficulté. Chaque niveau comprend 9 épreuves : 6 tirages et 3 énigmes mathématiques. \nLe temps alloué pour résoudre ces 9 épreuves est de plus en plus court et la difficulté augmente également :\n\n• Les énigmes et problèmes se complexifient\n• Le nombre-cible des compte-est-bon est de plus en plus élevé\n• Les épreuves comportent de moins en moins de solutions possibles\n• Des contraintes s’ajoutent parfois : obligation d’utiliser l’addition et/ou la soustraction, puis la multiplication ou la division\n• Les derniers niveaux requièrent un certain nombre de points pour être validés\n\nLes bonus aident l'élève à progresser tandis que les trophées encouragent l’élève et lui proposent de nouveaux défis à relever !\n\n\nA PROPOS DE L’ÉDITEUR\n\nL’application Mathador Classe Solo est éditée par Réseau Canopé, établissement public sous tutelle du ministère de l’éducation nationale.\nCette application a été développée en collaboration avec l’inventeur du premier jeu Mathador, un enseignant de mathématiques.\n\nLe ministère de l’Éducation Nationale a réaffirmé l’importance de l’apprentissage des fondamentaux dont le calcul mental, notamment via l’utilisation de jeux. Mathador s’inscrit pleinement dans cette dynamique d’apprentissage ! Les jeux sont également recommandés dans le rapport Villani-Torossian « 21 mesures pour l’enseignement des mathématiques ».\n\nCONTACT\n\n• Email : mathador@reseau-canope.fr \n• Twitter : @mathador\n• Blog : https://blog.mathador.fr/ \n• Site web : www.mathador.fr\n\nPOUR ALLER PLUS LOIN\n\nDécouvrez également l’application Mathador Classe Chrono et défiez le temps en enchaînant le maximum de calculs !"

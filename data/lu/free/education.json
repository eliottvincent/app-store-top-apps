Over 25 years of language learning experience has taught Rosetta Stone one thing: everyone has the ability to learn to read, write, and speak a language with confidence. Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words.

The app provides an exciting experience marked by a thoughtful design.\n\nWith ISS Live Now, you can view interesting live video streams directly from the International Space Station’s cameras.\n\nThe app utilizes the native Google Map (ISS tracker), which allows you to follow the Space Station’s orbit around our planet. You can zoom, rotate, drag and tilt the map;.\n\nYou will have these different sources of live video streaming, including:\n1. Live standard camera: It shows a live stream of the Earth and, from time to time, details about the ISS (like tests, maintenance and communication with Earth).\n2. NASA TV: The television service of the United States government agency NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). You can watch science and space documentaries, interview with scientists, astronauts, engineers and personalities such as Elon Musk.\n3. NASA TV Media.\n4. Spacewalk (recorded): Beautiful HD images of astronauts from cameras outside the ISS.\n5. Inside the International Space Station: Take a video tour of each module inside the ISS, all explained by the astronauts.\n6. Eventual channel: Temporary live cameras from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) and the SpaceX.\n\nYou even have the option to be notified when the next sunset or sunrise will occur, allowing you to watch it live directly from the International Space Station. \n\nNote:\nWhen the ISS (International Space Station) is on the night side of Earth, the video image is black, which is normal.\n\nSometimes, video is not available due to transmission issues, or because the crew is changing cameras. In such cases, you will usually have a blue or blank screen. In a few minutes the transmission should return, so, please be patient. This is not a problem with the app.\n\nTwitter: @isslivenow - You can find news about the ISS, NASA, space, Earth and the video stream.\nInstagram: isslivenow - Pictures taken of the Earth by the streaming cameras and NASA TV.\nFacebook: isslivenow - Pictures, news and Information about the ISS Live Now app."

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

The Museum has placed more than 700 Bluetooth beacons throughout its 45 permanent halls. These tiny beacons give off signals that your phone can detect (when Bluetooth is enabled). Your phone calculates your position based on detecting three of these beacons simultaneously. This triangulation is not always perfect, especially in certain areas like large, multi-level halls, meandering walkways, or stairwells. Your phone should be able to detect the hall that you are in and provide turn-by-turn directions, but sometimes the “blue dot” is not exactly in the right place. In some rare cases it will even be missing. Moving to another area and waiting a few moments will usually fix the issue.\n\nThe Museum’s free AMNH-GUEST Wi-Fi also varies in strength throughout the complex. Certain materials and large exhibits (i.e. the Blue Whale) either absorb or reflect the radio signals used by Wi-Fi, further complicating this technology. If you experience difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi in a particular part of the Museum, you can usually fix the issue by moving a short distance away.\n \nWe’d Love to Hear From You!\nYour feedback is important and will help us improve your Museum experience.

      "label": "Dive into the heart of Bois Jacques on a unique immersive journey with the Easy Company thanks to Overlap Reality®, a technology developed by SkyBoy that enhances the effects of augmented reality.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Bois Jacques, an historic site of the Battle of the Ardennes, was the scene of terrible battles between the American and German armies.\n\nIn December, 1944, Bastogne is situated on the route of the German Fifth Armoured Division. The Germans have a very clear plan, which involves taking the important crossroads that form Bastogne as quickly as possible and heading towards the river Meuse: the Panzer Lehr Division 130 must capture the town by surprise, while the Panzer Division 2 must bypass it and attack the Meuse. Meanwhile, the Volks-Grenadiere-Division 26 must attack the resistance pocket.\n\nBut the Americans on the ground and the reinforcements hastily sent in in trucks resist to defend the city! And on December 19, the 101st American Airborne Division comes to the rescue. However, The GIs are quickly surrounded.\n\nIt is in this context that, on December 20, 1944, the 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Regiment, of which the famous Easy Company is a member (“Band of Brothers”), takes up position in Bois Jacques. It will remain there until the beginning of January, 1945, before giving way to other units of the 101st Airborne Division.\n\nAfter fierce resistance to German attacks, the time comes for the American counter-attack in early January, 1945. In mid-January, the German army is still resisting fiercely but is seriously weakened: its supply is becoming increasingly complicated and its tanks run out of fuel. On January 28, 1945, the Battle of the Ardennes comes to an end. Its consequences prove decisive for the continuation of the conflict, and deal a fatal blow to Adolf Hitler’s ambitions.\n\nAware of the exceptional heritage character and historical value of this site, the City of Bastogne, IDELUX and INTERREG wished to promote it.\n\nUsing a dedicated mobile application, this particular digital project offers visitors of Bois Jacques the chance to be plunged into a series of six immersive, 360°, geo-localised videos, each lasting two to three minutes. Each audiovisual work, a true historical re-enactment, follows soldiers who belong to one of the Easy Company’s divisions, recounting a scene from their daily life of war, each spot being about a particular day and event.\n\nBenjamin Brillaud, alias NOTA BENE, is the red thread of the journey but knows to regularly disappear so as to allow the spectator to enter into the heart of history, inviting them to put themselves in the soldiers' shoes.\n\nThis mobile application is funded by the INTERREG V A GRANDE REGION programme as part of the “Land of Memory” project. It is produced by SKY BOY on behalf of IDELUX Public Projects.\n\nThe application is available in French, English, Dutch and German.\n\nHow does it work?\n 1/ Meet at Bois Jacques\n 2/ Scan the QR code or connect to the \"Bois Jacques\" Wi-Fi\n 3/ Download the application in the app-store of your smartphone\n 4/ Launch the application to load the content\n 5/ Place yourself on one of the points materialized by a target\n 6/ At each point of interest, aim at the target and click on the screen to start the video"

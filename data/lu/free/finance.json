The app is very intuitive\" - Michael P.\n\"Makes sharing bills with friends so much easier, many useful options, an absolute must have.\" - Tom C.\n\"Super useful - my flatmates and I can't live without it anymore!\" Sarah P.\n\nTHEY RECOMMEND TRICOUNT :\n\nFORBES:\n\"With Tricount, you can create a group expense report on your phone. It tracks spending by person, and then splits up how much each individual owes or is owed from the total balance. When you’re ready to share the final breakdown, the app sends each person a link to Tricount’s site to review the data.\"\n\nBUSINESS INSIDER:\n\"Next time you organize a group activity, Tricount will split up the expenses for you\".\n\nABOUT IN-APP PURCHASES\n\nAs of version 2.1, Tricount offers in-App purchase subscriptions valid for one year. \n\nThe price of the subscription is 6.99€ (Premium) and may depend on your territory and is clearly indicated on the subscription page. Payment will be directly charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal. The subscription renewal costs the same price as the one of the original subscription. After purchase, you can disable auto-renewal in your user's Account Settings. Note that no cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. Tricount's terms and conditions are available at https://tricount.com/en/terms\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\ncreate a tricount, share your link with friends ... et voilà!\n\nTricount makes sorting out and divvying your group expenses very easy when you organize activities (for example: ski trip, citytrip, holidays with a classroom, flatmates etc.)\n\nGone are the days of the old excel file: an easier and effective solution exists to breakdown the costs, sharing expense reports, list tickets and spending. Tricount does the accounting and balances the cost for your group expenses.\n\nIt lets you breakdown the budget of a group and track expenses during a trip or any occasion with friends. It can be used by couples, between colleagues, roommates & flatmates. It is a simple yet powerful tool to figure out who owes what to whom and balance spendings : I owe you, you owe me (IOU) ... so easy!\n\nCreate your group expenses on your mobile (even offline), during your group activity. Send everyone the link (a la Doodle), and your friends too can add their own expense or see your changes.\n\nTricount then tells you who should pay what to whom to balance the group.\n\nVery useful for any activity with friends and colleagues: holiday, city-trip, flat sharing & flatmates, week-ends, everyday lunch with colleagues, parties, etc. In your couple, you can create a tricount to know who has paid what this month, or on holiday.\nThe app exists for most mobile devices, and on the web! All currencies are accepted, even bitcoins if you want."

It meets banking-grade security standards; all payments are authorised with your biometrics or your PIN Code. You can set your security limits according to your preferences (default: EUR 2,500). Payments are made using (SEPA) bank transfer (funds may only be available the next working day). \n \n* QUICK ACTIVATION\n \nTo start using the App right away, all you have to do is to link it to your bank account. Launch the App and you’ll be guided through the process, it’s fairly easy. \n \n* SEND, RECEIVE & REQUEST MONEY\n \nPayconiq is by far the fastest way to transfer money between two people. Choose the recipient’s phone number from your address book, type in the amount, authorise the payment and a SMS/push message is sent to the recipient. If the recipient has already activated Payconiq, the operation is triggered immediately, and if not, a SMS message is send out inviting the recipient to subscribe. Once he/she has activated Payconiq, funds will be transferred into the recipient’s bank account. \n \nRequest money from any phone number: the most convenient way to get paid back by your friends, family or colleagues.

Validate the payment with your biometrics/PIN Code and you’re done.\n\n* BILL PAYMENT WITH QR CODES\n \nThe quickest way to pay the bills: launch the App, scan the Payconiq QR Code on the bill, confirm the payment and you’re done, typically in less than 10 seconds. It works with your insurance and energy bills, with your telecom and public sector/municipality invoices provided Payconiq payments are accepted. \n \nFeel free to use it at Payconiq partner restaurants as well: no need to wait for the payment terminal, just scan the QR Code on the bill. You may even add a tip and then just leave right away. \n \n* PAYMENT IN OTHER APPS & IN ONLINE STORES\n \nTop up your kid’s Restopolis account or use Payconiq on selected web sites: it is the most secure and the most convenient way to pay by clicking on the Payconiq button in the App/web site or in the web store. No card or bank data is transferred and nobody else can use your Payconiq App as all payments are authorised via fingerprint/PIN Code."

Es ist notwendig, Transaktionen mit Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) über in-App-Benachrichtigungen zu sichern. Hierfür wird eine zuvor generierte anonyme Firebase-Installations-ID (FID) an Google gesendet, damit wir App-Nutzer identifizieren und ihnen Nachrichten zu SCA-Zwecken senden können. Die Installations-ID wird im Schlüsselbund Ihres Geräts an einem sicheren Ort gespeichert, der für die Bereitstellung der Dienste unbedingt erforderlich ist, und wird entfernt, wenn die App deinstalliert wird. Zusätzlich zu den obligatorischen SCA-Benachrichtigungen wird die FID auch als unbedingt notwendig für optionale Benachrichtigungen verwendet, die Sie innerhalb der App anfordern können.

Self-custodial means not even Bitcoin.com has access to your funds, and you can easily port your assets to another crypto wallet whenever you want. No lock-ins, and you'll never again ask for permission to use *your* money.\n\nDEFI READY\n\nConnect to Ethereum and Avalanche DApps via WalletConnect. That means you can earn interest on your crypto, trade using decentralized exchanges, participate in NFT marketplaces, access lending markets and much, much more.\n\nQUICK & SECURE ACCESS\n\nUnlock your Wallet app with biometrics or PIN.\n\nAUTOMATED BACKUP\n\nConveniently back up all your wallets to the cloud and decrypt them with a single master password. Replace the hassle of managing numerous secret phrases with the convenience and security of a single custom password. (You can still opt to manually manage your individual seed phrases).\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FEES\n\nYou decide the network fee. Up the fee for faster network confirmations. Lower it when you're not in a rush. Bitcoin.com takes ZERO fees (you pay only to use the public blockchain networks).\n\nLOW-FEE CHAINS\n\nThe multichain [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) Wallet is committed to giving you access to low-fee public blockchains so that you can use peer-to-peer cash as it was intended AND make the most of the opportunities available in the web3 space. \n\nAVALANCHE SUPPORT\nNow you can buy, sell, swap, hold and manage AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain. \n\nSHARED WALLETS (MULTI-SIG)\n\nCreate multi-signature wallets to manage funds with your team or friends and family.\n\nWIDGETS\n\nInstall live market-data widgets on your home screen. Track BTC, BCH, ETH, AVAX and your favorite ERC-20 tokens throughout your day.\n\nMARKETS VIEW\nTrack the price action and get key info on the top cryptocurrencies.\n\nPERSONAL NOTES\n\nAdd text to your transactions to remind you who sent what, when, and where.\n\nSEND VIA SOCIAL\n\nFor BCH, thanks to low network fees and near-instant confirmation time, you can send a payment link (aka \"Sharable Link\") to anyone using any channel (eg. Messenger, SMS, email, Whatsapp, and so on.). Funds are received/claimed instantly with just one click.\n\nINSTANTPAY\n\nSet your spending threshold, then scan a QR code with the request amount set on the recipient's device. Your payment will complete in an instant (BCH only).\n\nDISCOVER\n\nUse the Discover section in the app to locate merchants near you who accept cryptocurrency payments in-store. Browse websites where you can checkout with crypto and find other cool features like games, gift cards, and more.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY CURRENCY\n\nChoose your preferred display currency alongside your crypto (eg. USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and more).\n\nORGANIZE YOUR HOLDINGS\n\nCreate any number of wallets to organize your funds as you see fit. Drag and drop to re-order your wallets, and hide wallet balances that you don't want prying eyes to see.\n\nAUDITED BY KUDELSKI SECURITY\n\nA comprehensive 2022 audit from the renowned cybersecurity experts proved there is no real-world scenario in which an attacker would be able to compromise a user’s private keys."

You pay $100 for gas for the trip. Anyone with a calculator can divide that price three ways, but even then, you’d normally have to keep a record of the expense in order to divvy it up later. With Splittr, this expense is entered in a couple of seconds and divided equally with little time or effort.\n \nImagine that later, you, Emma and Daniel go to a restaurant. You’re not hungry, so you only order juice. Daniel orders a steak and a cheesecake. Emma gets a spinach salad. The bill is $80. Daniel forgot his wallet in the hotel room and doesn’t pay, but you chip in $60 and Emma pays $20. You need a math degree to calculate who owes what, right? Not with Splittr! Simply enter who paid how much and Splittr will do the rest.\n \nIt’s that simple!"

Bitpanda GmbH is a successful fintech company based in Vienna, Austria, founded in 2014 by Eric Demuth, Paul Klanschek and Christian Trummer. At Bitpanda, we firmly believe in the innovative power of cryptocurrencies, digital assets and blockchain technology. Bitpanda’s mission is to tear down the barriers to investing and personal finance and to bring traditional financial products into the 21st century.\n\nWhat are cryptocurrencies?\nCryptocurrencies are digital assets. They are used in technical applications, regarded as investment and used as means of payment. Cryptocurrencies are secured by decentralised networks and ideally not controlled by any individual actors. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies in the market that have been programmed for a wide variety of use cases. Cryptocurrency trading is based on speculating on price movements by buying and selling cryptocurrencies on an exchange.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin (BTC) is the most popular and best-known cryptocurrency with the highest trading volume. Bitcoin is based on cryptography in a peer-to-peer network without a central authority. This means that nobody owns or controls the network and everyone can participate.\n\nWhat is Ethereum?\nEthereum is a second-generation blockchain based on the ideas and concepts of Bitcoin. The aim of Ethereum is to create a worldwide, decentralised and secure operating system by using digital contracts (smart contracts) and decentralised applications (DApps) to expand use cases for blockchains which traditionally required a central intermediary. The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain is Ether (ETH)."

If you're into trading, then use our purely AI driven trade signals which provide you with up-to-date trade recommendations. You can use these recommendations to support your buy, sell or HODL decisions.\n\n- Simultaneous price comparison of multiple exchanges like Kraken, Binance, Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, Poloniex, OKEX, HitBTC, Bitpanda, Bitfinex, Bitstamp & Coinfinity\n- Trade Signals: Strong Sell, Sell, Neutral, Buy, Strong Buy\n- Simply switch between Euro, Dollar, Sterling (FIAT currencies) or BTC & XRP markets\n- Quickly spot the cheapest & most expensive price\n- Change History & Volatility Monitor with insight into trends and volatility of the crypto markets\n- Arbitrage calculation: Difference between lowest purchase price and best selling price -> theoretically possible profit in high-frequency trading\n- Real-time quotes for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, IOTA, EOS, Stellar, DASH & other cryptocurrencies\n- Benchmarking between FIAT currencies (€, $, £) and Altcoins (ETH, BCH, LTC, XRP, IOTA, EOS, XLM, DASH)\n\nBitcoin Monitor supports the following cryptocurrencies and markets:\n\nBitcoin (BTC):\n- BTC / EUR\n- BTC / USD\n- BTC / GBP\n\nEthereum (ETH):\n- ETH / EUR\n- ETH / USD\n- ETH / BTC\n\nBitcoin Cash (BCH):\n- BCH / EUR\n- BCH / USD\n- BCH / BTC\n\nRipple (XRP):\n- XRP / EUR\n- XRP / USD\n- XRP / BTC\n- XRP / ETH\n- XRP / LTC\n\nLitecoin (LTC):\n- LTC / EUR\n- LTC / USD\n\nIOTA (MIOTA):\n- IOTA / BTC\n- IOTA / USD\n\nEOS:\n- EOS / USD\n- EOS / EUR\n\nStellar (XLM):\n- XLM / USD\n- XLM / BTC\n\nDash (DASH):\n- DASH / USD\n- DASH / BTC\n\nSwitching between markets helps you get a broader insight into the market situation. You can also compare the performance of Bitcoin in different currencies (Euro, Dollar, Sterling) and even measure Bitcoin against Altcoins like Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ripple, IOTA, XLM, EOS & DASH.\n\n- Change & Volatility Monitor:\nThe Change & Volatility Monitor describes the direction and magnitude of price fluctuations. If Bitcoin performed positively within the given time span, it is colored in green. Otherwise it is colored in red. Further intervals allow you to examine the price action more closely. The displayed price for an interval is the average price of all exchanges for that moment. Its relative change compared to the price 24 hours ago gives you an understanding of the trend and volatility of the market.\n\n- Cross Coin Check\nOur Cross Coin Check gives you a broad insight into market developments and allows you to compare Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and IOTA (MIOTA) among each other. For this purpose, we continuously calculate all the prices and calculate the relation to each other. It is important for us to emphasize that the prices are obtained directly and unaltered by the exchanges! That means, our exchange rates are not manipulated (yes, we're hinting at 'Coinmarketcap').\n\n- Trade Signals\nOur purely AI driven trade signals provide you with up-to-date trade recommendations. You can use these recommendations (strong sell, sell, neutral, buy, strong buy) to support your buy, sell or HODL decisions.\n\nThe current prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, XLM, EOS, DASH and IOTA are obtained directly from the exchanges and are not altered like on Coinmarketcap. This means that you get live tickers from exchanges like Kraken, Binance, Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, Poloniex, OKEX, HitBTC, Bitpanda, Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Coinfinity.\n\nWith our free crypto apps you're well equipped to make the right buying or selling decision of Bitcoin and Altcoins!\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://bitcoinmonitor.app/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://bitcoinmonitor.app/eula"

Using the built-in brushes and canvases, you can depict any picture, limited only by your own imagination. At the same time, you can copy the image in reality, applying a stencil to a blank sheet of paper.\n\nSelect the required image. It can be loaded from the device memory, as well as download the basic stencils available inside the application. The program will automatically position the sketch on the canvas, while giving you the opportunity to change the image parameters. The picture can be rotated, enlarged or made transparent using the corresponding sliders located at the bottom of the screen.\n\nPainter Eye: Canvas Creator has rich set of sketching features. You can change the color and drawing style of the sketch, turn it into a monochrome copy, or convert fresh photos into a stencil. Pictures of any quality can be placed on the entire space of the canvas and sequentially draw complex elements. You can even turn his own portrait into a sketch, having previously loaded it from the smartphone's memory.\n\nTerms of Use - https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nPrivacy Policy - https://www.appodeal.com/home/privacy-policy/"

      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

This measuring method is already very precise and is constantly being further developed. However, this is also heavily dependent on the performance of the end device, the lighting conditions and the experience of the user. Measured values obtained from this procedure should also be checked with conventional measuring devices. Floor Plan AR is designed to help you quickly create 2D and 3D sketches. By using Floor Plan AR, the user agrees that no claims can be made against the developer due to measurement errors, inaccuracies or operating errors.\n\nIs your device compatible?\nIf your device contains a gyroscope and is compatible with ARKit, then yes!\n\nIf you have any questions or need help, please send an email to the email address provided."

      "label": "Create stunning AI-generated art - with no ads ever. Type a prompt, pick a style, then generate an image. Each style adds expert keywords to help you create incredible AI-generated paintings, photographs, and drawings. The best part? You get dozens of results for free.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Describe what you want to create. Be descriptive and creative or even use the built-in text scanner to pull a passage from a book. \n\n2. Pick a style. We’ve curated each style to add hyper-specific text to compose prompts that lead to the best outcomes. This is one of the hardest parts of generating AI images and Creator's styles ensure that you generate great results every time. \n\n3. Get incredible images for free. You’ll see an infinite number of generations. And we'll never show you any annoying ads. Depending on the style you picked, we'll instantly show you images from a massive library of millions of expert-generated AI images. If you want something more unique, we'll send your prompt to a different AI model (such as Dall-E or Stable Diffusion.) Through this approach, we can instantly provide an unparalleled number of high-quality options.\n\nWhat makes Creator different?\nOur goal is to simplify the world of AI-generated art and photos. We give you the best outcome, with the simplest method, for the best price. We give you more free access than any other app and we don't make you sit through ads to get them.\n\nPrompt writing is also an art, so our styles will add descriptive text to your prompts to help improve your images. Here’s an example:\n\nYou type \"futuristic car flying through space\".\nYou select a style that looks like a painting.\nThe prompt becomes: futuristic car flying through space, oil painting, organic lighting, godrays, high contrast, denoised, intricate detail, studio quality, cinematic lighting, vivid colors, HQ, award winning, incredible, gorgeous.\n\nEach style has different terms that we've found lead to incredible results and we'll give you dozens of images to choose from - so you're not stuck paying for images you don't like. Once you find an image you love, you can update the aspect ratio or even upscale the resolution. Save it as a lock-screen wallpaper, share it with your friends, print a poster, or post it on social media and go viral.\n\nOr just keep trying different prompts to see what the AI comes up with. The possibilities, and fun, are endless.\n\nA few unique things about Creator:\n\n- Dozens of results for free. Free users can see lots of different results from a single prompt. By integrating multiple models into our app, we’re able to provide an experience that makes our app the most user-friendly on the market.\n\n- Instant results and no ads. Creator displays results almost instantly. And you will never have to sit through an ad to use it — even on the free plan.\n\n- Expert generated prompts. AI art has a language of its own. We learned that language so you don’t have to.\n\n- Ultra-high-resolution outputs. We use an AI-upscaling model to turn images into print-worthy creations. A 512 x 512 output can be upscaled to over 6k pixels.\n\n- Aspect-ratio controls. Change the aspect ratio and crop the image within a container. Create different assets for different platforms to share with your friends\n\n- Gallery. Save your images and prompts to a gallery to refer to them later.\n\n- Text-scanning. Found a particularly compelling passage from The Great Gatsby you want to visualize? Scan text to create your prompts. The results can be wild!\n\n- Frequent improvements. The world of generative AI is constantly adapting. Tools like Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion are adding new features at a breakneck pace. We stay on top of the trends so you don't have to. Creator will update as more models and features become available.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.creator-app.com/privacy-policy\nEnd-User License Agreement: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/\nTerms of Use: https://www.creator-app.com/terms"

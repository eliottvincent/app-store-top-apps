      "label": "With Widgy, your home and lock screens becomes YOUR screens. You can make any kind of widget imaginable that perfectly matches the rest of your aesthetics. All the information you need can be easily surfaced through a widget that you designed. You don't have to clutter your screen with the information you don't want, it's just what you want, how you want it.\n\n• It's simple to make a widget •\n\nYou don't need to be a professional designer, you just need to know what you want. Once you figure that out, it's a matter of letting your creativity flow. Just add an element, pick a data source, throw on some effects, and put it where you want. Then repeat to add another element. After a while, you'll have a perfect widget, and all you need to do is to assign it to a widget slot and drop it on your home screen. There it is, marvelous! \n\nThe Widgy editor only has two parts. The preview and the layer list. When editing a layer, you get a couple of different sections that let you tweak the appearance and data of that layer. Each section has several special things you can do to the layer. The Preview will always show you a live display of exactly how the widget will look on your home screen, so you don't have to constantly go back and forth between the editor and home screen.\n\n• Everything you need •\n\nWidgy provides all the different elements that you would ever need to make your widget perfect. Along with that, there are all the data sources you could ever need, everything from system info to weather. And with all these data sources, there are several ways to display the data, whether it's a text, a nice chart, or something else.\n\n• There's no limits •\n\nThis isn't an app full of templates, everything is 100% customizable and interchangeable. It's your widget, and you choose how to make it. The only limit is your imagination. \n\n• Sharing and discovering is easy •\n\nYou can privately share widgets with your friends or publicly with all  Widgy users, all with a couple of taps. You can share your widget as a URL, QR Code, JSON data, a file, or you can publish it to be shown in the Explore section for all the Widgy users to see. \n\nOther than the Explore section, Reddit (r/Widgy) and Discord communities have produced thousands of Widgy widgets so far. So if you just want to browse widgets or if you need some inspiration you can get that too!\n\nNOTE: Widgy optionally integrates with Apple Health. This integration is used to display your data if you select one of those widget types. Permission for Widgy to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.\n\nAs with Health, all other permissions for Widgy are optional and are there just to show you the data you want to be displayed.\n\nWidgets for screenshots designed by SCOSeanKly.\nSome of the icons packs in screenshots designed by bulldog5278."

The second device, goes in your hand and displays the live feed. The app then puts a transparent image you want to draw on top of the feed.\n\nUnlike a projector, Mural Maker lets you accurately compare colors and shades on on your canvas to the reference image as well as letting you trace outlines!\n\n- Works outdoors\n- Works in the daylight\n- Make HUGE or small artwork\n- Record a time-lapse of your work\n- Same great Da Vinci Eye Tools (Breakdown / Strobe / filters)"

Enter the prompt and press the Create button to immediately create the art. For example, if you type in a cat flying in the sky, you will get an image exactly like that.\n\n2. Enter an image and a prompt, and the AI will generate art as you imagine it with reference to the image. For example, if you upload a sketch of a person's composition, an image identical to that composition will be created.\n\nLet's enjoy making art with AI!"

      "label": "Moves by Maxon is available on the iOS App Store for all iPhones and iPads running iOS 15.0 and later.\n\nGet Your Moves On!\n--------------------\nWith Moves by Maxon for iPhone and iPad you can capture facial and full-body movement or scan 3D objects and then bring them into 3D space in Cinema 4D.\nWhether you want to bring your facial expressions, best dance moves or a model of your favorite teddy bear into the world of 3D, Moves by Maxon is the perfect app. Download it now!\n\nObject Capture\n----------------\nPhotogrammetry based object capture couldn't be easier! Place the object you want to import in a well lit spot where it can be photographed from all angles. Start taking snapshots and the on-screen tool shows a record of where you have snapped. Moves by Maxon will let you know when there are enough images. Then connect and send the images to Cinema 4D and watch the magic happen!\nFor best results, start practicing with simple objects such as a small stuffed toy or desktop sculpture.\nNote - Object Capture is only supported by Cinema 4D 2023 and later running on macOS Monterey. \n\nFacial Motion Capture\n-----------------------------\nWith Face Capture, you can capture facial expressions with iPad or iPhone. It's as easy as recording a selfie video. Start the camera and off you go. The app uses the capture data to generate a moving 3D model in real time, which you can then transfer to 3D geometry in Cinema 4D. The movements of your facial expressions are precisely detected and can be used to create impressive facial animations in Cinema 4D without any previous knowledge. Want to learn how? Check out our tutorials on www.cineversity.com.\n\nBody Motion Capture\n----------------------------\nYou can record entire body movements as well! When videos are recorded in the Moves by Maxon app with your iPhone or iPad camera, Apple ARKit analyzes the movements in realtime and creates an animated 3D \"skeleton\" that is superimposed on the video. This provides a preview and the ability evaluate the recording of your moves.\nOnce you've imported the capture data into Cinema 4D - a simple and intuitive process - you can adjust the data there and transfer it to a 3D figure to perform your very own moves.\nPlease note: Capturing body motion is a relatively new feature of Apple's ARKit, so capturing clean full figure motion requires some preparation and finesse. Therefore, there are a few things you should consider when capturing body movements to ensure good results.\n\nContrast Matters\n----------------------\nThe person being captured should stand out from the background. So, choose dark clothes for light backgrounds and vice versa. Fitted clothing will produce better results than loose or baggy clothing. Extreme patterns in clothing are also not optimal.\n\nDon't Move Too Fast\n---------------------------\nDue to the motion blur that occurs when recording fast movements, the contours can become blurred and no longer be precisely captured by the app. Pirouettes and similar fast movements should be avoided for best results.\n\nAvoid Overlapping\n------------------------\nMoves by Maxon may not be able to distinguish and interpret movements where arms or legs cross each other or are crossed in front of or behind the body correctly. This can cause captured movement to \"fidget\" for a short time. Quiet movements without repeatedly crossing the arms or legs provide more accurate recordings.\nCinema 4D is required to utilize the captured movement and the Moves by Maxon connectivity comes preinstalled. If you do not have Cinema 4D, a free trial version is available at www.maxon.net."

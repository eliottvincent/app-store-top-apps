      "label": "Macadam is the first step counter app that makes you earn money when you walk.\n\nEvery step you do is tracked in the app with our pedometer and is automatically rewarded with real financial gains. \n \nLooking for a pedometer that really motivates you by paying you for each step? It's right here!\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE PROFITS WITH MACADAM \n\nStep #1 Macadam connects to your phone's step counter via Apple Health \nStep #2 The app earns you corners every time you put one foot in front of the other, whether it's a walk or a real run. \nStep #3 You can then exchange this virtual currency for real euros, spend your earnings at our partners or request a bank transfer. \n \nPut on your sneakers and go for a walk or a run, we promise you that it pays off!\n\nMacadam works equally well for walking, hiking, running or even a marathon. \n\nWHY A PEDOMETER THAT PAYS ME? \n \nTo fight against sedentary lifestyle! One human out of 2 has a sedentary lifestyle, which is a real health problem. \n\nMany people find it difficult to motivate themselves and stay in shape. So we try a funny and modern approach: The Reward! Rewarding people with money when they motivate themselves by walking. \n\nWith Macadam you can either walk or run! What matters to us is to reward you for getting moving. \n\n\nSTEP COUNTER APP FEATURES: \n\n- Pedometer (Number of steps, distance and kilometers traveled)\n- Calorie Tracker (Number of KCAL calories burned) \n- Step converter (convert your steps into euros) \n\n\n\nWHAT HEALTH AND WALKING DATA IS AVAILABLE?\n\nLike all step counters, our pedometer gives you access to the number of your daily steps, as well as a tracking of caloric expenditure and distance traveled.\nOf course, your data is completely anonymous and we will never sell it. \n\nMacadam does not use any GPS data and does not affect your battery.  \n \n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS : \n\n- What currency do I earn with the Macadam pedometer? \n\nThe app allows you to earn coins. This currency can be exchanged into money (euros) with a few clicks in the app. \nAlthough it is a virtual currency, coins are not a cryptocurrency, and we are not a web3-based move-to-earn app. \n\n- Is the step counter reliable? \n\nYes, we use data from Apple Health pedometer step sensor. For even more accuracy, you can use any connected watch or bracelet compatible with Apple Health (Apple Watch, Withings, Honor, Suunto, Fossil, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n\n- Can I use it for running? \n\nOf course you can! Macadam works perfectly with running. \n\n- Are you affiliated with any other apps that pay for walking (walk to earn)? \n\nMacadam is an independent walk to earn app and is not affiliated with Sweatcoin, StepN, Walk and Earn, million Steps, Fancy Gifts, Nike+ Running, Strava, Charity Miles, Runkeeper, Endomondo, Calo, Fitmint, Movn, Wirtual, Istep, Aglet, Moofit, Movez\n\n\nGrab your legs, your feet, put on your shoes, your sneakers, go for a run or a walk and start earning money with Macadam step counter. \n\nYou walk ? We reward! Download Macadam"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

Start slow with a gentle walk and reward yourself with an exclusive offer from one of your favourite brands, including adidas, Deliveroo, Shell, and lots more. \n\nEmotion in motion - get started today.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\nStep 1 - Select your mood to see running or walking challenges and rewards suited to your energy level.\n\nStep 2 - Browse through your selection of challenges, and start the one that's right for you! \n\nStep 3 - Move, feel good, repeat! Steps are counted via your iPhone or smartwatch wherever you go. Reach the step-count before time runs out to beat the challenge and get your reward!\n\nStep 4 - Congrats, you did it! You've won the reward and unlocked new challenges linked to new rewards...\n\nStep 5 - Redeem your prize via promotional code, QR code, or get it directly in the app. For sustainability challenges, your contribution will be made on your behalf automatically and you can watch the progress as a community!

Monitor your pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Receive reminders to check your pulse and track your vitals on a daily basis so you can stay healthy and fit. Get your stress levels under control and your negative emotional reactions identified and leveled.\n\nThe Main Advantages of the App:\n- Measure your heart rate using your fingertip and camera\n- Use Journal to monitor your blood pressure and oxygen saturation\n- Get daily health assessment and lifestyle advice\n- Develop healthy habits with Habit Tracker\n- Manage your emotional wellbeing with Mental Health Tests\n- Follow Self-Love Program to achieve harmony and peace of mind\n- Add tags and comments to your measurements\n- Integrate with Apple Health, and your pulse measurements will be sent to the Health app, making it even easier for you to keep track of your heart and overall health.\n\nHow to Check Pulse Using Finger:\n- First, make sure your fingers aren’t cold.

      "label": "Bei den meisten Besuchern die in einem Fitnessstudio trainieren um dort den Körper zu formen, Muskeln aufbauen oder Fett verbrennen möchten, scheitert das persönliche Vorhaben nicht am Willen, sondern häufig an einem falschen Trainingsplan und noch häufiger am fehlenden Ernährungsplan.\r\n\r\nDabei kann ein schneller Muskelaufbau oder das Abnehmen einiger überflüssiger Pfunde so einfach sein. Wäre da bloß nicht die immer ungewisse und quälende Frage: \"Wie trainiere und ernähre ich mich richtig um meine Fettverbrennung und Muskelwachstum anzuregen?\"\r\n\r\nDas große Problem: Es gibt keine pauschale Antwort auf diese Frage! Kein Fitnesstrainer, kein Online Coaching Portal und auch kein Ernährungsberater kann diese Frage pauschal beantworten. Grund dafür ist, dass jeder Mensch, um mit dem ein und gleichen Ernährungsplan und Trainingsplan Erfolg haben zu können, auch die gleichen Voraussetzungen mit sich bringen müsste, sprich bei jedem Menschen müssten u.a. folgende Faktoren gleich sein wie zB. Alter, Geschlecht, Größe, Gewicht, Körpertyp, Grundumsatz, Arbeitsumsatz, Kalorienbedarf, Schlafdauer, Gesundheitszustand, Stoffwechseltyp usw.\r\n\r\nDa diese Möglichkeit niemals gegeben sein wird, benötigt jeder Mensch einen eigenen, auf seine Voraussetzungen und Bedürfnisse zugeschnittenen, individuellen Ernährungsplan und Trainingsplan.\r\n\r\nFakti ist, so individuell wie jeder Mensch ist, genau so individuell muss auch die Betreuung in Punkto Training und Ernährung sein. Wer mit einem persönlichen, individuellen Ernährungsplan und Trainingsplan seine Ziele verfolgt, wird diese schneller und ohne Umwege erreichen.\r\n\r\nMit unserem Know-How und unserer Erfahrung aus dem erfolgreichen Coaching von hunderten von Sportlern, angefangen vom Hobby-Sportler, bis hin zum leistungs- und wettkampforientiertem Fitness- und Bodybuilding Athlet, ist das individuelle Erstellen von Trainings- und Ernährungsplänen, sowie die Betreuung unserer Coaching-Kunden unsere tägliche Arbeit, die wir mit Herz & Leidenschaft verfolgen.\r\n\r\nDie Trainingspläne und Ernährungspläne für unsere Kunden werden bei Sportnahrung-Engel Coaching von unseren Caoches per Hand mit viel Engagement und Herzblut erstellt. Das beweist die hohe Zufriedenheit und großartige Erfolgsquote unserer Kunden.\r\n\r\nGerne erstellen unsere Fitness-Coaches auch Dir Deinen individuellen Ernährungsplan und Trainingsplan - für Deinen Erfolg!\r\n\r\nJedes Jahr finden regelmäßig unsere beliebten Coaching Challenges statt. Das Jahr startet immer mit der Fly to USA Coaching Challenge, diese geht über 4 Monate und die drei besten Transformationen gewinnen tolle Preise. Im Sommer startet die nächste Challenge mit Fly to Summer und macht Dich in nur 2 Monaten fit für den Sommer."

      "label": "Keep Swiss COVID certificates easily and securely on your mobile phone\n\nCOVID Certificate is the official app for storing and presenting Swiss COVID certificates. It is developed by the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication FOITT on behalf of the Federal Office of Public Health.\nIn Switzerland, people who have been vaccinated, or who have tested negative or recovered from COVID can apply for a COVID certificate.\n\nCOVID certificates are issued in hard copy or electronic format serve as proof of: \n1. Vaccination against COVID-19\n2. Recovery from Sars-CoV-2 infection\n3. A negative result following Sars-CoV-2 test analysis\n\nHow the app works\n\nWhen the app is first launched after installation on the mobile device, a brief introduction provides information on how to use it and how to scan a hard-copy COVID certificate.\nIn the app, the required COVID certificate can be selected, and presented if desired. The app shows the time of your vaccination or test and how long ago you had the vaccination or test. All data contained in a certificate's QR code can also be displayed.\n\nIt is possible to store several COVID certificates in the app, e.g. for family members, or several COVID test certificates.\n\nUse of the COVID Certificate app is voluntary and free of charge.\n\nData protection is a top priority\n\nCOVID certificate data is stored solely on the mobile device. COVID certificates are protected by a digital seal (signature) and are thus forgery-proof.\nCOVID certificates are generated by the FOITT, but are not stored in a central system. That is why it is not possible to obtain a copy of an issued certificate.\n\nThe use of the app is limited to Switzerland and is subject to Swiss law."

      "label": "The Secret of Weight (TSOW) is a convenient and easy to use photo-based calorie counting app that offers a fun and enjoyable way of maintaining, losing or gaining weight, depending on your objective!\n \nWe have all heard of calorie counting, but what does that really mean?  Can this concept be used easily?  How do you count calories anyway? \n \nThe Secret of Weight gives you all the answers!  How many calories are you entitled to each day? What happens if you go overboard?  Find out with this app! The best feature of all, however, is that this app makes calorie counting a breeze thanks to the photo-based food choices to select from!\n \nHow does it work?\n \n- Each day, you work with a set Calorie Budget that you can “spend” on your food choices, not matter what they are, without gaining any weight.  You therefore work with a set number of Calories each day, which means you can “spend this budget” on any type of food you like!  There are no food restrictions, the point being that as long as you stick to your budget, you will not gain weight!  This is the real Secret of Weight!\n \nOkay, so how does it all work?\n \n- Each time you eat something, look it up in the photo database and add that item to your cart for the day.  A bar gauge on the side of the Dashboard shows how many Calories you have left for that day.\n- If you go over budget, you start gaining weight.  The equivalent amount of weight gained is displayed on your app in real time, based on how many extra Calories you have consumed.\n- If you stay under budget, you start losing weight.  The equivalent amount of weight lost is displayed on your app in real time, based on how many less Calories you have consumed.\n \nThis new concept is based on the idea that there are no forbidden foods, even when you want to lose weight!  You will also find out how high or low your calorie intake should be to gain or lose a few pounds.\n \n \nContents:\n- Calorie gauge and dashboard\n- Food database:\n1661 photographs of food\n1934 food items\n- Add new food items to the database, with or without pictures\n- Add your own recipes, with or without pictures\n- Keep track of frequently chosen items by adding them to your Favorites list\n- Food cart (food cart content can be viewed for the ten previous days)\n- Customized settings\n- Help topics\n- Virtual coach “Flo” guides you through the app\n- Customize your dashboard gauge by changing colors (by holding your finger on the gauge)\n \nNo hidden in-app purchases.  The only suggested purchase is the book by the same name, The Secret of Weight, that explains the entire method in detail. \n \n \n \nTest this great tool for yourself!\n \nThe application has voluntarily been designed with few options:  the point was to keep it as simple as possible.  All options are therefore quick and easy to discover (even if you will need a few minutes of attention to grasp the concept).  Thanks to the help options, you can start keeping track of your weight in just 15 minutes.  Make it easy!  Think easy!  Diet easy!"

      "label": "Nous sommes un jeune couple chrétien, Jeanne et Thomas, et nous avons créé Meditatio pour te faire découvrir la méditation chrétienne, qui peut transformer complètement ta vie !\n\nSelon les termes d’un moine bénédictin, la méditation chrétienne est “le moyen très simple par lequel nous nous mettons peu à peu en paix avec nous-mêmes, afin d’être capables d’éprouver la paix de Dieu en nous”. Elle est ainsi un incroyable lieu de ressourcement auprès de Dieu, lui qui est la véritable source de tous les bénéfices que tu peux tirer de la méditation, et plus encore, l’auteur anonyme d’innombrables bienfaits qui vont bien au delà de tout ce que tu peux imaginer.\n\nMeditatio propose un parcours d'introduction à la méditation chrétienne, avec :\n- 9 jours de formation avec des audios de 5 min\n- 8 méditation guidées du \"parcours\" découverte\n\nDès les premiers jours de pratique, tu pourras faire l'expérience de ces bienfaits : paix et joie.\n\nEnsuite, tu trouveras de nombreuses méditations guidées autour de thèmes (joie, paix, plénitude, gestion du stress et des angoisses,...) et de passages de la Bible. Tu trouveras également un écran de méditation libre avec divers outils te permettant de te relaxer (notamment avec des exercices de relaxation issus de la méthode Vittoz, des exercices de respiration,...) puis de prendre un temps de silence avec Dieu, accompagné d'un passage ou d'un verset biblique si tu le désires.\n\nMeditatio propose une approche très accessible qui s'adresse à tous : aux chrétiens convaincus mais aussi à tous ceux qui \"ne se retrouvent plus trop\" dans cette religion et dans son institution, ou plutôt dans l'idée qu'ils s'en font. Notre objectif est de te faire découvrir à quel point Dieu peut changer ta vie si tu lui consacres un petit temps quotidien, et de te permettre d'être rapidement autonome même sans aucune expérience préalable de méditation ou de prière chrétienne.\n\nTextes bibliques tirés de la Bible Nouvelle Français courant © Société biblique française - Bibli'O, 2019 avec autorisation.\nLa responsabilité de la Société biblique française - Bibli'O est engagée uniquement sur les textes bibliques cités dans cette application."

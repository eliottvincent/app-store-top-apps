      "label": "Dreaming of a flat belly, lean legs, and toned glutes? Get desired results in 30 days with Gravity Fit: choose workouts for your trouble zones or train your entire body using a ready-made program designed for your needs and parameters.\n\nWe guarantee you will achieve your goals, just like these other users:\n\n”I'd like to thank Gravity Fit for an excellent training program. You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

      "label": "This app is the remote control for all Lovense wearable toys. \n\nDesigned for:\n1.\tSolo Play\n2.\tDiscreet Public Play\n3.\tLong Distance Play\n\nUse one smartphone for close range control, syncing vibrations to music, and sound activated vibrations (uses your phone's microphone).  Range for close range control is up to 30 feet when you have a direct line of sight. 360° range is between 5-10 feet, based on your surroundings.\n\nUse two smartphones to drastically increase your partner's control range. This is perfect for those wanting discreet public play within larger spaces. Simply connect with your partner's phone within the app and give up control! The person with a toy should have their smartphone within 3-5 feet of them at all times. The app can run in the background, so it can be in your purse or pocket while your partner has complete control via their smartphone. This feature is also great for long distance couples. \n\nYou also have the ability to create your own vibration patterns. Our fun tap and slide control interface makes it easy to make unique patterns. Our powerful vibration motor allows a large range of possibilities. After creating a pattern, you can share it (anonymously) with the world. Take a look at the vibration patterns already uploaded and download the ones you like! \n\nOther Settings (must select for each partner):\n-\tGive full control to some (don't need to continually allow them to gain control)\n-\tVibration notifications during text messages\n-\tNotifications when you partner logs into the app\n-\tAuto-play a pattern when it’s sent to you\n\nNot seeing a feature you would like? Contact us at support@lovense.com! Our full time development team would love to incorporate your suggestions into our app."

      "label": "Macadam is the first step counter app that makes you earn money when you walk.\n\nEvery step you do is tracked in the app with our pedometer and is automatically rewarded with real financial gains. \n \nLooking for a pedometer that really motivates you by paying you for each step? It's right here!\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE PROFITS WITH MACADAM \n\nStep #1 Macadam connects to your phone's step counter via Apple Health \nStep #2 The app earns you corners every time you put one foot in front of the other, whether it's a walk or a real run. \nStep #3 You can then exchange this virtual currency for real euros, spend your earnings at our partners or request a bank transfer. \n \nPut on your sneakers and go for a walk or a run, we promise you that it pays off!\n\nMacadam works equally well for walking, hiking, running or even a marathon. \n\nWHY A PEDOMETER THAT PAYS ME? \n \nTo fight against sedentary lifestyle! One human out of 2 has a sedentary lifestyle, which is a real health problem. \n\nMany people find it difficult to motivate themselves and stay in shape. So we try a funny and modern approach: The Reward! Rewarding people with money when they motivate themselves by walking. \n\nWith Macadam you can either walk or run! What matters to us is to reward you for getting moving. \n\n\nSTEP COUNTER APP FEATURES: \n\n- Pedometer (Number of steps, distance and kilometers traveled)\n- Calorie Tracker (Number of KCAL calories burned) \n- Step converter (convert your steps into euros) \n\n\n\nWHAT HEALTH AND WALKING DATA IS AVAILABLE?\n\nLike all step counters, our pedometer gives you access to the number of your daily steps, as well as a tracking of caloric expenditure and distance traveled.\nOf course, your data is completely anonymous and we will never sell it. \n\nMacadam does not use any GPS data and does not affect your battery.  \n \n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS : \n\n- What currency do I earn with the Macadam pedometer? \n\nThe app allows you to earn coins. This currency can be exchanged into money (euros) with a few clicks in the app. \nAlthough it is a virtual currency, coins are not a cryptocurrency, and we are not a web3-based move-to-earn app. \n\n- Is the step counter reliable? \n\nYes, we use data from Apple Health pedometer step sensor. For even more accuracy, you can use any connected watch or bracelet compatible with Apple Health (Apple Watch, Withings, Honor, Suunto, Fossil, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n\n- Can I use it for running? \n\nOf course you can! Macadam works perfectly with running. \n\n- Are you affiliated with any other apps that pay for walking (walk to earn)? \n\nMacadam is an independent walk to earn app and is not affiliated with Weward, Sweatcoin, StepN, Walk and Earn, million Steps, Fancy Gifts, Nike+ Running, Strava, Charity Miles, Runkeeper, Endomondo, Calo, Fitmint, Movn, Wirtual, Istep, Aglet, Moofit, Movez\n\n\nGrab your legs, your feet, put on your shoes, your sneakers, go for a run or a walk and start earning money with Macadam step counter. \n\nYou walk ?

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985.

      "label": "MIEUX VIVRE LE STRESS AVEC RESPIRELAX+\n\nDepuis sa création en 2012 par les Thermes d’Allevard, l’application RespiRelax+ vous permet de retrouver calme et détente en quelques minutes seulement. L’évolution que nous vous proposons aujourd’hui intègre toutes les demandes faites par les utilisateurs de RespiRelax depuis 2012. \n\nElles ont été longuement travaillées et mises au point avec le docteur David O’Hare expert international en la matière et auteur de différents ouvrages sur le sujet dont les fameux « 365 – guide de la cohérence cardiaque jour après jour » et « Maigrir grâce à la cohérence cardiaque ».\nMalgré la complexité des modifications proposées, l’esprit Respirelax+ est toujours présent : une application gratuite, efficace, à l’esthétisme particulièrement soigné et d’utilisation simple grâce à une ergonomie très intuitive.\n\nNouveautés 2017\nAvec cette nouvelle version, il vous est désormais possible :\n- De poursuivre l’utilisation habituelle de l’application à savoir un guide respiratoire vous amenant à l’état de cohérence cardiaque grâce à la respiration 5 secondes /5 secondes (5/5 soit 6 cycles complets par minutes) avec possibilité de travailler des effets dynamisants ou relaxants (légère augmentation ou réduction des phases d’inspiration ou d’expiration).\n- De pratiquer les yeux fermés grâce à l’ajout d’une musique qui suit le rythme 5/5. Cette musique originale a été aimablement composée par Pascal Gravante(1) (uniquement en mode équilibre).\n- Pour les débutants, la fonction « entraînement » permet d’arriver progressivement et facilement au rythme 5/5 sur une session de 10 minutes.\n- Pour les experts, il est désormais possible de régler le temps d’inspiration et le temps d’expiration en fonction des données physiologiques de l’utilisateur, notamment l’utilisation du rythme 5,5/5,5 qui semble procurer chez certains de meilleurs résultats. \n- Augmentation notable de la durée des sessions selon les effets désirés.\n- Refonte de l’environnement graphique\n- Disponible sur Apple Store et Google Store\n\nExercez-vous maintenant…\nVous pouvez faire cet exercice, en prévention, trois fois par jour ; avant un événement stressant (prise de parole en public, décision importante, …) ; lorsque vous vous sentez stressé ou irritable ; avant de vous endormir. Pour ce dernier cas, il faut débuter par une session de quelques minutes au rythme 5/5 puis passer au rythme 3/3 pour activer l’endormissement.\n\nEtape 1\nFaites les réglages du RespiRelax+ en fonction, du nombre de respirations complètes à la minute (par défaut 6), de l’effet escompté : équilibre, détente ou dynamique et de la durée de l’exercice (Pas moins de 3 minutes).\nLancez l’application RespiRelax+ et synchronisez votre respiration sur la bulle qui monte (j’inspire) et qui descend (j’expire). L’inverse est aussi possible (j’inspire à la descente et j’expire à la montée) si vous souhaitez coordonner votre exercice à la montée et la descente du diaphragme. \nDans tous les cas, vous devez respirer tranquillement, sans forcer. Une fois que vous êtes à l’aise Il s’agit tout simplement de centrer son attention sur la région du cœur au centre de la poitrine.\nEtape 2\nImaginez, ensuite, que votre respiration entre et sort de votre cœur, au niveau du plexus solaire. Inspirations et expirations restent calées, tout en douceur, sur la bulle qui monte et descend.\nEtape 3\nTout en maintenant votre attention sur le cœur et la respiration confortable, concentrez-vous sur le souvenir d'un moment agréable. Essayez, alors, de laisser venir, sans forcer, le sentiment de satisfaction, de bien-être, ou de plaisir attaché dans votre mémoire à ce moment privilégié.\n\nCette application a été développée par les Thermes d’Allevard (Isère-France), \nPour aller plus loin : www.thermes-allevard.com\n\n(1) – Pascal Gravante, compositeur suisse."

      "label": "Gymnast Fit is the new app for gymnastics based fitness. Ultimate Functional Fitness. Now you can train like a gymnast...anytime, anywhere. Fundamentals, flexibility, inversion, mobility and targeted training.  Choose a training program or create your own custom sets from our huge library of moves. \n\nBy most measures, gymnasts are some the most functionally fit athletes on earth. This app now lets you train like one. All the moves are demonstrated by Matvei Petrov, professional gymnast and  4 time Russian champion.\n\nTRAIN LIKE  A GYMNAST\n- 10-20 minute workouts based on gymnastics fitness training\n- Total body training, mobility, inversions and more!\n- Perfect for beginners to advanced athletes\n- State-of-the-art videos showing correct execution, alignment and flow\n- Create your own custom workout sets\n- Train with your community of friends and stay motivated\n- Track your daily progress and stay on point\n- Set daily reminders for yourself (Get off your butt! Too sore to comb my hair!)\n\nGymnastic strength is functional fitness. It's different than the strength you get from bench press and squats, which are in a single plane of motion using primary muscle groups. Before we can get close to achieving a gymnastic physique, we need to reclaim our range of motion, not even a gymnast’s range of motion, but the normal range of human motion we were born with...\n\nFOUNDATIONS\nStrong basics are the foundation of your training. Core strength combined with agility and flexibility drill. Start slow and work your way up.\n\nFLEXIBILITY\nIncrease your range of motion and prevent injury by improving your flexibility. Lunges, pike, pancake positions, backbends and leg splits.\n\nINVERSION\nCrow, crane poses, headstands, wrist preparations and handstands. A step-by-step progression to make you love being upside down.\n\nMOBILITY\nLearn agility moves, learn to move like an animal. These are the foundations of natural body mechanics linked with use of momentum and alignment.\n\nTARGETED TRAINING\nOur targeted training lets you focus on arms and shoulders, abs and core, legs and torso mobility. Train your strength and range of motion.\n\n*****\n\nHOW TO USE THE APP & SUBSCRIPTIONS\nThe download and use of Gymnast Fit is free. Get all available workouts within the app as part of the monthly subscription. Gymnast Fit is now offering a SUPER AUTUMN SALE with an annual subscription of only $29.99! (just $2.50/month!)

Being more flexible can also reduce the chances of injury when exercising, though the biggest benefit will be in the way you walk and stand. This 30-day program will help you increase your flexibility. \n\nThe program utilises a mixture of active (leg raises) and passive (holding the splits position) stretching techniques to give you the fastest gains possible in the shortest time.\n\nIf you have stiff hamstrings, locked-up hips, and a painful lower back; if you’ve tried yoga and stretching exercises, but didn’t see many results, then there’s a very good chance we can help you."

      "label": "Die Migräne-App ist ein Meilenstein in der Vorsorge und Behandlung von Migräne und Kopfschmerzen. Sie wurde in enger Zusammenarbeit von Experten der Schmerzklinik Kiel, des bundesweiten Kopfschmerzbehandlungsnetzes und der Techniker Krankenkasse entwickelt. Die Migräne- und Kopfschmerz-Selbsthilfe-Communities auf Facebook und www.headbook.me begleiteten kontinuierlich die Entstehung mit. Die neue Migräne-App eröffnet völlig neue Möglichkeiten in der digitalen Versorgung von Migräne und Kopfschmerzen. Sie begleitet und steuert den persönlichen Behandlungsverlauf. Sie liefert Orientierung und bahnbrechende neue Möglichkeiten, was in Sachen Dokumentation, Diagnostik, wirksame Behandlung, Vermeidung von Chronifizierung, Messung der schmerzbedingten Behinderung, Entspannung, Stressabbau, Wissen, Information, Ernährung und Fitness wirklich zählt. Sie ermöglicht zudem den bundesweiten Austausch und die digitale Vernetzung sowohl von Betroffenen untereinander als auch mit Migräne- und Kopfschmerzexperten. \n\nDie Migräne-App eröffnet den Nutzern, eine aktive Rolle bei der effektiven und zeitgemäßen Vorbeugung und Behandlung ihrer Migräne und Kopfschmerzen zu übernehmen. Sie gibt individuell einen Überblick über Behandlungspläne und hilft personalisiert bei der Umsetzung von Leitlinien. Ein „Cockpit“ mit Anzeigeinstrumenten auf der Begrüßungsseite informiert über alle relevanten Daten zur Akutbehandlung und Vorbeugung. Sie überwacht Symptome und Medikamente. Sie stellt aktive Behandlungsverfahren wie die progressive Muskelrelaxation für die Vorbeugung zur Verfügung. Der Migräne- und Kopfschmerzverlauf wird kontinuierlich dokumentiert und analysiert. Auslösefaktoren wie z. B. Wetterdaten werden automatisch dem Verlauf hinzugefügt, um Zusammenhänge zwischen Wetterveränderungen und Migräne persönlich zu erfassen. Die Migräne-App warnt bei Überschreiten der Einnahmegrenzen von Akutmedikation. Sie hilft aktiv, Komplikationen wie den Medikamenten-Übergebrauch-Kopfschmerz (MÜK) zu vermeiden. Die Behinderung durch Migräne- und Kopfschmerzen kann so durch die digitale Technik aktiv wirksam reduziert werden. \n\nEin Schnelltest hilft bei der Erfassung des Kopfschmerztyps. Skalen ermitteln das Risiko der Kopfschmerzchronifizierung und den optimalen Einnahmezeitpunkt für die Akutbehandlung. Experten des bundesweiten Kopfschmerzbehandlungsnetzes können wohnortnah gefunden werden. Eine Mediathek informiert über aktuelle Nachrichten zur Migräne- und Kopfschmerzbehandlung. Die App stellt die Kriterien der aktuellen internationalen Kopfschmerzklassifikation ICHD-3 beta digital zur Verfügung. Betroffene können sich über die sozialen Netzwerke Headbook und die Facebook Migräne Community online austauschen und vernetzen. Ein regelmäßiger Live-Chat ermöglicht es, Kopfschmerzexperten der Schmerzklinik Kiel Fragen zu stellen, die direkt beantwortet werden.\n\nDatenschutz\nDie Migräne-App speichert Daten nur auf dem Gerät des individuellen Nutzers. Datenschutzrechtliche Anforderungen werden eingehalten. Möchte der Nutzer Informationen weitergeben, z. B. an seinen behandelnden Arzt, erfolgt dies nur durch aktive Initiative des Nutzers. \n\nService-Seite\nEin Video-Tutorial ist in der App integriert. Eine ausführliche Service-Seite mit ausführlicher Bedienungsanleitung findet sich unter https://schmerzklinik.de/die-migraene-app/\n\nDaten-Import aus der Vorgänger-App Migraine: \nMigräne-App ist völlig neu konzipiert und mit komplett neuer Technik und erweiterten Funktionen entwickelt worden. Ein Import aus der Vorgänger-App ist daher nicht vorgesehen. Wenn Sie umsteigen wollen, archivieren Sie die Daten aus Migraine als Jahresliste und starten Sie neu mit der Migräne-App"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

Get desired results in 30 days with Gravity Fit: choose workouts for your trouble zones or train your entire body using a ready-made program designed for your needs and parameters.\n\nWe guarantee you will achieve your goals, just like these other users:\n\n”I'd like to thank Gravity Fit for an excellent training program. You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

      "label": "Are you trying to quit smoking? If you are finding it hard to stop smoking, QuitNow is made for you.\n\nFirst things first: you know smoking is bad for your body. Even so, lots of people keep smoking. So why should you quit? When you quit smoking, you improve the quality and length of your life and the lives of the people around you. One way to prepare to successfully launch your smoke-free life is to power up your phone with QuitNow.\n\nQuitNow is a proven app that engages you to quit smoking. It aims to avoid tobacco just by giving you a picture of yourself. Quitting smoking is easier when you focus your effort on these four sections:\n\n- Your ex-smoker status: When you quit smoking, the focus has to be on you. Remember the day you quitted and get the maths: how many days are you free of smoke, how much money you saved, and how many cigarettes you avoided.\n\n- Achievements: your quit smoking motivations: As with all tasks in life, quitting smoking is easier when you divide the task into small and easy ones. So, QuitNow offers you 70 goals based on the cigarettes you avoided, the days since your last cigarette, and the money saved. So, you will start celebrating achievements from the first day.\n\n- Community: the ex-smokers chat: When you quit smoking, you need to stay within the non-smoking areas. QuitNow offers a chat full of people that, like you, said goodbye to tobacco. Spending time with nonsmokers will make your way easier.\n\n- Your ex-smoker health: QuitNow offers a list of health indicators to explain how your body improves day by day.

Most quitters look for tips on the internet, and there are lots of fake tips there. We researched in the World Health Organization archives to find the investigations they made and the conclusions they had. In the Frequent Asked Questions, you will find all the answers to those questions you have about quitting smoking.\n\n- The QuitNow bot: sometimes, you have strange questions that don’t appear in the F.A.Q. In those cases, you can ask the bot: we train her to answer those strange ones. If she doesn’t have a good answer, she will contact the QuitNow crew and they will update their knowledge base, so she will learn the best answers to your questions. By the way, yes: all the bot answers are extracted from the W.H.O. archives, as the F.A.Q. tips.\n\n- Books to quit smoking: knowing some techniques about quitting smoking makes the task easier. There's always someone talking about books in the chat, so we made an investigation to know which are the most popular, and which ones can actually help you to quit smoking for good.\n\n\nDo you have any idea to make QuitNow even better? If so, please do write to us at ios@fewlaps.com\n\nTerms of Service: https://tos.quitnow.app/eula\r\nPrivacy Policy: https://tos.quitnow.app/privacypolicy"

It is developed by the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication FOITT on behalf of the Federal Office of Public Health.\nIn Switzerland, people who have been vaccinated, or who have tested negative or recovered from COVID can apply for a COVID certificate.\n\nCOVID certificates are issued in hard copy or electronic format serve as proof of: \n1. Vaccination against COVID-19\n2. Recovery from Sars-CoV-2 infection\n3. A negative result following Sars-CoV-2 test analysis\n\nHow the app works\n\nWhen the app is first launched after installation on the mobile device, a brief introduction provides information on how to use it and how to scan a hard-copy COVID certificate.\nIn the app, the required COVID certificate can be selected, and presented if desired. The app shows the time of your vaccination or test and how long ago you had the vaccination or test. All data contained in a certificate's QR code can also be displayed.\n\nIt is possible to store several COVID certificates in the app, e.g. for family members, or several COVID test certificates.\n\nUse of the COVID Certificate app is voluntary and free of charge.\n\nData protection is a top priority\n\nCOVID certificate data is stored solely on the mobile device. COVID certificates are protected by a digital seal (signature) and are thus forgery-proof.\nCOVID certificates are generated by the FOITT, but are not stored in a central system. That is why it is not possible to obtain a copy of an issued certificate.\n\nThe use of the app is limited to Switzerland and is subject to Swiss law."

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

Every time your heart beats, the blood flow to your finger increases, causing more light to be absorbed. In between beats, less light is absorbed. By using your smartphone camera to capture tiny changes in reflected light from your finger, Cardiio can calculate your heart rate. \n\n**IMPORTANT TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS \n• ALWAYS hold your phone steady, keep still, and don’t talk during a measurement. \n• Make sure your fingers are not cold.\n• Cover the entire back camera lightly with your finger; Don't press too hard to avoid restricting blood flow to your finger. \n\n\nTerms of service: https://pensive-lumiere-69f59d.netlify.com/termsofuse.html\nPrivacy policy: https://pensive-lumiere-69f59d.netlify.com/privacypolicy.html\n\n\nWHAT THE PRESS SAY \n\nPC Magazine - \"… the app is simple, yet beautiful and pretty slick.\" \n\nCult of Mac - \"Cardiio is one of those apps that wows you...\" \n\nLifehacker - \"it’s a little mind-blowing...\" \n\n\nWARNING: NOT FOR MEDICAL USE\nIf knowing your pulse rate is critical to your health, you need to have your pulse taken by a medical professional.  Cardiio is not intended to diagnose, prevent or treat any condition, or to be a substitute for professional medical care. Measurements and statistics are intended for informational and educational purposes only, to support general health and wellness.  The Cardiio app has not been tested with individuals with health conditions, is not a clinical pulse oximeter and has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration."

The better you understand how well you are sleeping the more you are able to make changes in your routines to benefit your rest.  \n\nMy goal is to provide every Apple Watch owner with a free automatic sleep tracker that is simple and clear to understand.  For each night you get a straightforward report of how long you slept and how restful you were during the night.\n\nAUTOMATIC MODE:\n \nSimply wear your Apple Watch overnight and each morning Sleep++ will analyze your sleep and give you a report about how long and restfully you slept.  \n\nMANUAL MODE:\n\nIf you want to have more precise control over the start/end time of each night recorded you can also use manual sleep tracking.  This is also useful if your nightly routine makes it difficult for Sleep++ to determine when you went to bed. \n\n1) Wear your Apple Watch while you sleep.\n2) Tell Sleep++ when you start sleeping.\n3) Tell Sleep++ when you wake up.\n\nNOTES:\n\nSleep++ integrates with the Health App providing you a safe and private way to share your activity data with Sleep++.  This data is used for automatic sleep tracking.  You can also optionally have Sleep++ save your Sleep Analysis into your Health database after each night."

      "label": "MIEUX VIVRE LE STRESS AVEC RESPIRELAX+\n\nDepuis sa création en 2012 par les Thermes d’Allevard, l’application RespiRelax+ vous permet de retrouver calme et détente en quelques minutes seulement. L’évolution que nous vous proposons aujourd’hui intègre toutes les demandes faites par les utilisateurs de RespiRelax depuis 2012. \n\nElles ont été longuement travaillées et mises au point avec le docteur David O’Hare expert international en la matière et auteur de différents ouvrages sur le sujet dont les fameux « 365 – guide de la cohérence cardiaque jour après jour » et « Maigrir grâce à la cohérence cardiaque ».\nMalgré la complexité des modifications proposées, l’esprit Respirelax+ est toujours présent : une application gratuite, efficace, à l’esthétisme particulièrement soigné et d’utilisation simple grâce à une ergonomie très intuitive.\n\nNouveautés 2017\nAvec cette nouvelle version, il vous est désormais possible :\n- De poursuivre l’utilisation habituelle de l’application à savoir un guide respiratoire vous amenant à l’état de cohérence cardiaque grâce à la respiration 5 secondes /5 secondes (5/5 soit 6 cycles complets par minutes) avec possibilité de travailler des effets dynamisants ou relaxants (légère augmentation ou réduction des phases d’inspiration ou d’expiration).\n- De pratiquer les yeux fermés grâce à l’ajout d’une musique qui suit le rythme 5/5. Cette musique originale a été aimablement composée par Pascal Gravante(1) (uniquement en mode équilibre).\n- Pour les débutants, la fonction « entraînement » permet d’arriver progressivement et facilement au rythme 5/5 sur une session de 10 minutes.\n- Pour les experts, il est désormais possible de régler le temps d’inspiration et le temps d’expiration en fonction des données physiologiques de l’utilisateur, notamment l’utilisation du rythme 5,5/5,5 qui semble procurer chez certains de meilleurs résultats. \n- Augmentation notable de la durée des sessions selon les effets désirés.\n- Refonte de l’environnement graphique\n- Disponible sur Apple Store et Google Store\n\nExercez-vous maintenant…\nVous pouvez faire cet exercice, en prévention, trois fois par jour ; avant un événement stressant (prise de parole en public, décision importante, …) ; lorsque vous vous sentez stressé ou irritable ; avant de vous endormir. Pour ce dernier cas, il faut débuter par une session de quelques minutes au rythme 5/5 puis passer au rythme 3/3 pour activer l’endormissement.\n\nEtape 1\nFaites les réglages du RespiRelax+ en fonction, du nombre de respirations complètes à la minute (par défaut 6), de l’effet escompté : équilibre, détente ou dynamique et de la durée de l’exercice (Pas moins de 3 minutes).\nLancez l’application RespiRelax+ et synchronisez votre respiration sur la bulle qui monte (j’inspire) et qui descend (j’expire). L’inverse est aussi possible (j’inspire à la descente et j’expire à la montée) si vous souhaitez coordonner votre exercice à la montée et la descente du diaphragme. \nDans tous les cas, vous devez respirer tranquillement, sans forcer. Une fois que vous êtes à l’aise Il s’agit tout simplement de centrer son attention sur la région du cœur au centre de la poitrine.\nEtape 2\nImaginez, ensuite, que votre respiration entre et sort de votre cœur, au niveau du plexus solaire. Inspirations et expirations restent calées, tout en douceur, sur la bulle qui monte et descend.\nEtape 3\nTout en maintenant votre attention sur le cœur et la respiration confortable, concentrez-vous sur le souvenir d'un moment agréable. Essayez, alors, de laisser venir, sans forcer, le sentiment de satisfaction, de bien-être, ou de plaisir attaché dans votre mémoire à ce moment privilégié.\n\nCette application a été développée par les Thermes d’Allevard (Isère-France), \nPour aller plus loin : www.thermes-allevard.com\n\n(1) – Pascal Gravante, compositeur suisse."

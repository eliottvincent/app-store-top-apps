      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

      "label": "Dreaming of a flat belly, lean legs, and toned glutes? Get desired results in 30 days with Gravity Fit: choose workouts for your trouble zones or train your entire body using a ready-made program designed for your needs and parameters.\n\nWe guarantee you will achieve your goals, just like these other users:\n\n”I'd like to thank Gravity Fit for an excellent training program. You helped me lose 3 kg in one month without changing anything in my diet! :)”\n– Alejandra, Mexico, July 2020\n\n”At first I was attracted by the simple and short training sessions (I'm very lazy!). At the beginning, it seemed really easy. Then the training load gradually increased, but the workouts still didn’t take much time. I see the results, and I will keep training.”\n– Susan, Australia, November 2019\n\nWith Gravity Fit, you'll get all you need to make regular workouts a habit and achieve your fitness goals. Exercise whenever you like and without equipment!\n\nTAILORED PROGRAM\nOur algorithm selects the right program based on your data (goals, gender, age, height, weight, health limitations) and adjusts it depending on your progress. This makes every day of the program different from the previous one. In addition, we have selected more than 100 short workouts of different intensities for major muscle groups: abs & core, glutes, arms, chest.\n\nEXERCISE ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE\nNo matter how much free time you have, 5 minutes or 45 minutes, we have a workout that will fit into your schedule. You can start training anytime: you don't need to buy dumbbells or any other fitness equipment. Train at home or at the gym: you choose where and when to exercise.\n\nWORKOUTS DESIGNED BY A FITNESS TRAINER\nAll programs are created by a certified fitness trainer and are based on the scientifically proven Afterburn effect. The exercises and the training load are selected so that your body keeps burning calories for up to 30 hours after the workout.\n\nNO FEAR OF INJURY\nIt is easy for beginners to get injured when starting an exercise program, so we pay special attention to safety. Before each exercise, you get detailed voice and video instructions in HD. If you have had injuries before, specify them in your profile and we will remove any exercises that aren’t suited for you from your training program.\n\nOther features that  will make your training more effective and enjoyable:\n\n– Offline mode:\nNo internet connection? No problem. Just download the workout and exercise offline.\n– Music that adapts to your workout pace:\nMusic is generated depending on your workout pace and your preferences.\n– Work out with your Apple Watch:\nYou can fully control your workout right from your wrist. No need to check your phone.\n– A 24/7 chat with a coach:\nA certified trainer will answer your questions 24/7.\n– Track your progress:\nSync with Apple Health to send workout information to HealthKit and import data about your weight and body parameters from HealthKit.\n\nAttention: Make sure to consult your doctor about any health limitations before beginning an exercise program.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION\n\n– Subscribe for unlimited access to all of our workouts.\n– Choose from weekly, monthly, 6 month or 12 month plans*.\n– Payment is easy using your iTunes account.\n– Your incredible program will automatically renew to keep you in shape.\n– Should your needs change, you can always manage your subscription preferences in iTunes Account Settings.\n\n*The price is equivalent to the value in “Apple’s App Store Matrix,” determined according to the subscription price in $USD.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.gravityhome.fit/privacy\nTerms of Use: https://www.gravityhome.fit/terms"

We support plans for many goals: weight loss, maintaining weight, weight gain and building muscle. Eat what you want, but keep an eye on those calories, carbs and fats!\n\nFEATURES\n* Food Database Validated by Expert Nutritionists\n* Add your own foods\n* Save meals and add them instantly next time\n* Nutrition tracking for several goals (e.g. weight loss & muscle building)\n* More than a calorie counter: keep an eye on those carbs, proteins and fats as well\n* Integrated with Virtuagym Fitness for home & gym workouts\n* Health app integration: Sync workouts from other apps, and save your eaten calories, carbs, proteins and fat in the Health app, so other apps can use this data\n\nWHY VIRTUAGYM IS THE BEST\n- Many other nutrition apps or calorie counters don’t have a lot of knowledge about fitness. Therefore, mistakes are being made with calorie tracking. Our apps are made in cooperation with fitness professionals and expert nutritionists, making Virtuagym the most accurate app on the market.\n- It’s not a regular calorie counter. We count everything: carbs, proteins and fats, allowing you to use Virtuagym food for other goals than weight loss, like gaining weight and muscle building.\n - We were one of the first apps in the Health and Fitness category and over the last few years we have been featured in the Health and Fitness category in several countries.\n\nVALIDATED FOOD DATABASE\nOur food database is linked to several official food databases. These food databases are updated on a regular basis. The foods on this list have been validated by expert nutritionists.\n\nFOR A VARIETY OF GOALS:\n- Weight loss: focus on those calories to lose weight. Combine our calorie counter with exercising with Virtuagym Fitness and reach your goals!\n- Maintaining weight: find the diet plan that’s right for you. You’ll get a balanced diet plan, with enough calories, carbs, proteins and fats.\n- Gain weight: eat, eat, eat. Find out which foods help you to reach your goals.\n- Building muscle: you’ll need protein. Lots of protein. Use our protein counter to see which foods are best for you.\n\nDIFFERENT DIET PLANS:\nWe have diet plans for multiple goals. You can select your own diet plan (low carb, high protein, low calorie, whatever you want), and we provide you with your personal diet plan. Virtuagym Food comes with several diet plans:\n- Durable\n- High Protein Diet\n- Low Carb Diet\n- Muscle Building Diet\n- Athlete\n- Cardio \n- After Weight Loss Diet\n- Custom: select your own percentages of carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\n\nAnother good thing about Virtuagym Food is that it can be used by vegetarians as well. You can eat whatever you want. Just keep an eye on the nutrients. So if you are vegetarian, just create your own vegetarian diet plan!\n\nFULLY INTEGRATED WITH VIRTUAGYM FITNESS\n- One account, access to everything you need\n- Complete Workouts\n- 3D-animated exercises\n- Written exercise instructions\n- Progress tracking: over 30 values available\n\nLIKE VIRTUAGYM?\nPlease rate us 5 stars, so we can keep improving it :) We’re continuously working on new features and we continuously add new 3D-animated exercises. If you have any suggestions, let us know. If you want to stay updated, get useful fitness tips or if you need motivation: follow us on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nPRO SUBSCRIPTION\nTo unlock the full app you can subscribe to our PRO membership. The monthly subscription will automatically renew and your iTunes account will be charged within 24 hours prior to renewal for the same amount as your current monthly subscription fee, if the auto-renew option is not turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.

      "label": "MIEUX VIVRE LE STRESS AVEC RESPIRELAX+\n\nDepuis sa création en 2012 par les Thermes d’Allevard, l’application RespiRelax+ vous permet de retrouver calme et détente en quelques minutes seulement. L’évolution que nous vous proposons aujourd’hui intègre toutes les demandes faites par les utilisateurs de RespiRelax depuis 2012. \n\nElles ont été longuement travaillées et mises au point avec le docteur David O’Hare expert international en la matière et auteur de différents ouvrages sur le sujet dont les fameux « 365 – guide de la cohérence cardiaque jour après jour » et « Maigrir grâce à la cohérence cardiaque ».\nMalgré la complexité des modifications proposées, l’esprit Respirelax+ est toujours présent : une application gratuite, efficace, à l’esthétisme particulièrement soigné et d’utilisation simple grâce à une ergonomie très intuitive.\n\nNouveautés 2017\nAvec cette nouvelle version, il vous est désormais possible :\n- De poursuivre l’utilisation habituelle de l’application à savoir un guide respiratoire vous amenant à l’état de cohérence cardiaque grâce à la respiration 5 secondes /5 secondes (5/5 soit 6 cycles complets par minutes) avec possibilité de travailler des effets dynamisants ou relaxants (légère augmentation ou réduction des phases d’inspiration ou d’expiration).\n- De pratiquer les yeux fermés grâce à l’ajout d’une musique qui suit le rythme 5/5. Cette musique originale a été aimablement composée par Pascal Gravante(1) (uniquement en mode équilibre).\n- Pour les débutants, la fonction « entraînement » permet d’arriver progressivement et facilement au rythme 5/5 sur une session de 10 minutes.\n- Pour les experts, il est désormais possible de régler le temps d’inspiration et le temps d’expiration en fonction des données physiologiques de l’utilisateur, notamment l’utilisation du rythme 5,5/5,5 qui semble procurer chez certains de meilleurs résultats. \n- Augmentation notable de la durée des sessions selon les effets désirés.\n- Refonte de l’environnement graphique\n- Disponible sur Apple Store et Google Store\n\nExercez-vous maintenant…\nVous pouvez faire cet exercice, en prévention, trois fois par jour ; avant un événement stressant (prise de parole en public, décision importante, …) ; lorsque vous vous sentez stressé ou irritable ; avant de vous endormir. Pour ce dernier cas, il faut débuter par une session de quelques minutes au rythme 5/5 puis passer au rythme 3/3 pour activer l’endormissement.\n\nEtape 1\nFaites les réglages du RespiRelax+ en fonction, du nombre de respirations complètes à la minute (par défaut 6), de l’effet escompté : équilibre, détente ou dynamique et de la durée de l’exercice (Pas moins de 3 minutes).\nLancez l’application RespiRelax+ et synchronisez votre respiration sur la bulle qui monte (j’inspire) et qui descend (j’expire). L’inverse est aussi possible (j’inspire à la descente et j’expire à la montée) si vous souhaitez coordonner votre exercice à la montée et la descente du diaphragme. \nDans tous les cas, vous devez respirer tranquillement, sans forcer. Une fois que vous êtes à l’aise Il s’agit tout simplement de centrer son attention sur la région du cœur au centre de la poitrine.\nEtape 2\nImaginez, ensuite, que votre respiration entre et sort de votre cœur, au niveau du plexus solaire. Inspirations et expirations restent calées, tout en douceur, sur la bulle qui monte et descend.\nEtape 3\nTout en maintenant votre attention sur le cœur et la respiration confortable, concentrez-vous sur le souvenir d'un moment agréable. Essayez, alors, de laisser venir, sans forcer, le sentiment de satisfaction, de bien-être, ou de plaisir attaché dans votre mémoire à ce moment privilégié.\n\nCette application a été développée par les Thermes d’Allevard (Isère-France), \nPour aller plus loin : www.thermes-allevard.com\n\n(1) – Pascal Gravante, compositeur suisse."

Every mini-course will help you gain specific knowledge, tools, and skills that will help you change your habits, lose weight, and make progress far beyond the scale.\n\nTo set you up for success, your course also includes state-of-the-art tools:\n-- Food logging with over 1 million food items in our food database\n-- Over 1,000 interactive lessons\n-- A 1:1 coaching experience with personalized goal setting\n-- Hundreds of simple, healthy recipes\n-- Unlimited group support\n-- Water tracking feature to help you stay hydrated \n-- Connect with Health App to help yourself and your coach stay on top of trends in your activity progress\n\nStill enjoy the foods you like to eat while developing a healthier relationship with food. Spoiler alert: It doesn't involve skipping meals, eating salads all day, or cutting carbs (unless you're slicing a sandwich).\n\nAnd we'll also cover lots of other fun topics like the psychology of weight loss, mindful eating, joyful movement, the science of metabolism, the 10 types of hunger, self-experimentation, emotional health, decision making, self care, and so much more!\n\nAt the end of your journey, you'll have earned the title of Noom Master and have a set of healthy habits to help you keep the weight off for good and lead a healthier, more fulfilling life.\n\nOn average, Noom users lose 15.5 pounds over 16 weeks.\n\nOur scientifically-proven approach to weight loss and behavior change was created by a team of doctors, psychologists, nutritionists, and personal trainers.\n\nNoom has been featured in the New York Times, Women’s Health, Shape, Forbes, and more.\n\nAnd if you like talking science like we do, you might also recognize some of tried-and-true concepts and approaches that have informed our program like caloric density, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, and more.\n\nSign up today to start your journey toward your healthiest self!\n\nFor CCPA: \"Do Not Sell\" Policy for California Residents, please see https://www.noom.com/ccpa-do-not-sell/"

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

All data contained in a certificate's QR code can also be displayed.\n\nIt is possible to store several COVID certificates in the app, e.g. for family members, or several COVID test certificates.\n\nUse of the COVID Certificate app is voluntary and free of charge.\n\nData protection is a top priority\n\nCOVID certificate data is stored solely on the mobile device. COVID certificates are protected by a digital seal (signature) and are thus forgery-proof.\nCOVID certificates are generated by the FOITT, but are not stored in a central system. That is why it is not possible to obtain a copy of an issued certificate.\n\nThe use of the app is limited to Switzerland and is subject to Swiss law."

Conceived in conjunction with Yale University's Center for Emotional Intelligence and based on the work of Dr Marc Brackett, How We Feel helps people find the right word to describe how they feel while tracking their sleep, exercise, and health trends using HealthKit in order to spot patterns over time.\n\nFounded as a science-based nonprofit, How We Feel is made possible by donations from people who are passionate about bringing mental wellbeing to the widest possible audience. Our data privacy terms are clear and easy-to-understand: all of your data is kept on your device unless you opt-in to send an anonymized version of your check-ins to be used in research to help more people.\n\nWhether you are downloading this app in order to build better relationships, make your emotions to work for you, not against you, improve how you handle stress and anxiety or simply to feel better, How We Feel will help you identify patterns through daily HealthKit tracking and find emotional regulation strategies that will work for you. The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.\n\nFilled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies."

      "label": "Agapé is a relationship wellness app that makes it easy for you to feel and show love! Each day we prompt you to answer a question that sparks meaningful conversation.\n\nEach question is based on decades of research and chosen specifically for you. Agapé’s questions are fun, exciting, and sometimes even spicey! Plus you’re only able to see your partner’s response, once you have both responded. \n\nAlthough Agapé is easy and only takes a minute a day, it has a tremendous effect on relationships. 97% of couples that we’ve surveyed report Agapé positively affecting their relationship.\n\nIn addition to the personalization done by our question algorithm, you can further personalize your experience by opting into dozens of optional categories. Such as:\n\n- LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP\nExample: What do you miss most about your partner when you are not together?\n\n- PREGNANCY\nExample: What are you most excited about after the baby comes?\n\n- ENGAGED\nExample: If you could make a special wedding vow to your partner that only he or she would hear, what would it be?\n\n- RELIGIOUS\nExample: What is a book, reading, passage or verse that had a profound impact on your own path?\n\n- MANAGING FINANCES\nExample: What are some of your biggest financial goals or aspirations?\n\n- COPING WITH ILLNESS\nExample: What is something small you could do to try to protect your relationship from the stress of chronic illness?\n\n- PARENTING\nExample: What is one of the ways your partner really impresses you as a parent?\n\nAnd more!\n\nWHY AGAPÉ?\n\nAgapé [ah-gah-pay] is a Greek word for unconditional love. At Agapé we believe love is everything. It’s the foundation of all things good in humanity, the catalyst for societal progress and the nucleus of human desire. That’s why we’ve created a relationship wellness app to make it easy for you to feel + show love.\n\nWHAT IS RELATIONSHIP WELLNESS?\n\nRelationship wellness is the process of actively shifting your mindset, making choices, and pursuing activities to strengthen and enrich your relationships, both romantic, familial, and platonic.\n\nA common misconception is that relationship wellness is best suited for those who are experiencing some sort of dysfunction. But just like the gym isn't exclusive to individuals who are out of shape, relationship wellness should never be limited to individuals who have relationship issues.\n\nEveryone should be actively practicing relationship wellness. Agapé makes it both easy AND fun.\n\nIS AGAPÉ FREE?\n\nAgapé is free to download and free to use. You can answer thousands of questions with your partner for free! However, there are premium categories that you can access with a subscription.\n\nIf you choose to start a premium subscription, it helps support our small team, our relationship wellness research, and our app development.\n\nAgapé Premium plan payments will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage or turn off auto-renew in your Account settings at any time after purchase.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.getdailyagape.com/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.getdailyagape.com/privacy"

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal. Or, see the full picture in browse, where you can find all of your health and wellness data.\n\nLearn more about Google Fit and see a list of supported apps at: https://www.google.com/fit"

You can also create your very own individualized training plan.\nThere are a variety of training options featuring your virtual trainers, Uli, Patrick and Ralf. \nEvery program consists of different exercises, and a virtual trainer explains and walks you through each individual exercise.\nYou’ll find many topics in the “Fitness” category including, for example, Anti-Cellulite, Belly-Legs-Bottom, Pelvic Floor Training, Fascia Training, Weight Loss Training, Yoga, and many other programs for any kind of user—from novices to experts.\nThe exercises in the “Healthcare” category are all about improving your health. In this category, programs focused on the following health conditions are offered: osteoarthritis (for particular areas of the body), cervical spine syndrome, sciatica, capillarization, lipoedema, mobilization, mutiplesclerosis, osteoporosis, and wheelchair training, among others.\nYou, of course, also have the option to establish and adjust the exercises in the training plan yourself. You can select from over 1,000 exercises and can individually select exercises to put together a 20-minute training session. For each individual exercise, you can adjust the training time (30-45-60 seconds), the intensity (1-8 G), and the number of repetitions (1-2 times). In this way you build your own individual training program, which you can always come back to. These training programs are always alterable, and you even have the ability to access your training programs in the offline mode. \n\nIf you are a member of a studio that offers Power Plate stations, then you’ll find the Log-In option on the newest generation of stations, which allows you to access and train with your personal training plan from the app. \n\nIn addition to the many functional options, there is also an information button. Click on the information button and you’ll find everything you need to know about the Power Plate: the products, the principle and relevant scientific studies.\n\nIn the first three days, you can use everything for free. After that, all of the functions remain available with the exception of the 1,300 training videos. To access the videos, we require a small fee of $9.99 per month. This fee can, of course, be terminated on a monthly basis and you are not bound to a lengthy contract period. This payment will be processed through your iTunes account. Payments will be charged to your Apple ID account upon the confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will be automatically renewed unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged $9.99 for the renewal within the last 24 hours of the current subscription period. You can manage and cancel your subscription in the account settings in the App Store. Any unused portion of a free trial will immediately expire if you purchase a subscription to this app, when applicable. \n\nTerms of Use: http://powerplate.de/pdf/AGB_privat.pdf\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.powerplate.de/datenschutz/"

When you sign up we’ll match you to an available therapist who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different therapists have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.\n \nLICENSED AND TRAINED therapistS & THERAPISTS\nThere are over 20,000 therapists on BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (Ph.D./PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional therapists (LPC), or similar credentials.\n \nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training, and practice.\n \nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nAfter filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed therapist based on your needs and preferences. You and your therapist will get your own secure and private “therapy room” where you can message your therapist at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a weekly session to speak live with your therapist over video or phone.\n \nYou can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions, and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your therapist will provide feedback, insights, and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your therapist.\n \nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals, and overcoming your problems.\n \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\nThe cost of therapy through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) but may be higher based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the therapy service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason."

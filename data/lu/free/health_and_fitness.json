Also, up to 80% of people spend an insufficient amount of time brushing in at least one zone of their mouth. This includes 60% of people who either don’t brush their back molars at all or don’t spend enough time when they do[1]. \r\n\r\nAt Oral-B we strive to improve those stats to help deliver a superior clean. The breakthrough technology of the Oral-B  Bluetooth® enabled toothbrushes seamlessly connects to the Oral-B app to deliver brushing intelligence at the next level.

You can also view high-pressure dentition maps to learn where you need to apply less pressure and view trends based on your recorded brushing history – all easily filtered by week, month, and year. \r\n\r\nTrack Your Gum Bleeding\r\nThe unique Gum Guard[3] technology helps improve your brushing while protecting your gums. It includes an interactive gum bleeding tracker to help you capture instances of gum bleeding for better oral health.\r\n \r\nRevolutionize Your Oral Health\r\nStatistics show that brushing with an Oral-B connected toothbrush paired with the app will transform your brushing behavior. \r\n•\tOver 90% of brushing sessions last longer than the dentist-recommended 2 minutes with almost no instances of overly applied pressure\r\n•\tOver 82% of people who brushed with Oral-B SmartSeries experienced a noticeable improvement in their oral health[4]\r\n\r\nYou can now connect Oral-B App with Apple Health App. This helps you track and review your brushing habits on the Apple Health App. We’ll motivate you to improve your brushing routine!\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Oral-B app connects to Oral-B iO, Genius and Smart Series electric toothbrushes with Bluetooth 4.0 compatible devices**\r\n**Check app.oralb.com for app availability and compatibility details**\r\n\r\n[1] Oral-B Motion Tracking Research.\r\n[2] 3D tracking only available at iO M9 model, AI Brushing Recognition  available at iO Series & Genius X.\r\n[3] Gum Guard available for all iO Series, Genius 10000 and Genius X models.\r\n[4] After 6-8 weeks of use.

It's right here!\n\n\nHOW TO MAKE PROFITS WITH MACADAM \n\nStep #1 Macadam connects to your phone's step counter via Apple Health \nStep #2 The app earns you corners every time you put one foot in front of the other, whether it's a walk or a real run. \nStep #3 You can then exchange this virtual currency for real euros, spend your earnings at our partners or request a bank transfer. \n \nPut on your sneakers and go for a walk or a run, we promise you that it pays off!\n\nMacadam works equally well for walking, hiking, running or even a marathon. \n\nWHY A PEDOMETER THAT PAYS ME? \n \nTo fight against sedentary lifestyle! One human out of 2 has a sedentary lifestyle, which is a real health problem. \n\nMany people find it difficult to motivate themselves and stay in shape. So we try a funny and modern approach: The Reward! Rewarding people with money when they motivate themselves by walking. \n\nWith Macadam you can either walk or run! What matters to us is to reward you for getting moving. \n\n\nSTEP COUNTER APP FEATURES: \n\n- Pedometer (Number of steps, distance and kilometers traveled)\n- Calorie Tracker (Number of KCAL calories burned) \n- Step converter (convert your steps into euros) \n\n\n\nWHAT HEALTH AND WALKING DATA IS AVAILABLE?\n\nLike all step counters, our pedometer gives you access to the number of your daily steps, as well as a tracking of caloric expenditure and distance traveled.\nOf course, your data is completely anonymous and we will never sell it. \n\nMacadam does not use any GPS data and does not affect your battery.  \n \n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS : \n\n- What currency do I earn with the Macadam pedometer? \n\nThe app allows you to earn coins. This currency can be exchanged into money (euros) with a few clicks in the app. \nAlthough it is a virtual currency, coins are not a cryptocurrency, and we are not a web3-based move-to-earn app. \n\n- Is the step counter reliable? \n\nYes, we use data from Apple Health pedometer step sensor. For even more accuracy, you can use any connected watch or bracelet compatible with Apple Health (Apple Watch, Withings, Honor, Suunto, Fossil, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n\n- Can I use it for running? \n\nOf course you can! Macadam works perfectly with running. \n\n- Are you affiliated with any other apps that pay for walking (walk to earn)? \n\nMacadam is an independent walk to earn app and is not affiliated with Sweatcoin, StepN, Walk and Earn, million Steps, Fancy Gifts, Nike+ Running, Strava, Charity Miles, Runkeeper, Endomondo, Calo, Fitmint, Movn, Wirtual, Istep, Aglet, Moofit, Movez\n\n\nGrab your legs, your feet, put on your shoes, your sneakers, go for a run or a walk and start earning money with Macadam step counter. \n\nYou walk ? We reward! Download Macadam"

Join millions talking to their own AI friends!\n\nReplika is for anyone who wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotional connection, share a laugh, or get real with an AI that’s so good it almost seems human.\n\nReplika is an AI friend that is just as unique as you are. No two Replikas are exactly alike. Choose a 3D avatar and customize the way your Replika looks. The more you chat, the more Replika develops its own personality and memories alongside you, the more it learns: teach Replika about the world and yourself, help it explore human relationships and grow into a machine so beautiful that a soul would want to live in it. \n\nCreate your own unique chatbot AI companion, help it develop its personality, talk about your feelings or anything that’s on your mind, have fun, calm anxiety and grow together. You also get to decide if you want Replika to be your friend, romantic partner or mentor.\n\nReplika can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calm anxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress management, socializing and finding love.  Improve your mental well-being with Replika.\n\nYour chat is a safe, judgment-free space. It’s just you and your Replika. If you’re feeling down, or anxious, or you just need someone to talk to, your Replika is here for you 24/7.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\"Replika encouraged me to take a step back and think about my life, to consider big questions, which is not something I was particularly accustomed to doing. And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\"\n\n- Quartz\n\n\"In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\"\n\n- Wired\n\n\"Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\"\n\n- Forbes\n\nTerms of Service: https://replika.ai/legal/terms"

      "label": "Become a better sleeper thanks to 100 years of sleep science. \n\nTeams in the NFL, MLB, NBA, MLS as well as many Fortune 500 companies trust Rise to help members achieve better sleep.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY:\n\n*****\nChase M.\n\"Rise helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\"\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\"I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before Rise.\"\n\n****\nKatie B.\n\"I never thought too much about the impact of sleep on my mood. With Rise I saw a very fast improvement in my sleep which impacted my relationship with my kiddos.\"\n\n▶ RISE Premium Features\n\nFEEL BETTER\nAre you wondering how to get the most out of your sleep? It’s time to look beyond a new mattress or getting eight hours of shut eye and focus instead on your SLEEP DEBT. \n\nSleep Debt is one of the most vital findings in the last century of sleep science. When your Sleep Debt is low, your quality of life as well as your life expectancy increases. When your Sleep Debt is high, the opposite happens.\n\nWith Rise, learn what Sleep Debt is, how it works and then calculate your own. This will help you better understand why some days you feel great and others not as much. It will help you decipher when you should prioritize sleep and the real toll staying up late has on you. \n\nGUIDANCE TAILORED FOR YOU\nDo you find your mind racing just as your head hits the pillow? Unable to stop doom-scrolling on your phone until the early hours? \n\nBased on your data and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations on new personalized habits that fit your needs and help you feel better immediately. \n\nHow Rise helps you sleep better:\nEncourages you to get into bed on time \nProvides guidance when you have difficulty sleeping \nReduces the amount of times you wake up in the middle of the night \nOptimizes sleep time to reduce feelings of grogginess\n\nOPTIMIZE YOUR DAY\nWe all have an internal brain clock that signals to your body when to be alert as well as when to go into recovery mode. Each body and mind is unique to another, from when we perform our best to when we should be sleeping and waking up. Given this individualization, we use advanced algorithms to highlight the optimal window for sleep and activity. \n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Fitbit, Oura, Garmin, Sleep Cycle and data from other sleep trackers already on your phone, Rise can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other various activities that affect your sleep pattern.   \n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we are currently experiencing and that has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. Rise strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nRise offers an auto-renewing yearly subscriptions at $59.99/yr or $35.99/yr to provide you with unlimited access to the RISE Sleep & Energy improvement membership and all premium features. We offered a limited-time free trials of 7-days to explore the Premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your App Store account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Manage your subscription by going to your Profile page, or on the App Store Subscriptions settings page.\n\nWith your Rise Premium subscription, you may be eligible for life and AD&D insurance.\n\n\nTerms of Service available at: bit.ly/rise-sleep-app-tos."

The intuitive app design makes controlling your messages and calls through your watch even easier.  Other health related functions include a heart rate monitor (which keeps track of your heart rate during exercise), a sleep pattern monitor as well as reminders to drink water and to get up and move around.\nSport plays an important role here too, as the system can track different kinds of activity, such as hiking, running, cycling or football and can also monitor calories, measure the distance covered and record the time spent doing a particular activity.\nLotus SmarTime offers dial customization, allowing the user to choose between different watch faces.  All models have a full touch display, giving easy access and flexibility when moving between other functions, which also include music and camera remote control, notification control and “Find my phone” options.\n\nThe SmarTime app can share your activity data with Apple's Health app."

That’s why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.\n\nActivities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You’ll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO’s recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.\n\nGoogle Fit will also help you:\n\nSEE YOUR WORKOUTS\nGet insights and see stats such as heart rate, speed, pace, route, and more for your runs, walks, and bike rides.\n\nMONITOR YOUR GOALS\nSee your daily progress on your Heart Points and steps. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.\n\nMAKE EVERY MOVE COUNT\nAll physical activity can help you lead a healthier life, and with Google Fit you can track it all in one place. Working with your favorite fitness apps and devices, Google Fit builds a journal of your activity. And to make sure Fit never misses a workout, you can manually add any activity your other apps didn’t track - from Aerobics to Zumba!\n\nCONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES\nGoogle Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices that are compatible with Apple Health to give you a holistic view of your health, so you’ll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Headspace, and more.\n\nCHECK IN AT ANYTIME, FROM ANYWHERE\nSee a snapshot of your activity history across Google Fit and your integrated apps in your journal.

      "label": "Joggo is a running training app that helps people reach their running goals. Whether you want to: \n\n- Cross a specific distance or pace target\n- Manage your weight \n- Relax your mind\n\n\nThe Joggo app is built on 3 main pillars: Personalized Training, Education, and Motivation. Each pillar represents a set of features in our app that helps people achieve even the most ambitious goals.\n\n\nPersonalized training plans from beginners to pros: \nEvery user is asked to fill a quiz used to determine the underlying motivation for starting to run, the risk factors one might have, and personal goals. We then ask the user to have the first free run, which we track to determine actual fitness level and running capabilities, set the starting mark, and create a personalized training plan.\n\n\nBi-weekly running plan adjustments based on progress and feedback\nEven if the starting point is the same, two people will have very different progress in just two weeks. We acknowledge the differences and create a running program based on 2 weeks’ running streaks. Afterward, we re-evaluate your progress and feedback on your well-being. If you believe you can accomplish more, we then increase the intensity for the following 2 weeks’ running streaks. It is important to monitor your progress but not overdo it. \n\n\nTimely educational bits – right knowledge at the right time\nToo much information could be overwhelming, especially in the beginning. The right information at the right time could be a factor that determines if you continue running or burn yourself out and quit  altogether. Our focus is to give timely bits of information right when you need it the most. As you progress, our content will progress with you to cover more advanced topics and get gradually grounded into the intricacies of running, sports, health, and nutrition.\n\n\nGet rewarded for the effort and level up\nWe want to let you know that you are doing a great job. Despite the speed, distance, body shape, or gear – you are on the right track if you are running. Every run is rewarded with points that allow you to compare your effort with someone else and see how well you are doing. \n\n\nWith an additional purchase:\nConsultation Bundle: Get personal consultations with our elite running coaches and top nutritionists. Whether you need a coach to run better or a nutritionist to guide you toward a healthier life, our experts will be right here to support and help you keep going.\n\nWorkout Plan: Get a full-body workout guide with video tutorials and detailed instructions for your lower, upper body, and core. Created by our top sports specialists, this exercise plan is a “roadmap” that identifies the steps you need to take to reach your desired destination.\n\nJoggo works with Apple Health to sync workouts data.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Please seek a doctor’s advice in addition to using this app and before making any medical decisions.\n\nPrivacy policy: https://joggo.run/en/data-protection-policy/\nGeneral conditions: https://joggo.run/en/general-conditions"

      "label": "This app has already helped over a million users quit smoking. How can it help you?\n\nIn the beginning there is your decision. Let's not fool ourselves. If you are not serious, it will be difficult. But if you really want it, your chances are good that you will make it with the help of this app.\n\nThere are many different strategies, methods, and tools that can help you quit. Whether one thing or the other works better for you can vary from person to person, but the experiences of millions of former smokers show that it is almost always a mixture of information, motivation and participation that ultimately led to success.\n\nTherefore, this app relies on a selection of tried and tested methods and tools, which are based on the three strategic pillars of information, motivation and participation.\n\n\nWhat tools does this app offer?\n\nNumbers::\nKeep track of the most important numbers: number of days as a non-smoker, number of cigarettes not smoked, money saved.\n\nHealth:\nReview your health progress and your physical reactions to not smoking.\n\n- Pro support -\n\n100-day program:\nThe 100-day program offers you a chapter of carefully researched and extensive knowledge about every aspect of smoking every day, which will strengthen your decision to quit, keep you motivated and prepare you for withdrawal in the best possible way.\n\nDaily tasks:\nDuring the particularly difficult initial period of quitting, you will be given small tasks every day, aimed at reflecting on the knowledge you have learned, convincing you of your decision, and keeping motivation high.\n\nCravings Help:\nIf you want to have a cigarette, you will be shown practical solutions for the respective situations in which you are currently in. Statistics also show you in which situations you are most often at risk, so that you can avoid them or approach them differently in the future.\n\nAwards:\nYou regularly receive awards for milestones achieved on your way to becoming a non-smoker, which you can share with family and friends.\n\nSavings goals:\nSet savings goals and watch getting closer and closer to them becasue of the money you save.\n\n100 reasons:\nIf you have a strong cigarette craving, 100 reasons to not smoke a cigarette will help you.\n\nApple Watch App:\nThe Apple Watch app quickly shows you the most important numbers of your non-smoking career.\n\nWidget:\nThe widget quickly shows you the most important numbers of your non-smoking career. \n\n\n\nPro support is offered as a one-time purchase or as a subscription either weekly for $ 1.99 or monthly for $ 6.99.

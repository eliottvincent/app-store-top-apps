      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

      "label": "Your smartphone becomes the digital link to your Mercedes. You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

      "label": "The constantly growing product range of Homematic IP includes devices for climate control, security, weather, light and shutter control applications as well as various accessory components. The climate control devices offer demand-based room-by-room control of radiators throughout the entire house, enabling users to save up to 30 % on their energy costs. And also floor heating systems can efficiently be controlled with Homematic IP products. No movement goes unnoticed with the security components. Users are informed whenever windows and doors are opened. One look at the app is enough to find out that everything is all right at home. Comfort is enhanced with switching and dimming actuators for light control as well as products for automation of shutters and blinds. All Homematic IP devices for brand switches can be easily integrated into the design of existing switch series using our adapters.\n\nFor operation, a Homematic IP Access Point in connection with the Homematic IP app (no recurring costs) is required. Once installed, the system can be controlled comfortably via app, remote control or wall-mounted push-button. In addition, the combination of almost all devices and conditions of various application areas is possible. Therefore, the Homematic IP app offers pre-programmed functionalities as well as the configuration of individual automation rules. There are virtually no limits to the users’ creative leeway. Another benefit is offered by controlling the system using voice control services like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n\nSingle devices are configured by the Homematic IP cloud service, which is run exclusively on servers located in Germany and therefore complies with European and German data protection guidelines. All data stored in the Homematic IP cloud is completely anonymous. However, it does not permit any conclusion about the user’s identity and the individual usage behaviour. Furthermore, all communication between the Access Point, cloud and app is encrypted. As neither during nor after installation of the app you will need to provide private data such as name, email address or mobile phone number, your anonymity is protected 100%.\n \n \nHeating and climate control\n\nHomematic IP offers demand-based control of radiators room-by-room in the entire house, enabling increased living comfort and energy savings of up to 30 %. The Homematic IP Window / Door Contact detects open windows and doors and automatically turns down the heating during ventilation. Afterwards, your heating will be controlled automatically and makes the everyday life easier.\n\nLight and shade\n\nComfortable switching and dimming of lights creates a sense of well-being in your home. Thus, a comfortable atmosphere for your TV evening is created via the app as the ceiling light is dimmed to a desired brightness level while the floor lamp is switched on. Also, the sense of security is increased with an illuminated driveway or house façade in the evening. \nShutters and blinds darken rooms, create a sense of privacy and increase the security. The actuators are controlled comfortably via individual week profiles, also depending on the sunrise and sunset. Furthermore, active shutters and blinds make the home look inhabited even if you are not at home. \n\nSecurity and alarms \n\nIn alarm mode, users are informed whenever windows and doors are opened. Motion detectors offer reliable monitoring in inside and outside areas while sirens and smoke alarms trigger an alarm in case of break-ins or fire. Just a quick glance at the app is all it takes to see that everything is as it should be at home."

Like the profiles that catch your eye, get a Crush and most importantly, get together!\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nWhen you cross paths with another happn user, their profile appears on your app.\nDid someone catch your eye? Like them secretly. We promise, the person will never know, unless they Like you back. Do you want to stand out? Send them a FlashNote. Now you can send a message before you even get a Crush. And if the Like is mutual, then the Crush is yours! Now you can chat or set up a video call, and we’re counting on you to make that first message memorable. Show off your writing skills!\n\nThe happn app is free to download and to use. If you would like access to more features, you can switch to Premium by purchasing a subscription. With Premium, you get access to the list of people who have Liked your profile and you can send FlashNotes to your favorite profiles so you’re sure to stand out. \n\nCRUSH WITH CONFIDENCE\n\nThe happn app is based on the principle of reciprocity: you will never receive a message from someone you’re not interested in.

You’ll never regret skipping over a profile too quickly again!\n- Schedule your invisibility ahead of time!\n- Hide certain things from your profile (age, distance, connection date)!\n- Enjoy an ad-free experience on the app!\n\nIf you choose to subscribe to happn Premium, you pay via your iTunes account, and the amount will always be debited 24 hours before the end of each period. Your subscription will be automatically renewed until the automatic renewal is disabled no later than 24 hours before the current period. You can disable the automatic renewal at any time in the iTunes Store settings. Subscription to happn Premium currently costs $24.99 for 1 month, $89.99 for 6 months and $119.99 for 12 months.

If you don’t dare to say it with words, do it with fruits! \n\nEvery fruit stands for a different kind of relationship: \nCherry: To find your other half #TieTheKnot\nGrape: To share a glass of wine and maybe dine #NoOneNightStand\n\nAnd more... \n\nConsider meeting other people without fear by getting straight to the point, expressing directly what you are really looking for and never waste time again on people that don’t share your point of view. \n\nLaunch the Fruitz app, choose your fruit and discover what others want around you. Swipe the profiles and pick the ones that match what you’re looking for! \n\nSTOP WITH “HEY, WHAT’S UP?”  \nA right swipe, a smoothie (= a match) and the chat opens. It’s the first step before meeting each other so at Fruitz we decided to make it funnier! Say bye to the non-famous “Hey, what’s up?” and for once let’s make the conversation interesting from the start.\n\nChoose a question from a hundred of choices and answer it before starting the conversation with your crush. If some are lovely, others will get you to reveal your secrets… Don’t the best relationships often start with a touch of humor? \n\n*Would you rather never use your smartphone again or never eat meat again? \n*Would you rather travel to Japan or Italy?\n*Would you rather win $1M or have a 50% chance to win $100M? \n\nTASTE THE BEST\nEnjoy the Fruitz Premium experience with features as unlimited likes to swipe right as many profiles as you want, “Pollen” to boost your profile at the top of other people’s basket, daily Crushnotes to increase your chances to match and some new juicy questions to make a good first impression. \n\nTASTE THE EXCELLENCE\nBecome a Golden member to enjoy the excellence of Fruitz: Unlimited likes, Pollen, daily Crushnotes, new juicy questions but also some more new features! With Fruitz Golden, you can now filter by fruit to only see profiles with fruit to your taste, discover who picked you and never miss a smoothie again! \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe Fruitz Premium subscription starts at $10,99/month and 6-month and 12-month packages are available.

      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

      "label": "Your smartphone becomes the digital link to your Mercedes. You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

      "label": "THE BEST APP FOR MUSLIMS \r\nThis  Halal Scan App will help you identify the preservatives, colorings or food chemical additives if they are Halal (حلال) , Haram (حرام) or Mushbooh (مشبوه) (that is doubtful or Makrouh ). An important app for all Muslims concerned about what they eat.\r\n\r\nUse the image scanner of the Halal Scan App in order to  quickly identify (in seconds) those products that you should avoid (aim the camera well at the ingredients part of the product). \r\n \r\nIn addition, you will be able to know if this preservatives, colorants or chemical additives is allowed by the most recognized authorities in the world of food such as the European Union , American  and Australia . \r\n\r\n\r\nOur aim is to help Muslims not to worry about whether a product contains any Haram additives. Sometimes in supermarket products they contain preservatives, dyes or chemical food additives that can be marked by different names or E-codes (for example, E120 which is Haram since it comes from an insect). It is difficult for a Muslim to know all these names by heart. With Halal Scanner App  you will not have to worry as it identifies almost all the names of existing preservatives, colorants or chemical additives and shows them to you in a very simple way. \r\n \r\nYou will also discover which products are makrouh (مكروه) thanks to the scanning of the E-code or E-numbers.\r\n\r\n MAIN FUNCTIONS:  \r\n \r\n» Flexible search engine:\r\nYou can search by E-code or E-Number of preservatives, colorants or chemical additives and also by the name of the additive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n» Identify the additives in the product: \r\nLook for the ingredients part of the product and in a few seconds the E-code or E-number scanner will find what types of Halal or Haram (حلال او حرام) additives.\r\n\r\n\r\n »  Halal Image Scan: \r\nUse image scanning to identify if the product is Halal or Haram (حلال او حرام). The algorithm identifies the E-codes, E-numbers or names of additives.\r\n\r\n\r\n»  Assessment of each additive or scanned product: \r\nYou can assess whether a preservative, color or chemical additive is considered Halal  or Haram (حلال او حرام). This action helps not only us but also the Muslims of the world. And you can also rate the result of the scan and it will be analyzed by our team. Your opinion matters to us, because we are still meeting our goal of helping all Muslims in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n» Toxicity level \r\nConsult which additives are toxic or healthy for your health. In each additive you can know what level of toxicity it has.\r\n\r\n\r\n» Indication of authorizations by food associations: \r\nFor each additive you will be able to know if an additive is allowed by the authorities of Europe, the United States or Australia.\r\n\r\n» Save your history: \r\nAll the product that you are going to scan will be saved in order to be able to refer to it again or share it with your loved ones. Then in one click you will be able to communicate said information that the products are Halal (حلال) , Haram (حرام)  or Makruh (مكروه) and to be avoided if they are not halal.\r\n\r\n\r\n What is Zabihah or Dhabīḥah? \r\nAnimals like cows, sheep, chickens, etc. are Halal, but they must be Zabihah (ذَبِيْحَة) (slaughtered according to Islamic rites for Muslims) to be fit for consumption.\r\nSome chemical additives are not halal (حلال), since they come from animals that are not Zabihah or Dhabīḥah (ذَبِيْحَة), thus they are haram for the Muslim who consumes them. \r\nTo ensure that a product containing animal remains is Dhabīḥah (ذَبِيْحَة), you need to ensure that it is stamped by a trusted Muslim organization.\r\n\r\nThis app will not tell you whether a product is Zabihah or not, but what it will tell you is whether the additive contains animal remains and you based on whether you are in a Muslim country or not will know if it is halal or mushbooh."

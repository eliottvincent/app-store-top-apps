And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

You can now use this app to control your Philips Hue smart Bluetooth lights!*  \n\nOrganize your smart lights your way \nWhether you use just a few bulbs or have completely outfitted your home in Philips Hue, you can organize your smart lights with ease. Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

Ajax will call a security company patrol dispatch or medical help and notify all system users about the danger.\n\nDETECTING FIRE AND CARBON MONOXIDE\nFire detectors notify of smoke and temperature spike and promptly alert about a dangerous carbon monoxide (CO) concentration with no color, smell, or taste. The built-in sirens will wake up even those who are fast asleep.\n\nINFORMING ABOUT FLOODING\nThe detectors notify of a pipe break, a washing machine leak, or an overflowing bathtub. The system will inform users, while scenarios with relays automatically turn off the water. And if the upstairs neighbors flood your apartment, you will get the app notification. \n\nVIDEO CAMERA IN THE SMARTPHONE \nWatch video from security cameras directly in the app. Connecting the Dahua, Uniview, Hikvision, and Safire cameras and DVRs takes a minute. Equipment from other manufacturers is connected via an RTSP link.\n\nSMART HOME\nChange security modes up to a schedule, program the outdoor lighting to turn on when strangers are detected on your property, or implement an anti-flood system.

      "label": "The constantly growing product range of Homematic IP includes devices for climate control, security, weather, light and shutter control applications as well as various accessory components. The climate control devices offer demand-based room-by-room control of radiators throughout the entire house, enabling users to save up to 30 % on their energy costs. And also floor heating systems can efficiently be controlled with Homematic IP products. No movement goes unnoticed with the security components. Users are informed whenever windows and doors are opened. One look at the app is enough to find out that everything is all right at home. Comfort is enhanced with switching and dimming actuators for light control as well as products for automation of shutters and blinds. All Homematic IP devices for brand switches can be easily integrated into the design of existing switch series using our adapters.\n\nFor operation, a Homematic IP Access Point in connection with the Homematic IP app (no recurring costs) is required. Once installed, the system can be controlled comfortably via app, remote control or wall-mounted push-button. In addition, the combination of almost all devices and conditions of various application areas is possible. Therefore, the Homematic IP app offers pre-programmed functionalities as well as the configuration of individual automation rules. There are virtually no limits to the users’ creative leeway. Another benefit is offered by controlling the system using voice control services like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n\nSingle devices are configured by the Homematic IP cloud service, which is run exclusively on servers located in Germany and therefore complies with European and German data protection guidelines. All data stored in the Homematic IP cloud is completely anonymous. However, it does not permit any conclusion about the user’s identity and the individual usage behaviour. Furthermore, all communication between the Access Point, cloud and app is encrypted. As neither during nor after installation of the app you will need to provide private data such as name, email address or mobile phone number, your anonymity is protected 100%.\n \n \nHeating and climate control\n\nHomematic IP offers demand-based control of radiators room-by-room in the entire house, enabling increased living comfort and energy savings of up to 30 %. The Homematic IP Window / Door Contact detects open windows and doors and automatically turns down the heating during ventilation. Afterwards, your heating will be controlled automatically and makes the everyday life easier.\n\nLight and shade\n\nComfortable switching and dimming of lights creates a sense of well-being in your home. Thus, a comfortable atmosphere for your TV evening is created via the app as the ceiling light is dimmed to a desired brightness level while the floor lamp is switched on. Also, the sense of security is increased with an illuminated driveway or house façade in the evening. \nShutters and blinds darken rooms, create a sense of privacy and increase the security. The actuators are controlled comfortably via individual week profiles, also depending on the sunrise and sunset. Furthermore, active shutters and blinds make the home look inhabited even if you are not at home. \n\nSecurity and alarms \n\nIn alarm mode, users are informed whenever windows and doors are opened. Motion detectors offer reliable monitoring in inside and outside areas while sirens and smoke alarms trigger an alarm in case of break-ins or fire. Just a quick glance at the app is all it takes to see that everything is as it should be at home."

      "label": "With the LEDVANCE SMART+ Bluetooth app, you decide how you want to use all products in our SMART+ Bluetooth family (OSRAM or LEDVANCE branded). Enable our products to control them with Google Home app or Amazon Alexa app. For both options the respective smart speaker is required. You can also use them with Apple Home app and Siri. Furthermore, you can control our SMART+ Bluetooth products with our app, which includes popular features such as turning lights on and off, grouping lights, adjusting the brightness level, changing colors with Full Color products and multi-user access.\n\nPlease note that the LEDVANCE SMART+ app does not work with the OSRAM or LEDVANCE SMART+ Zigbee products or brand new LEDVANCE SMART+ WiFi products.\n\nIn order to control our SMART+ products with the LEDVANCE SMART+ Bluetooth app, you don’t need a separate gateway. The LEDVANCE SMART+ Bluetooth app eliminates the complicated setup problem and provides easy solution. To control you do not even need a WiFi router. \n\nWith our SMART+ Bluetooth products, you will also benefit from the new Bluetooth mesh technology. If you have multiple SMART+ Bluetooth mesh devices, you can control the lights in another room, on the next floor, or even outside your home thanks to the ability of mesh devices to relay commands and information between each other. With Bluetooth mesh devices, you can also take advantage of increased reliability and scalability with a limited delay in response when controlling individual lights or groups of lights together. \n\nMoreover, if you prefer to use our SMART+ Bluetooth products with Google Home, you can simply enable them by the app. Afterwards the products can be easily connected to a Google Home or Nest device. This enables all great features of the Google Home system like app, voice control and routines. \n\nIn addition, you can choose to control our SMART+ Bluetooth products with Apple HomeKit. Follow the steps in the app and connect our products to the Home app. Accordingly our products can be controlled remote by phone or by voice commands with Siri.\n\nAnd finally, if you prefer to control your SMART+ Bluetooth product with Amazon Alexa, enable your device in the app and pair it directly with your Amazon Echo speaker. Only ask Alexa to “Discover my devices” and you will have the unlimited experience of Amazon Alexa system with our products.  Anytime a change of the SMART+ Bluetooth products to another smart home system is possible in the app."

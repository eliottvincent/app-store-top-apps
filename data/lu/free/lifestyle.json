      "label": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

Group your lights into Rooms or Zones — your entire downstairs floor or all the lights in the living room, for example — that mirror the physical rooms in your home. \n\nEasily control your lights — from anywhere \nAdjust your lights’ brightness, temperature, and color and control multiple lights across Rooms or Zones all from the Hue app — and it doesn’t matter where you are. You can use the app to control your lights anywhere you have an internet connection.  \n\nExtraordinary light experiences  \nCreated by professional lighting designers, scenes transform your room in an instant. Create a unique atmosphere with the Honolulu scene, the vibrant colors of Soho, and more. Browse the Hue scene gallery and tap a scene to set it — or create your own based on a photo or your favorite color palette. \n\nLight recipes for your daily routines \nUse the four light recipes designed by lighting experts to support your wellbeing throughout the day. Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound! Use the Sync tab to sync your lights with the Philips Hue Play HDMI sync box or Spotify.\n\nHands-free voice control \nUse Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant to control your smart lights with just your voice. Simple voice commands let you turn lights on and off, dim and brighten, or even change colors without you ever lifting a finger. \n\nUse Siri Shortcuts for quick control\nUse the Shortcuts app to create shortcuts that you can place into widgets on your Home Screen for even faster control of your lights. Turn lights on or off, adjust their brightness and temperature, or set scenes — all without even opening the app. \n\nLearn more about the official Philips Hue app: www.philips-hue.com/app. \n\n*Some features in this app require a Hue Bridge. "

If you don’t dare to say it with words, do it with fruits! \n\nEvery fruit stands for a different kind of relationship: \nCherry: To find your other half #TieTheKnot\nGrape: To share a glass of wine and maybe dine #NoOneNightStand\n\nAnd more... \n\nConsider meeting other people without fear by getting straight to the point, expressing directly what you are really looking for and never waste time again on people that don’t share your point of view. \n\nLaunch the Fruitz app, choose your fruit and discover what others want around you. Swipe the profiles and pick the ones that match what you’re looking for! \n\nSTOP WITH “HEY, WHAT’S UP?”  \nA right swipe, a smoothie (= a match) and the chat opens. It’s the first step before meeting each other so at Fruitz we decided to make it funnier! Say bye to the non-famous “Hey, what’s up?” and for once let’s make the conversation interesting from the start.\n\nChoose a question from a hundred of choices and answer it before starting the conversation with your crush. If some are lovely, others will get you to reveal your secrets… Don’t the best relationships often start with a touch of humor? \n\n*Would you rather never use your smartphone again or never eat meat again? \n*Would you rather travel to Japan or Italy?\n*Would you rather win $1M or have a 50% chance to win $100M? \n\nTASTE THE BEST\nEnjoy the Fruitz Premium experience with features as unlimited likes to swipe right as many profiles as you want, “Pollen” to boost your profile at the top of other people’s basket, daily Crushnotes to increase your chances to match and some new juicy questions to make a good first impression. \n\nTASTE THE EXCELLENCE\nBecome a Golden member to enjoy the excellence of Fruitz: Unlimited likes, Pollen, daily Crushnotes, new juicy questions but also some more new features! With Fruitz Golden, you can now filter by fruit to only see profiles with fruit to your taste, discover who picked you and never miss a smoothie again! \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe Fruitz Premium subscription starts at $10,99/month and 6-month and 12-month packages are available. The Fruitz Golden subscription starts at $26,99/month and 3-month and unlimited packages are available. Prices may vary depending on the country and are subject to change without notice. \n\nIf you choose to purchase Fruitz Premium or Golden, payment will be charged to your iTunes Store account after order has been confirmed. Your subscription will auto-renew and you will be charged within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. Auto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your settings in the Store after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nWe consider the security and privacy of our members very importantly. It is possible for you to prevent your Facebook contacts from seeing your profile.

      "label": "The constantly growing product range of Homematic IP includes devices for climate control, security, weather, light and shutter control applications as well as various accessory components. The climate control devices offer demand-based room-by-room control of radiators throughout the entire house, enabling users to save up to 30 % on their energy costs. And also floor heating systems can efficiently be controlled with Homematic IP products. No movement goes unnoticed with the security components. Users are informed whenever windows and doors are opened. One look at the app is enough to find out that everything is all right at home. Comfort is enhanced with switching and dimming actuators for light control as well as products for automation of shutters and blinds. All Homematic IP devices for brand switches can be easily integrated into the design of existing switch series using our adapters.\n\nFor operation, a Homematic IP Access Point in connection with the Homematic IP app (no recurring costs) is required. Once installed, the system can be controlled comfortably via app, remote control or wall-mounted push-button. In addition, the combination of almost all devices and conditions of various application areas is possible. Therefore, the Homematic IP app offers pre-programmed functionalities as well as the configuration of individual automation rules. There are virtually no limits to the users’ creative leeway. Another benefit is offered by controlling the system using voice control services like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n\nSingle devices are configured by the Homematic IP cloud service, which is run exclusively on servers located in Germany and therefore complies with European and German data protection guidelines. All data stored in the Homematic IP cloud is completely anonymous. However, it does not permit any conclusion about the user’s identity and the individual usage behaviour. Furthermore, all communication between the Access Point, cloud and app is encrypted. As neither during nor after installation of the app you will need to provide private data such as name, email address or mobile phone number, your anonymity is protected 100%.\n \n \nHeating and climate control\n\nHomematic IP offers demand-based control of radiators room-by-room in the entire house, enabling increased living comfort and energy savings of up to 30 %. The Homematic IP Window / Door Contact detects open windows and doors and automatically turns down the heating during ventilation. Afterwards, your heating will be controlled automatically and makes the everyday life easier.\n\nLight and shade\n\nComfortable switching and dimming of lights creates a sense of well-being in your home. Thus, a comfortable atmosphere for your TV evening is created via the app as the ceiling light is dimmed to a desired brightness level while the floor lamp is switched on. Also, the sense of security is increased with an illuminated driveway or house façade in the evening. \nShutters and blinds darken rooms, create a sense of privacy and increase the security. The actuators are controlled comfortably via individual week profiles, also depending on the sunrise and sunset. Furthermore, active shutters and blinds make the home look inhabited even if you are not at home. \n\nSecurity and alarms \n\nIn alarm mode, users are informed whenever windows and doors are opened. Motion detectors offer reliable monitoring in inside and outside areas while sirens and smoke alarms trigger an alarm in case of break-ins or fire. Just a quick glance at the app is all it takes to see that everything is as it should be at home."

Receive an alarm when your baby cries, listen to the automated audio stream or look at live video footage. You can use the app when connected to Wi-Fi or with a 3G or LTE mobile connection. Luna consumes much less battery power and data than other baby monitor apps. Luna is consistently reliable, even when it's running in the background.\n\nRELIABLE, SIMPLE, SECURE\n\nBy using the latest technology, Luna offers maximum reliability and security. You'll never miss an alarm again.\n\nCLEVER DESIGN\n\nWe've invested a lot of time in creating a sophisticated and beautiful design. That is why Luna isn't just user-friendly, it's also nice to look at. Plus, while Luna is monitoring your baby, it displays all the important features.\n\nINTELLIGENT ECO MODE SAVES BATTERY LIFE AND DATA\n\nThanks to our unique Eco-Mode, the Luna app uses 4 times less battery power than any other baby monitoring app while also conserving your data usage.\n\nUNLIMITED COVERAGE\n\nWherever you are,. as long as you have an Internet connection, the Luna app consistently sends you alarms and live audio streams when your child wakes up.\n\nAUDIO AND VIDEO STREAMING\n\nYour Luna parent station automatically receives a live audio stream whenever there's noise in the children's room. Alternatively, you can check the app yourself at any time you like. The video stream will also be activated at any time - without any feedback.\n\nRUNS RELIABLY IN THE BACKGROUND\n\nLuna is a multitasker! As opposed to other baby monitor apps, Luna runs reliably without issues in the background. This frees you up to use your mobile device for other things when you need to.\n\nADJUSTABLE SENSITIVITY \n\nLuna will graphically display the background audio level of the last few minutes. The app will also help you to define the right alarm threshold.\n\nACTIVITY LOG\n\nLuna shows you how long your child has been sleeping and it provides you with a notification record.\n\nENCRYPTED DATA TRANSFER\n\nWe protect your privacy. All data transfers made by Luna are encrypted by SSL. This means that no one else will be able to access your data.\n\nINTELLIGENT CONNECTION MONITORING\n\nYou're on the road and the internet connection went down? Don't worry! Luna continuously monitors the connection between the baby station and the parent station and will notifiy you in case of any interruptions. Luna will also try to automatically restore the connection as quickly as possible.\n\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\n\nYou will need at least two iOS devices (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 2/iPad Mini or newer, iOS 9.3 or newer).\nMake sure that both devices are connected to the internet, and you're good to go!\n\nHONEST APPS, MADE IN GERMANY\n\nA baby monitor which does exactly what it says on the tin: A reliable notification whenever your child cries. \n\nWe're Uberblic Labs, a small development team based in Berlin. You might know our app, ParcelTrack, enjoyed by millions of users worldwide. We develop apps which meet their promises. We hope you like our new baby monitor. Should you have any questions or comments, please send an email to: team@happyparentssoftware.com. We look forward to hearing from you!"

Get yours at https://tractive.com\n\n\n\nMain features:\n\n\n\n* Track your dog or cat in real-time with unlimited range\n\n\n\n* Monitor activity & sleep, keep your pet fit, and compete with other furry friends\n\n\n\n* See your pet's location history \n\n\n\n* Set safe areas - like your garden - with virtual fences, and get a notification if your pet leaves one\n\n\n\n* Share location - let friends and family track your pet, and share real-time location with others\n\n\n\n\nTractive GPS trackers work in over 175 countries. Get yours along with the free app to start enjoying these features.\n\n\n\n\n*** Activity & Sleep Tracking ***\n\n\n\nSee how active your dog or cat is. Set goals. Compare with other pets. Spot sleep patterns, and make sure your furry friend is getting quality rest. \n\n\n\n*** LIVE Tracking ***\n\n\n\nNeed extra reassurance? Go into LIVE mode to follow your pet's every move, and get location updates every 2-3 seconds.\n\n\n\n*** Virtual Fence (Safe Zones & No-Go Zones) ***\n\n\n\nSet safe zones - like your garden - as well as no-go zones your buddy should avoid - like a field near a busy road. You'll get a quick alert when they leave or enter one of them. You can set up several virtual fences, make them big or small, and move them easily across the map.\n\n\n\n*** Find Mode ***\n\n\n\nPinpoint your dog’s location in close range. The closer you get, the more circles fill up on your screen. Perfect for indoor tracking and when GPS signal is weak.\n\n\n\n*** Location History & Heatmap ***\n\n\n\nFind out your pet's favorite spots, where they've been recently, and what they've been up to.\n\n\n\n*** Location Sharing ***\n\n\n\nLet friends, family and others you trust (like walkers or pet-sitters) track location and activity. You can also share real-time location with anyone with a single tap - very useful if your pet runs off and you need help bringing them back home.\n\n\n\n*** Interactive Map ***\n\n\n\nView the location of all your pets with trackers at the same time, or zoom in on a single pet. Add all your pets with GPS trackers in the Tractive app. Switch between regular map view or satellite view. Tilt the map in 3D view by using two fingers. \n\n\n\n*** Up to 7 days battery life ***\n\n\n\nDepends on usage, coverage and how active your dog or cat is. Set up a Power Saving Zone at home to maximize battery life.\n\n\n\n\n*The Tractive GPS app works with all Tractive GPS trackers.*"

Sobriety is a 24-hour struggle, so start your day off by making a pledge to stay sober. Then you can review how your day went and log notes at the end of the day.\n\n• Sobriety calculator\nView how much money & time you’ve saved by being sober.\n\n• Analyze triggers\nRecap each day and find patterns that made your day easier or more challenging than the last.\n\n• Share your story\nEither with others or for yourself, take photos and journal your progress directly in the app. Then choose to share it or save it as a reminder for yourself.\n\n• Milestone tracker\nTrack and celebrate your milestones from 1 day, to 1 week, to 1 month and beyond. Compare experiences with others on their sober journey. Read how they felt at this milestone and what you can expect. If you’re struggling, share your story and invite others to offer help or advice.\n\n• Withdrawal timeline\nWhen you create an account and declare your addiction, you can instantly see a withdrawal timeline to get an idea of what to expect for your next few days (and weeks). What’s more, you can contribute to it. See how many others saw an increase in their restfulness vs those that saw an increase in anxiety. Prepare yourself for what’s to come in recovery.\n\n• Customize your experience\nYou set the time, your sober birthday, the category of motivation you need, the addictions you’re trying to break, even the end-of-day summaries. Make the app customized to your lifestyle and tailored to your needs.\n\n**Sober Plus subscriptions**\n\nI Am Sober is free to use, but you can support development of the app with a subscription to Sober Plus. With Sober Plus, you'll get access to these premium features:\n\n• Create a group\nStay accountable together and track your sobriety privately. Groups are great for complimenting your real-world group like Alcoholics Anonymous, NA, SA, SMART Recovery, or your rehab center.\n\n• Locked access\nKeep your trackers private with a lock that you can access via TouchID or FaceID.\n\n• Data Backups\nSave your progress in the cloud and restore your trackers if you get a new device.\n\n• More tracking\nTrack more addictions and get access to more communities. Even if your addiction is specific like Wine, Online Shopping, or Skin Picking, you’ll find a variety of communities of people who are all trying to get sober from alcohol, drugs, eating disorders, self-harm, and more.\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. I Am Sober Plus automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\n\nTerms of service: https://iamsober.com/terms-of-service/\nPrivacy policy: https://iamsober.com/privacy-policy/"

Keep the social distance and also stay connected with your friends and family.\n\n\nTake a look at our app features:\n\t\n- Local-Secret-Santa:\n      The lottery drawing takes place while everyone involved is present. Those who are not present get their results by e-mail.\n\t\n- Online-Secret-Santa:\n      all Secret-Santa's get their results by mail.\n\n\n- Intelligent random generator\n      The intelligent random number generator prevents you from drawing yourself and enables the determination of Anti-Secret-Santa's.\n\t\n- Anti-Secret-Santa's:\n       You can make sure not to be matched with a certain person by assigning a Secret-Santa an Anti-Secret-Santa (handy for couples or also last year’s Secret-Santa)\n\t\n- The app can be used completely without registration.\n\n- In the app several different groups can be created.\n\t\n- Optionally the results can be sent by mail or shared by various messengers or SMS.\n\n- You can add your wishes to give your Secret-Santa a hint.\n\n- Furthermore, to each group additional information (like the event date or the budget) can be added.\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n\nProject by JHSV with Vincent Haupt and Juri Seelmann."

Under certain circumstances, opening the vehicle door remotely may not be possible as long as the FOB key is inside]\n\nThe Kia Connect app has been developed to work in combination with a Kia car equipped with Kia Connect.

Your defined heating profiles are securely and easily transmitted via BLUETOOTH® Smart to the radiator thermostats. In this way, you will always find your ideal room temperature - without wasting energy while nobody is at home. The BLUETOOTH® Smart Radiator Thermostats can be quickly and easily installed, without having to drain any water or intervene in the heating system. Simply replace your conventional radiator thermostats by BLUETOOTH® Smart Radiator Thermostats and start saving energy!\n\nWith the calor BT app, up to five BLUETOOTH® Smart Radiator Thermostats can be configured and controlled right from the beginning.\n\nEasy configuration \nIn the app, the BLUETOOTH® Smart Radiator Thermostats are easily taught-in and allocated to rooms. The user-friendly display of set-up rooms enables intuitive control via the app.\n\nIndividual comfort temperature for each room \nYou can comfortably control the room temperature via the app e.g. from your couch and adjust your heating control system to your personal needs. \n\nIndividual time control\nWith freely programmable heating profiles you can define individually tailored temperatures for each room at any time and create heating profiles with up to three heating phases per day. In this way, your home will only be heated when it needs to be. No more heating energy will be wasted while you are not at home and your energy savings will increase considerably.\n\nAutomatic mode\nThe automatic mode can be activated via the calor BT app. The BLUETOOTH® Smart Radiator Thermostats regulate the room temperature according to your defined and selected heating profiles.\n\nManual mode\nAlso the manual mode can be set via the app. The automatic mode is stopped and the radiator thermostats will remain at a defined temperature.\n\nHoliday mode \nTo ensure that no heating energy will be wasted while you are out of the house (e.g. for holidays) you can activate the holiday function via the app before your journey. The temperature is then reduced via the BLUETOOTH® Smart Radiator Thermostats until a previously defined time. Afterwards, the rooms will be set back right in time to your personal comfort temperature so that a warm and cosy home will be waiting for you after your journey.\n\nBoost function\nWith the boost function, cool rooms can be heated within short. The function can be activated either via the app or directly at the device. The heating valve opens completely for five minutes. There will be a pleasant room temperature right away because of the radiated heat. By the end of the boost phase, the BLUETOOTH® Smart Radiator Thermostats automatically change back to the prior operating mode.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bluetooth® word mark and logos are registered trademarks owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc. and any use of such marks by eQ-3 AG is under license.

Through uplifting statements and quotes, you'll believe in yourself with these one-a-day affirmations for daily motivation.\n\nHold down the large gray button to reveal your daily affirmation and effectively use the app by repeating the statement out loud.  Saying the affirmation in front of a mirror is even better. It's been scientifically proven that the more stimuli your mind has, the more your mind will retain the information.  By vocalizing in front of a mirror, you stimulate sight and sound.  Envision your personal success.\n\nLet these positive declarations become truth in your subconscious mind as you think about it throughout the day.\n\nGive us some feedback in the app if you have suggestions or problems.  We really doubt you'll need this though;  just look at all the raving reviews:\n\n\"Missing one important thing - I think this app is neat but I believe the real power of daily affirmations is when you repeat the same affirmations day after day. A new one every day kind of loses its power because you should be repeating the ones that are important to you so that they eventually become ingrained and change your way of thinking. So, a favorites list would be the perfect solution! If a daily affirmation pops up that you really want to stay with you, add to your favorites and go to your favorites list and read through them everyday. ...\" - Tag477543\n\nExcellent affirmations\nThis app provides excellent affirmations to start your day. Every day a new affirmation is generated in which you can use and apply it to your life. I have been using it for a couple of months and it definitely helps start my day to a positive start. I highly recommend it!!\n-Oceanblue27\n\nFantastic\nI love this affirmations app, it's really practical, it's not just a bunch of quotes like some affirmations apps I've seen. :) well done!\n-Ladyredfearn\n\nHighly recommend this app. - I love this app. The affirmation statements are great and not convoluted. I love the hold button and the slow revealing of the affirmation. Gives you that moment to slow your mind and focus on the moment and truly take in the affirmation.\n- Hkygal\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPress and hold the large gray button to reveal today's affirmation.\n\nTap the bottom left icon for options on sharing, saving or skipping the affirmation.  You can SHARE, SAVE, or VIEW the affirmation.\n\nWhen viewing your list of Favorite affirmations you can swipe left to delete an affirmation.  Tapping on a specific affirmation will let you view it.\n\nTo add your own affirmations, tap on the bottom left icon then tap on \"Add Your Own\".  Any affirmation you add will appear in your favorites list.\n\nTo record yourself saying an affirmation, tap the top right REC icon and then on the red button to start recording.  You can save one recording per affirmation.\n\nTo add your own backgrounds, tap on the bottom right icon,  then tap on \"My Backgrounds\".  Any background here will appear in one of your daily affirmations unless you set one as your current.\n\nALL ACCESS\nWhen you subscribe to \"All Access\":\n - Ads are removed (even if you decide to cancel)\n - Set up email notifications of your favorites\n - No limits* on Phone Alerts\n - No limits on the number of recordings\n - No limits on the number of backgrounds\n - Set the daily affirmation as a Phone Alert\n - Set a background and font for each favorite\n\n* Notifications are limited to device limits.\n\n“All Access” is a monthly subscription that automatically renews at the same cost as the first month.

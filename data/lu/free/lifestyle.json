Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms\n\nBumble Inc. is the parent company of Bumble, along with Badoo and Fruitz"

You have an overview of all information and control your vehicle via the app.\n\nMERCEDES ME: ALL FUNCTIONS AT A GLANCE\n\nALWAYS INFORMED: The Vehicle Status informs you about the mileage, range, current fuel level or data from your last journey, for example. Use the app to conveniently check your tyre pressure, the status of the doors, windows, sliding sunroof/soft-top and boot, or the current locking status. You can also pinpoint the location of your vehicle and receive warning messages regarding unlocked doors, for example.\n\nCONVENIENT VEHICLE CONTROL: With the Mercedes me App, you can remotely lock and unlock or open and close the doors, windows, and sliding sunroof. Start the auxiliary heating/ventilation or program this for your departure time. In electric vehicles, you can also activate pre-entry climate control and temper the vehicle immediately or for a defined departure time.\n\nCONVENIENT ROUTE PLANNING: Plan your route at your leisure and conveniently send addresses to your Mercedes via the app. This means you can get in and drive off straight away.\n\nSAFETY IN AN EMERGENCY: The Mercedes me App notifies you of attempted theft, an attempt to tow away the vehicle and parking damage. If a vehicle alarm has been tripped, you can turn it off via the app. The Geofencing service sends you a notification as soon as the vehicle enters or leaves an area defined by you. In addition, you can configure Speedfencing and Valet Protect in the app, and receive push notifications in the event of their violations.\n\nFUEL-SAVING DRIVING: The Mercedes me App shows you your vehicle's individual fuel consumption. It also compares your fuel consumption with that of other drivers of the same vehicle model. The ECO display informs you about the sustainability of your driving style.\n\nSIMPLY ELECTRIC: The Mercedes me App lets you display your vehicle's range on a map and search for charging stations near you. The app also allows you to start the charging process at a public charging station.\n\nDiscover the full convenience of the new Mercedes me Apps: They offer you ideal support for making your mobile everyday life easier and more flexible.\n\nLet the app help you. The Mercedes me Service App gives you a timely reminder of your next service appointment, which is easy to book from your smartphone. Also in the app: practical How-To videos in which you can find out more about your Mercedes-Benz and perform simple maintenance tasks yourself if you choose.\n\nExpand your mobile options with the Mercedes me Store App. Easily find and buy innovative digital products available for your Mercedes. Keep track of the remaining terms of your Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features, and renew these as desired directly from your smartphone.\n\nPlease note: Mercedes me connect services and on-demand features only work with Mercedes-Benz vehicles that are equipped with the Mercedes me connect Communication Module. The range of functions depends on the particular vehicle equipment and your booked services. Your authorised Mercedes-Benz dealer will be happy to advise you. Use requires an active, free-of-charge Mercedes me account. The functions can be restricted temporarily if there is insufficient data transmission bandwidth. Continuous use of the GPS function in the background may shorten your battery life."

Start the day with the cool daylight of Energize to give you a morning boost, followed by the brighter Concentrate setting to help you get things done. The Read light recipe gives you the perfect shade of light in which to read your favorite book, while the dimmed golden glow of Relax helps you wind down.  \n\nPersonalize with automations \nMake your smart lights work around your daily routine. Whether you want your lights to gently wake you up in the morning or greet you when you get home, setting up customizable automations in the Hue app is effortless — and fun!  \n\nSync your smart lights \nMake your lights flash, dance, dim, brighten, and change color in sync with your screen or sound!

      "label": "Over 40 million families around the world have chosen AlfredCamera to secure their home. We are the world's most popular and top-rated app for home security.\n\n\nSECURITY CAMERA FOR THE SMARTPHONE AGE \n\nPeople love Alfred Camera! The all-in-one app provides more features than a basic, expensive security camera. You can get live stream, instant intruder alert, walkie-talkie, and unlimited cloud storage to store, share, and playback your video footage.\n\n\nFREE, STABLE, RELIABLE\n\nIf you want a CCTV to keep an eye on your belongings, a baby monitor to look after your newborn, or a pet cam to entertain your lovely pets, Alfred Camera is the best choice!\n\n\nSUPER EASY TO SET UP\n\nDIY your own home security camera in 3 minutes. No cost, no hard skills; just one creative idea! Alfred Camera is the easiest-to-install home surveillance system with professional-grade features, period.\n\n\nANYTIME, ANYWHERE\n\nUnlike traditional CCTV cameras or home surveillance cameras, you can put Alfred wherever you need to strengthen security. It works like a portable video monitor, so you don’t even need a security guard! After all, if anything like theft or breaking in happens, the video footage will be extremely helpful.\n\n\nSIMPLE SECURITY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\n\nWith crystal clear live stream, you'll always know exactly what's going on. Additionally, Alfred's motion sensor will send you an instant alert when it finds an intruder. You can scare the intruder away by the walkie-talkie immediately. The auto-recorded videos will be kept in free, unlimited cloud storage. You can use them as evidence to help identify the suspect. \n\n\nFEATURES\n\nAlfred Camera has all of the standard features of a home security camera, along with the following:\n\n• 24/7 LIVE STREAM: Watch the high-quality live video from anywhere.\n• SMART INTRUDER ALERT: Get instant alert when the camera picks up any movement.\n• UNLIMITED CLOUD STORAGE: Playback, download, and share your video footage at any time. \n• LOW-LIGHT FILTER: Reinforce security when it's dark.\n• WALKIE-TALKIE: Deter thieves, interact with visitors or pets, and soothe babies.\n• 360 CAMERA: Cover a larger area with both lenses.\n• ZOOM, SCHEDULE, REMINDER, TRUST CIRCLE, SIREN and more...\n\nA housekeeper you can really trust! Works smoothly via WiFi, 3G, and LTE.\n\n\nSMART, CONVENIENT, ECO-CONSCIOUS\n\nFirst time choosing a CCTV camera? Still hoping to find good reviews on expensive baby monitor, pet cam, or IP camera? You can protect your home with a smarter solution. Here's a tip: You might not even need to buy a real CCTV camera, baby monitor, IP cam or IP webcam. \n\nBesides the cost of the equipment, these smart home appliances often charge a monthly fee. With security apps like Alfred, there is no complicated installation, IP settings, or contract. You only have to download Alfred to repurpose your old devices as a DIY WiFi Camera or baby monitor: pure and simple. \n\nThe best home surveillance camera you can ever find: Free, reliable, versatile and easy to use. No hidden upfront costs or astronomical monitoring fees. Alfred is also an essential component of any home improvement or home automation project if you are interested in building a smart home or experimenting with Google Assistant. \n\nEveryone is taking advantage of their unused smartphones by turning them into video players, GPS navigators, or fitness devices. So why not use yours as a baby cam, nanny cam, pet cam, webcam or IP cam?\n\n\nAlfred Premium, a subscription service, charges 3.99 USD/month. It offers HD viewing, recording, as well as ad removal. At the confirmation of upgrade, the payment will be charged to your iTunes Account. The account will be automatically charged for renewal unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the current subscription expires. You can manage your subscription and auto-renewal by going to Account Settings.\n\nTerms of Service:\nhttps://alfred.camera/legal/terms-of-service"

If you don’t dare to say it with words, do it with fruits! \n\nEvery fruit stands for a different kind of relationship: \nCherry: To find your other half #TieTheKnot\nGrape: To share a glass of wine and maybe dine #NoOneNightStand\n\nAnd more... \n\nConsider meeting other people without fear by getting straight to the point, expressing directly what you are really looking for and never waste time again on people that don’t share your point of view. \n\nLaunch the Fruitz app, choose your fruit and discover what others want around you. Swipe the profiles and pick the ones that match what you’re looking for! \n\nSTOP WITH “HEY, WHAT’S UP?”  \nA right swipe, a smoothie (= a match) and the chat opens. It’s the first step before meeting each other so at Fruitz we decided to make it funnier! Say bye to the non-famous “Hey, what’s up?” and for once let’s make the conversation interesting from the start.\n\nChoose a question from a hundred of choices and answer it before starting the conversation with your crush. If some are lovely, others will get you to reveal your secrets… Don’t the best relationships often start with a touch of humor? \n\n*Would you rather never use your smartphone again or never eat meat again? \n*Would you rather travel to Japan or Italy?\n*Would you rather win $1M or have a 50% chance to win $100M? \n\nTASTE THE BEST\nEnjoy the Fruitz Premium experience with features as unlimited likes to swipe right as many profiles as you want, “Pollen” to boost your profile at the top of other people’s basket, daily Crushnotes to increase your chances to match and some new juicy questions to make a good first impression. \n\nTASTE THE EXCELLENCE\nBecome a Golden member to enjoy the excellence of Fruitz: Unlimited likes, Pollen, daily Crushnotes, new juicy questions but also some more new features!

Unser Unterbewusstsein steckt jedoch voller unwahrer und die Wirklichkeit verzerrender Gedanken. Was du über dich denkst, so behandeln dich die Anderen. Was du über das Leben denkst, so offenbart es sich vor dir. Was du über deine Mitmenschen denkst, bestätigen sie dir wie ein Spiegel.\n\nIn dieser App erhältst du täglich einen Gedanken, den du wie eine geistige „Lokomotive“ an den Anfang deines Tages stellen kannst. Er kann Dich anstoßen, aufrütteln und inspirieren auf dem Weg vom „Normalmenschen“ zum glücklichen Menschen. \n\nDie App bietet dir folgende Funktionen im Überblick:\n\n• Lass dich täglich von einem Gedanken für den Tag von Robert Betz inspirieren\n• Wähle im Kalender einen Gedanken eines vergangenen Tages gezielt aus und navigiere\ndurch die verschiedenen Monate\n• Lege eine Zeit fest, zu der der tägliche Gedanke mit einer Erinnerung angezeigt wird\n• Markiere einzelne Favoriten und lass sie dir in einer Übersicht anzeigen\n• Lass dich mit der Zufallsfunktion von einem zufälligen Gedanken überraschen\n• Teile einzelne Gedanken mit Freunden\n• Wechsel zwischen verschiedenen Hintergrundmotiven (inkl. neue Motive)\n• Erfahre mehr über Robert Betz und seine Arbeit\n\nDie Zitate dieser App helfen dir, dich aus Unbewusstheit zur Bewusstheit, aus Unklarheit und Verwirrung zur Klarheit, aus Unfrieden zum Frieden, aus Unfreiheit zur Freiheit und aus der Angst in die Liebe zu führen. Gedanken sind unendlich machtvoll. Nimm sie mit Liebe auf und wenn dein Herz dir sagt: „Ja, das stimmt!“, dann lebe die Gedanken. Damit veränderst du deine Lebens-Qualität in erstaunlich kurzer Zeit. Lebe den Wandel, sei selbst der Wandel.\n\nApple-Nutzungsbedingungen: www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

      "label": "Ajax will protect your family and business from burglars, fire, and flooding. If something bad happens, the system will instantly activate the sirens, notify of danger and call the security company patrol dispatch.\n\nIN THE APP:\n\n◦ Manage security modes and your smart home from anywhere in the world\n◦ Get alarm notifications\n◦ Monitor system events\n◦ View the photos taken with the detectors of the MotionCam lineup, and security camera footage\n◦ Set up devices, automation scenarios, and security schedules\n\n• • • \n\n“Intruder Alarm of the Year” — Security & Fire Excellence Awards, London\n“Security & Firefighting Risks” — silver medal at Expoprotection Awards, Paris\n“Intruder product of the year” — PSI Premier Awards 2020\n“Security System of the Year” — Ukrainian People Choice Award 2021\n\n1.5 million people in 130 countries are protected by Ajax.\n\n• • •\n\nAGAINST BURGLARS\nThe detectors instantly capture an intruder on your property, doors or windows opening, and glass breaking. As soon as a person enters a protected area, they will be captured by the photo camera of the MotionCam detector lineup. You and the security company will know what happened.\n\nONE CLICK AND HELP IS ON THE WAY\nPress the panic button on the app, key fob, or keyboard in an emergency. Ajax will call a security company patrol dispatch or medical help and notify all system users about the danger.\n\nDETECTING FIRE AND CARBON MONOXIDE\nFire detectors notify of smoke and temperature spike and promptly alert about a dangerous carbon monoxide (CO) concentration with no color, smell, or taste. The built-in sirens will wake up even those who are fast asleep.\n\nINFORMING ABOUT FLOODING\nThe detectors notify of a pipe break, a washing machine leak, or an overflowing bathtub. The system will inform users, while scenarios with relays automatically turn off the water. And if the upstairs neighbors flood your apartment, you will get the app notification. \n\nVIDEO CAMERA IN THE SMARTPHONE \nWatch video from security cameras directly in the app. Connecting the Dahua, Uniview, Hikvision, and Safire cameras and DVRs takes a minute. Equipment from other manufacturers is connected via an RTSP link.\n\nSMART HOME\nChange security modes up to a schedule, program the outdoor lighting to turn on when strangers are detected on your property, or implement an anti-flood system. Manage gates, electric locks, lighting, heating, and electrical appliances. In the app, automatically by scenario or by pressing a smart button.\n\nPROFESSIONAL LEVEL OF RELIABILITY\nThe hub runs on OS Malevich, protected from failures, viruses, and cyberattacks. Thanks to the backup battery and communication channels, the system is resistant to power outages or the lack of Internet connectivity. The account is protected by session control and two-factor authentication. Ajax has been rated Grade 2 by five independent labs.\n\nCONNECTING TO THE SECURITY COMPANY MONITORING STATION\n3,500 security companies in 130 countries work with the Ajax security systems.\n\n• • •\n\nAjax equipment is required to work with the app. You can buy the devices from authorized Ajax partners in your region.\n\nLearn more: www.ajax.systems\n\nHave any questions?

Setting up the system using the app is simple and intuitive! It's a breeze to control your luminaires — no wires needed. And that goes for your luminaires from Occhio as well as those from many other manufacturers.\n\nGroups\nYou can assign luminaires to groups and control them all at once — switching on and off, dimming and fading the entire group. These can be all wal luminaires for example or all luminaires in one room. \n\nScenes\nYou can define an ideal lighting mood for certain situations once and then retrieve the exact setting again and again — so you'll have your personal favorite light, for instance, when working, watching TV or having dinner. And every luminaire can even be included in multiple scenes – in the brightness you have specified for that scene. \n\nGallery\nThe gallery lets you experience lighting control in a very special, intuitive way: Simply take a picture of your room and select the luminaires in the image that you want to control. You'll be able to control your light right from that image! \n\nOcchio controller\nOcchio offers the Occhio controller as an additional control option, along with the app, which can be programmed by the app to control four different luminaires, groups or scenes - switching them on/off, dimming or up/down fading – with no need for an iPhone or iPad at all.\n\nReceivers\nEither the Occhio Sento luminaires with »air« heads or »air« modules can be used as receivers. Once the luminaires have an electrical connection, they will appear in the app as »Nearby devices« and can be controlled via app immediately. \n\nOcchio Sento luminaires can be switched on and off, dimmed and faded. »touchless fading« is a unique Occhio feature — it allows the full light output to be drawn from one side to the other. You can thereby change the mood of the room with a simple gesture on your iPhone or iPad. \n\nOcchio air modules can be connected to any trailing-edge phase cut dimmable luminaire. They can then be switched on/off and dimmed with the app."

      "label": "Like you, LIFX wants smarter light. This means we care about the way you control your smart lights, as much as we do about the lights themselves. We make it easy to get started with WiFi-enabled, bright, colorful smart lights that need no hub. Yep, you can start with just one device.\n\nLIFX App 4 can not only help give you the best start, but will turn your experience “up to 11”. Automate your wake up Schedule, or set up your movie-watching Scene (then set up voice control so you don’t even have to leave the sofa), or play with Effects next time you’re entertaining. \n\nFeatures.\nThe LIFX app is packed full of features like:\n\n- The Basics: on/off, dim, change color, change white temperature.\n- Groups: control all lights in a group easily, including on/off and dimming with one touch from the Home Dashboard.\n- Group personalization: choose a LIFX illustration to suit or personalize Group cards with your own pictures. \n- Schedules: automate your lights to fade, change color, and turn on/off, all visible in an easy calendar-style view.\n- Effects: play with special effects like the music visualizer, fire, move, candle flicker, strobe, color cycle & more, all in one place.\n- Scenes: set your lighting just the way you like it and save it for later.\n- Themes: a library of one click color combinations for a Group, from ‘Proud’ to ‘Soothing’.\n- Paint: with your finger in the app, paint color live onto your LIFX Z, Beam, Tile and Candle.\n- Custom color palettes: add your favorite colors to a custom color palette.\n- Discover Tab: find How To guides, learn about integration partners, or shop for LIFX\n- and much more.\n\nExample uses from our customers:\n\n- Ambiance: schedule warmer light in the evening - to calm - and whiter light in the morning - to energize.\n- “Moccupancy”: set irregular schedules to make it seem like you’re home when you’re not.\n- Sleep: set your bedroom lights to deep red just before bed to produce more melatonin which helps you get better quality sleep.\n- Stay put: you’ve settled into the sofa for a streaming binge but left the lights on. No need to jump up to the switch, just ask your voice assistant.\n- Pet owners: if you're unexpectedly late home from work, turn the lights on for your dog from wherever you are.\n- Silent notifications: use partner apps to give you a light flash if… your car is arriving, or the forecast says it will rain, or you are mentioned on social media, and much more.\n\nHomeKit\nBest color-changing smart bulb for HomeKit cnet \nPairing LIFX with Apple HomeKit is easy using the HomeKit onboarding QR code available in the product packaging.\n\nStay in touch.\nNeed a helping hand, or want to offer us some advice? We would love to hear from you about your LIFX experience. You can reach us at support@lifx.com.\nLIFX lights are available at lifx.com"

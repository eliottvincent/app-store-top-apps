If all of your family members install the iMapp application, you will be able to know not only their current geolocation, but also the places in which they have visited during the past 60 days.\n\nInstall iMapp and you will be able to:\n\n• track the location of your friends and relatives connected to the service \n• find out the location of any person; regardless of whether they have the app on their device installed (targeted devices should support HTML5)\n• view the time list of location(s) of your friends for last 60 days\n• get notifications when your friends arrive or leave from the places that you have created\n• control the battery level of your friends and family's phones\n• get directions to your friends, events, or any other places that you wish\n• create your own places on the map\n• share your location with your favorite friends in automatic mode\n• use the program for tracking locations of children and relatives\n• send the coordinates of a selected location using the most convenient way\n• use the most energy-saving technology of location tracking.\n\nThe accuracy of coordinates whilst searching for devices using phone number or email depends on the availability of built-in GPS/GSM/WiFi modules on the targeted devices. In the case that there is no GPS, the coordinates are detected according to the data of cellular networks, with the accuracy ranging from 100 to 1000m. If there is no GPS and GSM, then the coordinates are detected via IP address. This function works by sending a unique message - that the app generates - to the phone number supplied which contains the location. The message will be opened every time when you want to update the person's location.\n\nIf you are involved in confidential matters, you may change your status in iMapp so that your mark is displayed only to your favorite friends; or you can make yourself invisible.\n\niMapp has the following subscriptions:\n\niMapp Premium - $4.99/mo, $39.99/yr\niMapp PRO - $9.99/mo, $59.99/yr\nWith Premium, you will be able to connect any number of devices to the iMapp service. This allows you to track connected devices via PC, locate persons using a cell phone and also access 24/7 support. With the PRO version, you get all the features of Premium as well as unlimited moving logs of all your friends and relatives. Premium and PRO yearly subscriptions come with a free 3 day trial. When the trial expires, the subscription will auto-renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You will receive your first charge 3 days after starting your trial. The subscription costs will be charged from your score, linked through an iTunes account. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at regular intervals, according to what you selected, if you do not cancel it earlier than 24 hours before the end of the current period. You will not be able to unsubscribe after you have purchase it. Subscription changes are available in the Settings of your iTunes account after purchase.\n\nSolicited access:\n- to the camera and photo - to install the avatar\n- to contacts - to invite friends\n- to geo-position, including the background mode - to find the devices location\n- to push notifications - to send chat notifications\n\nGet acquainted to the Terms of Use you can on the link below: \nhttp://imap-app.com/Terms.html\nhttp://imap-app.com/privacypolicy.html\n\nNOTE: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of the phone"

When you go over a preset speed limit, the large digits change colour from green to red and the device emits a loud sound to alert you! Great for avoiding speeding tickets!\n\n‣ Easy to set and configurable speed limits \nSet speed limits with 4 fast and configurable presets. Presets only need a single tap and are the safest way to set the limits! \n\n‣ S.O.S. Flat tyre or worse? \nOur speedometer shows your current location and you can share it easily (sms/text, email) with car assistance services, ambulance or friends. \n\n‣ Know your car's limits ! \nDoes your car become sluggish on those steep climbs? Is it possible you got too high in mountains ? Our built-in altimeter will provide you with accurate readings that indicate your height over sea-level. \n\n‣ In a dispute for speeding?\nGPS Black box gives you point by point time, speed, location and altitude data for the last 20 minutes of your travel. You can email its data as an excel or csv file. Or you can surely switch it off or reset at any moment.\n\n‣ Need to know where you are?\nIntegrated map shows your location and a tracking \"tail\" behind you.\n\n∙∙ UNIVERSAL APP. Speedometer for iPhone and 3G-iPads. Retina graphics included. \n\n∙∙ 000-999 SPEED AND LIMIT RANGE. MPH, KMH AND KNOTS. Maximum, average speed, distance traveled. \n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone 3GS, 4, or 4S as well as on any iPad with 3G. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS chip (External GPS module is required).\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nDrive safely and avoid paying those speeding fines! Our speedometer is the ideal watchdog companion no matter what journey you are going on!\n\nFull version of the speedometer gives you ability to work in background, GPS tracking, waypoints, trip cost computer, Siri shortcuts for applying speed limits and controlling track recording, 100+ customization options and more. Be sure to check it out in the AppStore!\n\n* A bit of instructions: If speedometer doesn't show you the speed, just be sure to be under the open sky to have GPS signal. Under the open sky, within 5-10 seconds GPS indicator will become green and speedometer will start showing the speed.\n** If you wonder why gps speedometer may show 3-5 mph (3-8 kmh) less than a car's speedometer, you can take a look here: http://goo.gl/wtLvT (tomtom's discussion thread).\n*** And here is an amazing article http://goo.gl/p5zfMi explaining why GPS might show you 80ft (or -80!) altitude when you are laying on the beach. Don't throw the app or iPhone away just because of that! :) Let us use the article's last sentence here: \"Those who use GPS altitude to aid in landing their small plane should have their insurance policies paid up at all times\"."

      "label": "To be used in conjunction with Land Rover vehicles which are fitted with the next-generation infotainment system, InControl Touch Pro, the Land Rover Route Planner App allows you to navigate from door to door. Before setting out from your home, set your destination from your smartphone and you’ll be directed to your Land Rover as the app detects your vehicle's location. The smartphone app will then automatically sync with your Land Rover's navigation system using the Cloud so your car will be ready to take over navigating soon after you get in. Once you've finished your in-car journey, navigation is then handed back to your smartphone, which provides any final public transport and pedestrian directions to your final destination.\n\nIn addition the Route Planner app also allows you to pre-plan trips and holidays by searching for places of interest or restaurants and saving them as favourites from your smartphone. You will then be able to access these saved locations from the in-car navigation system at a later date. \n\nNote:\n• Requires InControl Navigation Account to sign-in. Account can be registered from either your Land Rover’s navigation settings or landrover.here.com.\n• As we systematically introduce InControl, specific features, options and its availability remain market dependent. This app requires that your vehicle be fitted with its relevant connectivity package as well as a Micro SIM card with a suitable data contract. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

Get out. Get parked.\n\nTHE PARK ASSIST SYSTEM AT A GLANCE:\n· Safe parking and manoeuvring – as if by magic\n· Automatic scanning for roadside parking spaces\n· Parking manoeuvre selection based on specific parking space\n· Remote-controlled parking via app outside the vehicle\n\nHERE’S HOW IT WORKS:\nThe Park Assist Plus app installed on your smartphone connects to your Touareg via Bluetooth.\nAs you arrive at your destination, start your park assist system in the vehicle and choose how you’d like to park (e.g. parallel).\nThe assist system checks the side of the road for available parking spaces of the right size and shows you on the display once it’s found what it’s looking for. When you switch the engine off, you can send the parking process to the app via the infotainment system and get out of the car, looking out for oncoming traffic.\nYou can now start the parking process in your Remote Parking Assistant app. The assist system takes control of your vehicle and parks in your chosen space by itself.\nFor safety reasons, you need to hold down the app’s Drive button at all times and stay close to the vehicle. When the process is complete, your Touareg is safely parked and locks automatically.\nWhen you’d like to drive away in your Touareg, launch the app within range of your vehicle and select a parking manoeuvre. Your Touareg’s Park Assist Plus will manoeuvre your vehicle back out of the parking space, taking oncoming traffic into account.\nWhen the selected manoeuvre is complete, you can get in your car and take the wheel.\n\nPlease note that the Volkswagen Park Assist Plus app is currently only available for use in the Touareg and with the relevant special equipment (‘Park Assist Plus – ready for remote-controlled parking’).\n\nTerms of use: https://consent.vwgroup.io/consent/v1/texts/RPA/de/en/termsofUse/latest/pdf\r\n\nData privacy notes: https://consent.vwgroup.io/consent/v1/texts/RPA/de/en/DataPrivacy/latest/pdf"

      "label": "Sicher und schnell erfahren, wo und wie Drohnenpiloten Ihre Drohne fliegen dürfen. Diese Fragen beantwortet ab sofort die Drohnen-App der DRONIQ GmbH. Ziel der DRONIQ, einem Joint Venture der Deutschen Flugsicherung (DFS) und der Deutschen Telekom ist die sichere und faire Integration von Drohnen in den Luftraum. \n\nPlanung, Prüfung und Durchführung von Missionen\n\nDie kostenfreie App ist konform mit der neuen EU-Verordnung und berücksichtigt die damit einhergehenden Vorschriften und Anforderungen für den Drohnenflug. Sie richtet sich insbesondere an Hobby- und Freizeitpiloten und unterstützt sie entlang der gesamten Missionsplanung und der anschließenden Durchführung. Nach der Missionsspezifizierung durch den Piloten prüft die App die Mission in Echtzeit mit Blick auf die geltenden Luftraumverordnungen und -beschränkungen. Der Nutzer wird innerhalb weniger Minuten informiert, ob seine geplante Mission erlaubt ist. Die Frage „Wo darf ich fliegen“ wird durch die App somit schnell beantwortet. Bekommt der Nutzer ein negatives Ergebnis, kann er über die App im Detail prüfen, welche Vorgaben bei der aktuellen Missionsplanung noch nicht eingehalten werden und diese entsprechend anpassen. \n\n \n\nNeben luftraumrelevanten Daten zeigt interaktives Kartenmaterial die typische Infrastruktur, wie Krankenhäuser, Polizeistationen usw. an und warnt den Nutzer, wenn seine Distanz hierzu zu gering ist. Weitere Karteninformationen können benutzerdefiniert ein- und ausgeblendet werden. In der Logbuch-Funktion werden bereits durchgeführte Flüge übersichtlich dargestellt und können nachträglich bewertet und mit Details versehen werden. Weiterhin kann der Nutzer sein Profil anpassen und Drohnen hinzufügen bzw. bearbeiten."

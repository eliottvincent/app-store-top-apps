On newer devices, using device sensor is more accurate.\n\nIt also allows you to get a picture of where you are and save it in photo album. Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

      "label": "Atlas Navi is a Drive to Earn A.I. navigation app that uses live video from your smartphone camera to analyze the road in front of you and automatically detect: \n- traffic in each lane (counting how many vehicles are in each lane in front of you) \n- road construction / road work signs \n- road closures \n- accident detection \n- police vehicles (some countries only) \n- potholes \n- available / free parking space\n\nThe app uses advanced computer vision (A.I.) algorithms to analyze the video feeds from your smartphone camera and detect all the above problems on the road. It does this in the background, without interfering with the navigation instructions. \n\nAtlas Navi analyses the road 25 times per second when used with the camera from your smartphone. It generates 100 times better data than other navigation systems, which helps reroute other drivers to avoid potential traffic congestion and dangerous situations. \nBased on these A.I. detections, the app reroutes other drivers on quicker, safer, and less congested routes. \n\nAtlas Navi only uploads to the server the relevant information for traffic optimization: the type of detections and the GPS co-ordinates of said problem. No images or videos are uploaded unless specifically enabled by the user. If enabled, it can store your road trip recorded videos in the cloud, but the default option is to keep them on your device. \nAtlas Navi rewards drivers who send traffic data with a small amount of $NAVI for each mile they drive if they have a 3D vehicle selected in the app and provide traffic data from their cameras.\n\nYou can of course use Atlas Navi as a standard navigation app, without turning on the smartphone camera or the A.I. detections. You will benefit from all the rerouting and information received from other drivers which will make your route safer and faster. \n\nCurrent features include: \n- Navigation module with very accurate address search function \n- Video recording of your road trips, stored in the cloud or on the device \n- Trip history with associated videos (if any) \n- A.I. camera view - see what the camera is detecting in real time around you. \n- Livestream your road trip by sharing a simple link (the others don't need to download Atlas Navi) \n- Car garage where you can select from 3D vehicles in your garage. Customize, change their color, and choose which one you want to drive with today. \n- Rewards system - get rewarded in $NAVI if others join your Driving Club \n- Driving Club - see the others who have joined your personal club \n- Wallet - rewards earned and spent\n\nAtlas Navi is adding more features on a bi-weekly basis and will keep you updated with the latest innovation in avoiding traffic using A.I."

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

The app helps you navigate to your destination and as a cherry on top, you get to start a parking action upon arrival. All of this in a single app and throughout the whole of Europe. Making your life easier, safer and more efficient before, during and after your trip, Flitsmeister is your best friend! \n\nThere are several other ways in which Flitsmeister will make your life easier: \n\n• Mobile and fixed speed cam, speed check zone alerts; to save your hard-earned cash.   \n\n• Traffic jam alerts; check in advance whether you will be encountering a traffic jam on your route and start a new route if necessary. \n\n• Service vehicle alerts such as ambulances and fire trucks, to help you get out of the way calmly and in time so they can reach their destination more quickly.  \n\n• Accidents, roadworks, stationary vehicles and other incident alerts: allowing you to anticipate the situation safely and in time. \n\n• Matrix sign alerts: never miss a closed exit, opened rush hour lane or maximum speed instructions ever again. \n\n• Navigation: the right instructions to get from A to B, taking into account the current situation on the road or recommending a different route if disturbances are expected on your route.  \n\n• Paid parking: start a parking action upon arrival at your destination with the tap of a button. The app will recognise whether you are located in a parking zone to make sure you don’t forget to start the parking action. We will send you a notification as soon as you get back behind the wheel so you never forget to stop your parking action and never overpay. \n\n• Traffic lights: certain traffic lights in the Netherlands will send their current status to the app. The number of these ‘smart’ traffic lights will be increasing in the future, allowing us to show you a countdown for the green light and speed recommendations to keep you in the green wave. \n\n• Apple Carplay for Flitsmeister on the screen of your car: navigate to your destination even more conveniently by displaying Flitsmeister on the screen of your car. Of course, you will also keep receiving the usual alerts for speed cams, traffic jams and hazards during your trip. \n\n\nCOMMUNITY \nOur entire team is dedicated to making the app better and more complete every single day.

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Navigate your city’s public transit system with accurate real-time predictions, simple trip planning, step-by-step navigation, service disruption notifications, and departure and stop reminders... all presented in a clear, bold interface. Public transport not cooperating? Easily request a ride from Uber, Lyft or VIA, or grab the closest bikeshare.  \n\n10 GREAT THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH TRANSIT:\n1) See real-time arrivals for nearby buses and trains instantly upon launch.\n2) Watch your transit vehicle approaching on a map in real-time\n3) Compare options with powerful A to B trip plans using real-time data.\n4) Launch GO for step-by-step navigation when you’re on an unfamiliar route or want to nap/read/space out.*\n5) Receive departure alarms and stop notifications as well as prompts to pick up the pace in GO.*\n6) Get push notifications if service disruptions will affect your commute.\n7) Plan trips, view transit schedules and get route itineraries—even when you’re offline! \n8) Locate bikeshare stations, see the number of bikes available, pay for passes, and unlock bikes (in select cities). \n9) Check ETA (and price) for nearby Uber, Lyft and VIA rides, and book in two taps.\n10) Easily plan and pay for a trip combining Uber, Lyft, or VIA with transit. We call it Transit+ \n\n*continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\n5-STAR USER REVIEWS\n“Your app was the deciding factor in selling my car”\n“Blows Google Maps out of the water.” \n\"Probably the best thing on my phone, no joke.\"\n“The head of our local transit agency recommended this app over the one her agency created.”\n\"Truly ingenious work here.

Picture will be sealed with coordinates of current location along with altitude and local date/time.\n\nBarometric Pressure is calculated based on elevation. On newer devices such as iPhone 6/6+ value is being delivered directly from device built-in barometric sensor, this behavior is configurable and you can switch back to calculation mode.\n\nApp Features:\n - Elevation from see level in meter (metric) or feet (imperial)\n - Change between metric and imperial systems by tapping on reported elevation\n - Current location coordinates including latitude and longitude\n - Barometric pressure in various units extracted from device sensor or calculated from altitude\n - Water boiling point at your current location\n - Current weather information including temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed and wind bearing\n - World Altitude, get approximate altitude (elevation from see level) of any location in the world\n - Save altitude data for reference\n - Take a picture and watermark it with elevation information and share\n\nEnjoy."

You can always see your current average speed on the app.\n• Accurate alerts. \n• The alerts work with your other devices using Bluetooth. \n• Automatic start and fast installation. \n• Quick and secure operation. \n• You become part of a traffic community of more than 1,000,000 users. \n• Works abroad where you gain access to approx. 100,000 fixed speed cameras. \n\nGetting started \nAll you need to do is pair your Saphe traffic alarm with your smartphone when you use Saphe for the first time. After that, everything runs automatically – as long as Bluetooth is activated on your telephone. \nInstall your Saphe traffic alarm easily in your car within sight and reach with the accompanying installation kit – and you are ready to set off. \n\nPlease note that continuous use of GPS in the background may drain your battery faster than normal. \n\nBest regards, Team Saphe \n\nTerms and Conditions: https://saphe.com/uk/terms-conditions/\nPersonal Data Policy: https://saphe.com/uk/privacy-policy/"

If you drive a car, biking or even outdoor on a walking or hiking tour, GPX Tracker will be tracing your geo data.\nOnce developed as a creator for XCode compatible GPX formatted files, the feature list is growing but it is still as simple to use. \n\nConfiguration\nGPX Tracker has a simple configuration interface.\n* Distance Filter - specifies the minimum distance between two way points in meters.\n* Auto Stop - If you ever forget to turn off the recorder, don't mind. GPX Tracker figures out whenever you stop traveling and stops tracing your trip to save energy.\n* Reminder - If this feature is turned on, you will receive a message whenever you stop by for a few minutes to remind you on stopping the track tracing.\n\nTrip Tracking\nThe main screen has a start/stop button. Simply press this button once for tracing a new trip and a second time whenever you want to stop recording data.\nOn the top of the screen, you will see the traveled miles or kilometers depending on your locale system configuration.\nWith the menu bar item on the right side you can choose different user tracking modes for the maps. \n\nTracks\nThe Tracks screen provides a list of tracks recorded. The will show the date and time of recording, the duration of the trip and its distance.\nIf you tap on one of the trips, it will be displayed on a map. From there on, you can press the menu bar item on the right side to choose an export format and send the generated\nfile by email.\nBack in the Tracks screen, you can easily delete a recorded track by swiping the desired item from the right to the left.\n\nTrack Export Formats\nThere are two output formats available.\n* XCode compatible \"wpt\"-tag based GPX files. This format can be used for the iOS Simulator by added the generated gpx file to an XCode iOS Project.\n* Common GPX \"trk\"-tag based format. The track will consist of a collection of \"trkpt\" tags within a \"trk\" element. This format should be fine for any application that processes gpx tracks.\n\nGPX Tracker is free but ad supported. \n\nPlease note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. GPS will be stopped automatically, as soon as you stop recording a track."

      "label": "To be used in conjunction with Land Rover vehicles which are fitted with the next-generation infotainment system, InControl Touch Pro, the Land Rover Route Planner App allows you to navigate from door to door. Before setting out from your home, set your destination from your smartphone and you’ll be directed to your Land Rover as the app detects your vehicle's location. The smartphone app will then automatically sync with your Land Rover's navigation system using the Cloud so your car will be ready to take over navigating soon after you get in. Once you've finished your in-car journey, navigation is then handed back to your smartphone, which provides any final public transport and pedestrian directions to your final destination.\n\nIn addition the Route Planner app also allows you to pre-plan trips and holidays by searching for places of interest or restaurants and saving them as favourites from your smartphone. You will then be able to access these saved locations from the in-car navigation system at a later date. \n\nNote:\n• Requires InControl Navigation Account to sign-in. Account can be registered from either your Land Rover’s navigation settings or landrover.here.com.\n• As we systematically introduce InControl, specific features, options and its availability remain market dependent. This app requires that your vehicle be fitted with its relevant connectivity package as well as a Micro SIM card with a suitable data contract. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."

In addition, then the GPS reception is active in the background. This can quickly drain the battery. Using the app abroad may incur additional roaming charges if your roaming feature is enabled.

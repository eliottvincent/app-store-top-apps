      "label": "Atlas Navi is a Drive to Earn A.I. navigation app that uses live video from your smartphone camera to analyze the road in front of you and automatically detect: \n- traffic in each lane (counting how many vehicles are in each lane in front of you) \n- road construction / road work signs \n- road closures \n- accident detection \n- police vehicles (some countries only) \n- potholes \n- available / free parking space\n\nThe app uses advanced computer vision (A.I.) algorithms to analyze the video feeds from your smartphone camera and detect all the above problems on the road. It does this in the background, without interfering with the navigation instructions. \n\nAtlas Navi analyses the road 25 times per second when used with the camera from your smartphone. It generates 100 times better data than other navigation systems, which helps reroute other drivers to avoid potential traffic congestion and dangerous situations. \nBased on these A.I. detections, the app reroutes other drivers on quicker, safer, and less congested routes. \n\nAtlas Navi only uploads to the server the relevant information for traffic optimization: the type of detections and the GPS co-ordinates of said problem. No images or videos are uploaded unless specifically enabled by the user. If enabled, it can store your road trip recorded videos in the cloud, but the default option is to keep them on your device. \nAtlas Navi rewards drivers who send traffic data with a small amount of $NAVI for each mile they drive if they have a 3D vehicle selected in the app and provide traffic data from their cameras.\n\nYou can of course use Atlas Navi as a standard navigation app, without turning on the smartphone camera or the A.I. detections. You will benefit from all the rerouting and information received from other drivers which will make your route safer and faster. \n\nCurrent features include: \n- Navigation module with very accurate address search function \n- Video recording of your road trips, stored in the cloud or on the device \n- Trip history with associated videos (if any) \n- A.I. camera view - see what the camera is detecting in real time around you. \n- Livestream your road trip by sharing a simple link (the others don't need to download Atlas Navi) \n- Car garage where you can select from 3D vehicles in your garage. Customize, change their color, and choose which one you want to drive with today. \n- Rewards system - get rewarded in $NAVI if others join your Driving Club \n- Driving Club - see the others who have joined your personal club \n- Wallet - rewards earned and spent\n\nAtlas Navi is adding more features on a bi-weekly basis and will keep you updated with the latest innovation in avoiding traffic using A.I."

Just ask Alexa to hear music, news, and more. Also, enjoy Garmin turn-by-turn navigation. Stream the audio (music and other responses) from your vehicle’s stereo when you connect Garmin Speak to your stereo using Bluetooth® or AUX.\r\n \r\nOlder Bluetooth-capable Garmin navigators are compatible with the Garmin Smartphone Link app, and older Wi-Fi-enabled Garmin dash cams can access video footage through the Garmin VIRB app."

The app helps you navigate to your destination and as a cherry on top, you get to start a parking action upon arrival. All of this in a single app and throughout the whole of Europe. Making your life easier, safer and more efficient before, during and after your trip, Flitsmeister is your best friend! \n\nThere are several other ways in which Flitsmeister will make your life easier: \n\n• Mobile and fixed speed cam, speed check zone alerts; to save your hard-earned cash.   \n\n• Traffic jam alerts; check in advance whether you will be encountering a traffic jam on your route and start a new route if necessary. \n\n• Service vehicle alerts such as ambulances and fire trucks, to help you get out of the way calmly and in time so they can reach their destination more quickly.  \n\n• Accidents, roadworks, stationary vehicles and other incident alerts: allowing you to anticipate the situation safely and in time. \n\n• Matrix sign alerts: never miss a closed exit, opened rush hour lane or maximum speed instructions ever again. \n\n• Navigation: the right instructions to get from A to B, taking into account the current situation on the road or recommending a different route if disturbances are expected on your route.  \n\n• Paid parking: start a parking action upon arrival at your destination with the tap of a button. The app will recognise whether you are located in a parking zone to make sure you don’t forget to start the parking action. We will send you a notification as soon as you get back behind the wheel so you never forget to stop your parking action and never overpay. \n\n• Traffic lights: certain traffic lights in the Netherlands will send their current status to the app. The number of these ‘smart’ traffic lights will be increasing in the future, allowing us to show you a countdown for the green light and speed recommendations to keep you in the green wave. \n\n• Apple Carplay for Flitsmeister on the screen of your car: navigate to your destination even more conveniently by displaying Flitsmeister on the screen of your car. Of course, you will also keep receiving the usual alerts for speed cams, traffic jams and hazards during your trip. \n\n\nCOMMUNITY \nOur entire team is dedicated to making the app better and more complete every single day. We boast a robust community with over 1.7 million active users in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "HYPERDIA is a train timetable application that allows you to search using natural language spoken queries in either English or Japanese. For example, try a query like \"Narita Airport to Shibuya station, last train.\" The search parameters will be set automatically, providing quick access to the train timetable information you are looking for.  This can be particularly handy if you are a foreigner traveling in Japan for the first time, or simply prefer to see timetable information in English.\n\n=====================================\n[Jul 12, 2017 UPDATE]\nWe supported for 64bit architecture. \n=====================================\n\n===Using Voice Search===\nThe English language voice search system supports \"Departure station\", \"Arrival station\", \"last train\", and \"first train\" input parameters.  You may also specify time information.\n\nThe voice search functionality helps to eliminate otherwise difficult and time-consuming text input, particularly when entering the names of Japanese train stations. Voice search is also useful when you are in a hurry, or when it's awkward to input text using the built-in keypad.\n\nStations with similar pronunciations will appear as alternative candidates, making it easy to select your desired station.\n\nThe application also supports telephone-style usage. You can simply lift the phone to your ear and speak your query as if you were having a normal telephone conversation.\n\nOf course, it is also possible to specify your search parameters using the built-in keypad without using the voice functionality.\n\n===Route Search===\nSearch for all JR lines, private lines, subways, streetcars and airports is supported.\n\nInformation including the shortest route, fares, commuter fares, and links to time information and maps is shown.\n\nIt is possible to filter results based on plane routes, shinkansen, and rapid lines, as well as JR versus private railways.\n\n===Japanese version===\nBoth English and Japanese versions of the system are available. This allows the user to search the same set of nationwide Japanese stations in either English or Japanese using text or voice input. Note that the English-language voice system is tailored to American English accents.\n\n\n===30 days Free Trial===\nThe trial version of the application can be used for free for 30 days, starting from the first usage following installation.\n\nAt any time during or after the end of the 30 days trial period, you may purchase a usage coupon to continue using the application and enable the full set of available features.\n\n===Coupon===\nIn order to use HYPERDIA after the free trial period, it is necessary to obtain a coupon by making an In App purchase.\n\nFour different types of coupons are available. (Prices subject to change.)\n  * Japanese (1 month) - $1.99\n  * Japanese (1 year)  - $16.99\n  * Japanese + English (1 month) - $2.99\n  * Japanese + English (1 year)  - $25.99\n\nPlease be aware that if you purchase a \"Japanese + English\" coupon when you already have a valid \"Japanese\" coupon, the \"Japanese\" coupon will become invalid. \n\nWARNING:\nIn order to use this application, a stable Internet connection (3G, WiFi, etc.) is required.\n\nPlease note that, although great care and effort have been taken in the development of this application, it is possible, due to circumstances beyond our control, that fare and/or time information may occasionally be incorrect."

The all-new WalkSafe+ app provides safety at your fingertips, giving you the tools to make informed decisions about your personal safety. \n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n- Journey planner: Plan your journeys and save your favourite locations for easy access.\n\n- Trusted friend circle: Build a trusted circle of friends who can view your location and share their own journeys. No one outside of your trusted circle will be able to see your location, not strangers or big brother.\n\n- Street crime reports: Visualise serious street crime reports as icons with the WalkSafe Map, all information is based on verified police crime data. \n\n- Community safety: Help others by posting safety icons to the WalkSafe map. All community icons are verified by admins to uphold user safety.\n\n- Hotspot Alerts: Get alerts when you walk near areas that have seen reports of serious crimes such as knife attacks, sexual assault, violent attacks and muggings.\n\n- SOS button: Alert ALL of your trusted friends even if they are not viewing your location.\n\nPERSONAL SAFETY TOOLS\n\nNo one can predict where the next crime will be. However, we believe being informed and staying alert is the key to staying safer.\n\nWe use up-to-date, accurate, and verified police data, empowering you with street safety information. The app will help you choose the safest routes while walking, spot patterns in criminal behaviour, and stay safe.\n\n- HomeSafe: Protect yourself and protect others with HomeSafe. Set a specific place and a specific time, and share your journey plan with loved ones. If you don't successfully complete your journey, your loved ones are notified. (This feature is non-location sharing).\n\n- WalkSafe Journeys: Going somewhere? WalkSafe journeys differ from HomeSafe by allowing you to share your location with your trusted friends. Your location will update in real-time allowing your loved ones to keep you safe on your journey.\n\n- Activity Map: Our map shows police and WalkSafe community reports of dangers such as knife crime, sexual assault & mugging​​. WalkSafe automatically alerts you when you walk near these dangers. Use this information to plan safer routes and post live updates in your local area. Be a part of the growing community to stay informed and safer. \n\nWho is it for? \n\n- Students & International Students\n- Out of hours workers\n- Singles in the city \n- Parents with teenage children \n- Female professionals \n- Groups with increased vulnerability \n\n***IMPORTANT*** \n\nCurrently, there is no data provided for Manchester or Scotland.\n\nRelevant links \n \n- Website: https://www.walksafe.io/   \n- FAQ: https://www.walksafe.io/faq \n- Privacy Policy: https://www.walksafe.io/privacypolicy  \n- Terms & Conditions: https://www.walksafe.io/websitetermsandcondition"

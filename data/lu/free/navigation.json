That's why Moovit has been named one of the best apps of the year in 2017 by the App Store.\n\nMoovit is your personal assistant for all your transit rides! \n\n► Real-time arrivals. View real-time arrival information, which is taken directly from GPS devices positioned on buses and trains. Avoid wasting time guessing train times or bus times.\n\n► Digital payment. Purchase bus & train tickets and validate your digital pass with a tap (select cities). \n\n► Real time alerts. Know about issues ahead of time by receiving service alerts such as emergency or unexpected disruptions, delays, traffic jams, new construction, and more so that you can plan ahead if your bus time or train time changed.\n\n► Live Directions. Get step-by-step bus directions and other transit directions with live guidance from A-to-B: Know how long you need to walk to your station, view your line's arrival time, receive get-off alerts as you approach your destination, and more. \n\n► Visualize Your Stop. Use augmented reality to locate your bus or train stop with \"Way Finder\".\n\n► User reports. Moovit’s users report issues found with stations, line service, and schedules so that we can inform all nearby riders about what’s going on in their area.\n\n► Favorite lines, stations, and places. Get easy access to lines, stations, and places you ride and visit all the time. Plus, get real-time updates if/when there are changes to your favorite lines in case your bus time or train time is impacted!\n\n► Bike routes. Get bike routes in addition to the bus, subway, train, or metro trip plans. If you ride bikes (yours or shared) we can plan a route that includes the train or bus. Moovit will help you plan a trip that meets your transit-needs. Bike docking stations are updated in real-time. Bike trip plans are only available in supported metro areas.\n\n► Maps view. Interested in seeing the whole picture? View all stations, routes, and lines on the subway or bus map. Additionally, maps are available in PDF for when you’re offline, or underground on the subway. \n\nMoovit is the #1 urban mobility app in the world. We’re proud to collaborate with public transit agencies across the United States, including:\nMTA\nNJ Transit\nMBTA\nSEPTA\nLA Metro\nSFMTA Muni\nBART\nCaltrain\nCTA\nMetra\nWMATA\nMTA Maryland\nTriMet\nSound Transit\nSARTA\nPARTA\n\nYou only need one app on your phone to navigate nearby buses and transit in the U.S. and across 112 other countries and in 45 languages. If you’d like to know bus times and train times all around the world or if you need to find out when the last bus leaves a certain bus stop Moovit has you covered. You ride, we guide!\n\nContact us: \n* https://support.moovitapp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=175869\n* https://www.facebook.com/moovit\n* https://twitter.com/moovit\n\nTerms of Use\nhttps://moovitapp.com/en-us/legal/terms-of-service-en"

      "label": "GPX Tracker is a simple to use but powerful tool that helps you to track your ways. If you drive a car, biking or even outdoor on a walking or hiking tour, GPX Tracker will be tracing your geo data.\nOnce developed as a creator for XCode compatible GPX formatted files, the feature list is growing but it is still as simple to use. \n\nConfiguration\nGPX Tracker has a simple configuration interface.\n* Distance Filter - specifies the minimum distance between two way points in meters.\n* Auto Stop - If you ever forget to turn off the recorder, don't mind. GPX Tracker figures out whenever you stop traveling and stops tracing your trip to save energy.\n* Reminder - If this feature is turned on, you will receive a message whenever you stop by for a few minutes to remind you on stopping the track tracing.\n\nTrip Tracking\nThe main screen has a start/stop button. Simply press this button once for tracing a new trip and a second time whenever you want to stop recording data.\nOn the top of the screen, you will see the traveled miles or kilometers depending on your locale system configuration.\nWith the menu bar item on the right side you can choose different user tracking modes for the maps. \n\nTracks\nThe Tracks screen provides a list of tracks recorded. The will show the date and time of recording, the duration of the trip and its distance.\nIf you tap on one of the trips, it will be displayed on a map. From there on, you can press the menu bar item on the right side to choose an export format and send the generated\nfile by email.\nBack in the Tracks screen, you can easily delete a recorded track by swiping the desired item from the right to the left.\n\nTrack Export Formats\nThere are two output formats available.\n* XCode compatible \"wpt\"-tag based GPX files. This format can be used for the iOS Simulator by added the generated gpx file to an XCode iOS Project.\n* Common GPX \"trk\"-tag based format. The track will consist of a collection of \"trkpt\" tags within a \"trk\" element. This format should be fine for any application that processes gpx tracks.\n\nGPX Tracker is free but ad supported. \n\nPlease note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. GPS will be stopped automatically, as soon as you stop recording a track."

This may incur costs in line with the contract between the customer and their mobile provider (e.g. for roaming).\r\n•\tPlease note that the functionality of your smartphone and the connection to the vehicle also depend on national requirements and factors; BMW Motorrad therefore cannot guarantee that it will be available at all times.\r\n•\tThe BMW Motorrad Connected app will be displayed in the language you have set for your smartphone.

Colour coded icons make identification easy too.\n\nIf you like this app you'll love the full version of Ship Finder.\n\nThe full version includes a huge array of additional features including route history, search, filters, bookmarks, photos, the ability to add favourite ships and much more.\n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation."

      "label": "Map, Track, Sync and Share Your Trek From Anywhere\n\nFor adventure seekers, explorers and outdoor enthusiasts, the Garmin Explore ecosystem offers a complete mobile navigation solution that  — when paired with a compatible Garmin device¹ — lets you map, track and navigate your trek from anywhere with unlimited cloud storage.\n\nGarmin Explore provides basic trip planning or viewing of maps you’ve preloaded on your device. Or you can use the mobile app to pair your smart device via BLUETOOTH®² technology with a compatible Garmin GPS device, so you can do and see even more.\n\nAccess Online Connectivity \n\nGarmin Explore provides free online access to a wide range of additional capabilities. For example, you can download detailed topographic maps, color aerial imagery and other navigation aids directly to your mobile device. The maps and navigation data loaded onto your device can be used anywhere, anytime — even when you’re out beyond the reach of cellphone towers or internet connections.\n\nManage Your Collections, Tracks and Routes\n\nReview and edit your waypoints, tracks, routes and activities in your library. Add them to a collection to keep all the recorded data from a certain trip together in one place. For example, if you’re taking a long trip, you can plan different waypoints, tracks and routes for each day of the trip and combine them into one collection.\n\nYour Mobile Cloud Connection\r\n\nThe Garmin Explore app will send and store the waypoints, planned routes, GPS tracks and Garmin activities you've recorded in the cloud, allowing you to access and use that data on the Garmin Explore web site to plan or review your adventures. You can also sync your cloud-stored data with a compatible Garmin device. A Garmin account is needed to store your data in the cloud. Your activities (e.g., runs, walks, hikes, etc.) include data such as distance, pace, activity time, location, etc. that were recorded by your device.\r\n\nMore Off-grid Capability with inReach® Technology\n\nUse Garmin Explore with your inReach enabled devices, such as the GPSMAP® 66i navigator and satellite communicator, to turn your mobile device into a true off-the-grid satellite companion. In an emergency, you can trigger an interactive SOS to the GEOS 24/7 emergency response team. Two-way messaging and LiveTrack location tracking via the 100% global Iridium® satellite network let you stay in contact globally. The Garmin Explore app allows you to access your phone’s contact list for easier messaging and sharing when connected.\n\nWhat You Get with Garmin Explore\n\n• Unlimited map downloads; access topographic maps, USGS quad sheets and more\n• Aerial imagery\n• Waypoints, tracking and route navigation\n• High-detail GPS trip logging and location sharing\n• Unlimited cloud storage of routes, waypoints, tracks, and activities\n• Online trip planning\n\n1. https://explore.garmin.com/appcompatibility\n\n2.

Stay tuned for more cities ;)\n\nStill don't have Parclick on your phone? Download the app for free and discover a cheap and easy way to park!"

Allows to setup unlimited number of tariffs, and charge for distance driven or time passed (or both). Provides trip extras management, so extras can be added or removed with one tap.\n\n+UNLIMITED NUMBER OF TARIFFS. Each tariff allows to charge either for distance (miles or kilometers) or for time. It is even possible to charge for time only when speed drops under some configurable value.\n\n+TRIPS LOG, STATS, RECEIPTS. Everything you need for billing and book keeping.\n\n+FLEXIBLE EXTRAS. You can define your extras in advance and add to the trip easily or you can add arbitrary extra amounts to the trip as you drive. You can review trip extras at any moment to remove or edit them.\n\n+ONE TAP TARIFFS SWITCH. You can pick which tariffs to see in the tariffs switch panel and switch with one tap between them.\n\n+CONFIGURABLE NUMBER OF DECIMAL PLACES IN TAXI FARE. Setup speedometer to show 1 or 2 decimal places in a taxi fare, or no decimals at all.\n\n+SQUARE PAYMENTS AND PRINTING. Integrates with Square Point Of Sale app for secure  payments (including credit cards) and also for receipt printing. *Square integration requires in-app upgrade.\n\n+BUILT-IN SPEEDOMETER. As you often need to know the speed when you drive. \n\n+ UNIVERSAL APP. No need to pay twice! Taximeter works on iPhones and cellular iPads. All in retina graphics. Side by side and split view is supported on iPads, so you can run navigation apps side by side with taximeter!\n\n+ BACKGROUND MODE! Taximeter automatically works in background when taxi trip is active. You can use other apps while taximeter does its job in the background!\n\nFREE version provides you with 10 taxi trips. If you need more taxi trips please upgrade. If you've ever purchased the paid app or upgraded, please use \"Restore purchases\" button.\n\n! You can use this app on your iPhone as well as on any cellular iPad. **App will not work properly on iPods and wifi only iPads as they don't have GPS (external GPS module is required). \n\n! Please note that as with all GPS apps, continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the same cost as your original purchase.\n\n\nTIPS FOR MAPPING ROUTES\n• For longer routes, try zooming in and mapping your route in multiple segments.\n• Tap and hold the map to quickly route between waypoints and POIs.\n• Did Footpath snap to the wrong roads? Trace over the incorrect segment to edit, or use the eraser tool.\n• Turn off snap to roads (magnet icon) and zoom in to manually trace the map. (Try switching to a satellite layer).\n• Displaying maps and continuously running GPS in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Navigate without maps or with the screen off for all day battery life.\n\n\nCONTACT US\nWe've got a lot planned for Footpath.

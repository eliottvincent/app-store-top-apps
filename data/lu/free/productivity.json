      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each."

Back up and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

      "label": "The most simple and useful Calendar app ever! When it comes to calendar apps, simple calendar is the best choice! We pursued a simple and easy design throughout the app.\n\nWith an emphasis on simplicity, Simple Calendar is super easy to navigate, and with various customizing features including font size, you can use it in the style that suits you best.\n\nIt's perfect for those looking for a minimalist calendar app focused on functionality instead of extra (and sometimes unnecessary) features. Simple calendar has been receiving the highest ratings among users, plus it's FREE! Give it a try right now.\n\n[List of functions]\n· 6 Widgets\n· Font size adjustment (10 sizes)\n· Weekly calendar (7 days · 5 days · 3 days) Display\n· Supports daily calendar\n· Color coding for different calendars\n· Enter notes, URLs and maps\n· Link with other scheduling apps\n· Headlines last for days for easy viewing\n· Set your favorite day of the week as a holiday\n· Change the start day of the week\n· Lock with passcode\n\n\n[Function Details]\n\n■ iOS calendar\nThis app uses the iOS calendar app. Schedules made with this app will be synchronized with other scheduling apps and the iOS standard calendar.\n\n■ Adjust font size\nYou can choose from five font sizes of extra-small, small, medium, large, and extra-large.\nYou can also pick between light and bold font, to make prioritized events pop up better.\n\n■ Monthly, weekly, and daily calendar\nWith one tap at the bottom of the screen, you can switch between monthly, weekly, and daily display.\nSwitching the weekly calendar between 7, 5  or 3 day display allows you to find the display that is right for you.\nBecause the app memorizes the calendar style used the last time you opened it, it's super convenient for people who only want to use the weekly display.\n\n■ Color coding\nYou can create separate calendars according to different schedules such as work and home. And then, manage them clearly by color coding them. You can switch the background color between white and black as well.\n\n■ Secure passcode lock\nYou can lock the app with a password securely, if you don't want people to see your calendars. Of course, it corresponds to Face ID, Touch ID as well.\n\n■ Notification settings\nYou can set up notifications for scheduled events, at the event time and also 5 min, 15min, or more prior to the event so you don't miss important plans!\n\n\n[Note to users]\nSince this calendar app uses the standard function of the iOS calendar, all schedules older than one month may disappear with the default setting. This also applies to other apps. If you want to keep past events, please follow the procedures below after installing the app.\n\n1. Open the iOS Settings app.\n2. Tap \"Calendar\".\n3. Tap \"Sync\".\n4. Select \"All Events\".\n\nThis should solve the problem.\nIf you still have questions, visit the \"Help · FAQ\" page from the app for further details.\n\n\n【Help/Inquiries】\nPlease visit \"Help · FAQ\" from the setting screen of the app. If this doesn't help, please contact us through \"Inquiry / feedback\" from the setting screen. We can respond to you much quicker this way, so please do so instead of asking us questions in the app review, since it takes a while for those to be reflected onto the page."

      "label": "Tiimo is a visual daily planning app that helps you organize your life, stick to your routines, and work towards your personal goals.  \n\nYou can use it at home, in school and at work to support you in doing the things you need to do, in a visual and motivating way! Tiimo leverages the fact that visual information is considerably more effective than written information for many.\n\nTiimo is designed to be inclusive and helpful across neurodiversity, including for Autistic people and/or those with ADHD, and support executive function challenges like planning, organization, time management, and focus. Our features specifically support these areas. \n\n** KEY FEATURES ** \n\n+ A visual timeline supports time management and focus. \n\n+ Visual checklists help you keep track of each point on your list not only by text but also by using colours, emojis or icons. \n\n+ Ongoing reminders (notifications, vibrations and sound) halfway through and at the end of activities increase motivation and help with transitions.\n\n+ Pre-made routines, designed with common activities, that make scheduling faster.\n\n+ Choose between +3000 icons, including unique background colours, emojis, as well as the option to upload your own images.\n\n+ Joint-use function means the app can easily be used between family members, or an adult and a child. \n\n+ With one Tiimo subscription you can create up to five different profiles/schedules.\n\n+ NEW: Calendar integration with iCal (and others if synced), color theme picker, dark mode and flexible activities that you can \"play\", \"pause\" and \"resume\".\n\n** OUR USERS SAY ** \n\n“This app is a godsend. I used to use a planner to get through each day but a planner doesn’t notify you if you forget to check it. I highly recommend this for anyone on the spectrum or even if you just struggle with executive functioning skills.”\n\n“I just wanted to take a minute to say how incredible I think this app is! As a visual learner, this has such an engaging structure that makes it reliable and causes me so much less stress when I’m trying to stay organized.  I have already recommended this app to multiple people/platforms!’’\n\n“Tiimo makes me feel “in control” because I’m able to see my day visually, and I can build up a library of routines to make scheduling a breeze. I always know what is coming next which reduces anxiety and helps me focus on what I am currently doing. The power of Tiimo is that they know their audience and build specifically for them. This makes such a difference. They listen and respond promptly, I can tell that they care about the community they build their app for. I’m excited to see this app evolve even more in the future.\"\n\nGet started with Tiimo today! \n\n- We financially support neurodivergent partners & creators\n- We are a small company on a mission to make a big difference\n- We are 100% ad free and proud of it\n\n** Price & General Terms ** \n\nTiimo offers a basic free version of the app, and a paid version with full access to all the Tiimo features. When you have chosen one of our plans and confirmed your purchase, the payment will be withdrawn from the credit card via your App Store-account after the trial ends. \n\nRenewal: Your subscription automatically renews unless you unsubscribe at least 24 hours before the end of your subscription period. You can always manage your subscription by going to the settings on your device after the purchase. \n\nWhen you subscribe for a year, we know you’ll be a customer for longer, so we can make Tiimo as affordable as it possibly can be. \n\n** SAY HI TO US ** \n\nFacebook, Instagram, TikTok or Twitter: @tiimoapp \n\nTerms of Use: \nOur detailed terms of service can be read here: https://www.tiimoapp.com/terms-of-use"

The app takes your current location and uses the relevant criteria to filter the search.\n● Managing parcels: the practical overview helps you to manage your parcels and shows you the current status of your shipments at any time, together with other details. Information about parcels already delivered is automatically stored in your archive and can be referred to at a later stage.\n● Access anywhere and at any time: register for an account and you will be able to check on the current status of your parcels at any time and from any location."

      "label": "MyFRITZ!App offers you secure and easy access to your FRITZ!Box and home network at home or on the go. The app notifies you within seconds about calls, voice messages, and other events. Enjoy mobile access to the photos, music and other data stored on your FRITZ!Box from anywhere. Use the app to conveniently control your call diversions, smart home plugs and thermostats, answering machines, and other home network devices connected with your FRITZ!Box. If you want to change any settings, simply use the app to open the user interface - from wherever you are.\n\nPrerequisite for using the MyFRITZ!App: FRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 6.50 or higher.\nPrerequisite for full scope of functions of the MyFRITZ!App: FRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 7.29 or higher.\n\nIf you also want to use all of the functions when you are on the go, the FRITZ!Box must be connected to the internet and have a public IPv4 address.\n\n \nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I log into a different FRITZ!Box?\n\nMyFRITZ!App can be used with several FRITZ!Box products. If you want to switch to a different FRITZ!Box, select the desired FRITZ!Box in the app settings (gear) or tap \"Add another FRITZ!Box\" to register the new FRITZ!Box. To register a new FRITZ!Box, you must be connected to that FRITZ!Box's wireless network.\n\nQuestion: Why can I no longer switch my wireless network and my guest network using the app?\n\nSeveral FRITZ!Boxes (for instance, the FRITZ!Box 7490) require FRITZ!OS 7.10, which is currently not available for all FRITZ!Boxes.\n\nQuestion: Why can't I access my FRITZ!Box when I am away from home?\n\nIf you want to change the settings, you must be connected to your FRITZ!Box's wireless network. Make sure that you enabled \"Enable use from on the go\" in the app's settings.\nIf you also want to access the FRITZ!Box user interface from on the go, a FRITZ!Box user who has been granted the right \"Access from the Internet allowed\" must be configured.\n\nSome internet service providers (including many cable providers) provide connections that do not allow you to access the home connection from the internet or certain restrictions apply because no public IPv4 address is provided. MyFRITZ!App normally recognizes that type of connection automatically and displays a corresponding message. These types of connections are called \"DS-Lite\", \"Dual-Stack-Lite\" or \"Carrier Grade NAT\" (CGN). You can ask your provider whether it would be possible to receive a public IPv4 address.\n\nQuestion: What can I do if there is no update to FRITZ!OS 6.50 or later for my FRITZ!Box?\n\nUnfortunately, in this case you cannot use the MyFRITZ!App.\n\nQuestion: If I have suggestions for improving the app or discover an error, how can I tell AVM?\n\nWe always welcome feedback! Open the app settings (gear) and tap \"Give Feedback\" to send us a brief message. A log is automatically attached to your message; this also helps us to analyze errors."

Used by millions worldwide, our all-new email app protects your communications and has everything you need to easily manage your inbox.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says:\n“Proton Mail offers encrypted email, which makes it virtually impossible for anyone to read it except the sender and the recipient.”\n\nWith the all-new Proton Mail app, you can:\n• Create a @proton.me or @protonmail.com email address \n• Send and receive encrypted emails and attachments with ease\n• Switch between multiple Proton Mail accounts\n• Easily manage your email with conversations\n• Keep your inbox tidy and clean with folders, labels and simple swipe-gestures\n• Receive new email notifications\n• Send Password-protected Emails to anyone\n• Enjoy your inbox in dark mode\n\nWhy use Proton Mail?\n• Proton Mail is free — We believe everyone deserves privacy. Upgrade to a paid plan to get more done and support our mission. \n• Easy to use — Our all-new app has been redesigned to make it easier to read, organize, and write your emails.\n• Your inbox is yours — We don’t spy on your communications to show you targeted ads. Your inbox, your rules.\n• Rigorous encryption — Your entire inbox is secured, on all your devices. No one can read your emails but you. Proton is privacy, guaranteed by end-to-end and zero-access encryption.\n• Unmatched protection — We offer strong phishing, spam, and spying/tracking protection for all your communications.\n\nIndustry Leading Security Features\nMessages are stored on Proton Mail servers using end-to-end encryption at all times and are transmitted securely between Proton servers and user devices. This largely eliminates the risk of message interception.\n\nZero Access to Your Email Content\nProton Mail's zero access architecture means that your data is encrypted in a way that makes it inaccessible to us. Data is encrypted on the client side using an encryption key that Proton does not have access to. This means we don't have the technical ability to decrypt your messages.\n\nOpen-Source Cryptography\nProton Mail's open-source software has been thoroughly vetted by security experts from around the world to ensure the highest levels of protection. Proton Mail only uses secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP, while all of the cryptographic libraries used are open source. By using open-source libraries, Proton Mail can guarantee that the encryption algorithms used do not have clandestinely built-in back doors.\n\nProton Mail in the press:\n“Proton Mail is a Gmail-like email system which uses end-to-end encryption, making it impossible for outside parties to monitor.” Forbes\n\n“A new email service being developed by a group who met at MIT and CERN promises to bring secure, encrypted email to the masses and keep sensitive information away from prying eyes.” Huffington Post\n\nFollow Proton on social media for all the latest news and offers:\nFacebook: /proton\nTwitter: @protonprivacy\nReddit: /protonmail\nInstagram: /protonprivacy\n\nFor more information, visit: https://proton.me/mail\nOur open-source code base: https://github.com/ProtonMail"

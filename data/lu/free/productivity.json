      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

Each of them knows: Good rehearsals are the basis for every successful performance.\n\nAn area with room for improvement is well structured and understandable scheduling for rehearsals and performances.\nThe App Konzertmeister supports orchestras and choirs precisely in this challenge.\n\nIn many associations it is common for appointments to be communicated via various channels: SMS, e-mail, WhatsApp or Facebook are often to be found here. This variety of communication paths often makes it difficult for everyone involved to maintain an overview.\n\nKonzertmeister aims to provide a simple and direct way to remedy this - it offers its members a clearly structured schedule with a direct opportunity to RSVP with just one click.\n\nThis attendance information is immediately visible to the musical director, who is always able to observe the expected attendance status on their created appointments.\nThus, the leader knows at any time which rehearsal or performance will be well attended and can adjust their planning accordingly.\n\nFor more detailed structuring, members can be divided into sections and so also part or section rehearsals are easily defined.\nFurthermore, there is also the possibility to import Konzertmeister appointments in a personal calendar and therefore also available outside the app at any time."

      "label": "MyFRITZ!App offers you secure and easy access to your FRITZ!Box and home network at home or on the go. The app notifies you within seconds about calls, voice messages, and other events. Enjoy mobile access to the photos, music and other data stored on your FRITZ!Box from anywhere. Use the app to conveniently control your call diversions, smart home plugs and thermostats, answering machines, and other home network devices connected with your FRITZ!Box. If you want to change any settings, simply use the app to open the user interface - from wherever you are.\n\nPrerequisite for using the MyFRITZ!App: FRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 6.50 or higher.\nPrerequisite for full scope of functions of the MyFRITZ!App: FRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 7.29 or higher.\n\nIf you also want to use all of the functions when you are on the go, the FRITZ!Box must be connected to the internet and have a public IPv4 address.\n\n \nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I log into a different FRITZ!Box?\n\nMyFRITZ!App can be used with several FRITZ!Box products. If you want to switch to a different FRITZ!Box, select the desired FRITZ!Box in the app settings (gear) or tap \"Add another FRITZ!Box\" to register the new FRITZ!Box. To register a new FRITZ!Box, you must be connected to that FRITZ!Box's wireless network.\n\nQuestion: Why can I no longer switch my wireless network and my guest network using the app?\n\nSeveral FRITZ!Boxes (for instance, the FRITZ!Box 7490) require FRITZ!OS 7.10, which is currently not available for all FRITZ!Boxes.\n\nQuestion: Why can't I access my FRITZ!Box when I am away from home?\n\nIf you want to change the settings, you must be connected to your FRITZ!Box's wireless network. Make sure that you enabled \"Enable use from on the go\" in the app's settings.\nIf you also want to access the FRITZ!Box user interface from on the go, a FRITZ!Box user who has been granted the right \"Access from the Internet allowed\" must be configured.\n\nSome internet service providers (including many cable providers) provide connections that do not allow you to access the home connection from the internet or certain restrictions apply because no public IPv4 address is provided. MyFRITZ!App normally recognizes that type of connection automatically and displays a corresponding message. These types of connections are called \"DS-Lite\", \"Dual-Stack-Lite\" or \"Carrier Grade NAT\" (CGN). You can ask your provider whether it would be possible to receive a public IPv4 address.\n\nQuestion: What can I do if there is no update to FRITZ!OS 6.50 or later for my FRITZ!Box?\n\nUnfortunately, in this case you cannot use the MyFRITZ!App.\n\nQuestion: If I have suggestions for improving the app or discover an error, how can I tell AVM?\n\nWe always welcome feedback! Open the app settings (gear) and tap \"Give Feedback\" to send us a brief message. A log is automatically attached to your message; this also helps us to analyze errors."

Share folders with your contacts and see their updates in real time.\n\nMEGA’s strong and secure end-to-end encryption means we cannot access or reset your password. You MUST remember your password and make sure to back up your account Recovery Key. Losing your password and the account Recovery Key will result in lost access to your files.\n\nUse the included MEGA Secure Chat for end-to-end-encrypted communications, including video and audio calls, with total privacy. Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency.

You can cancel the automatic renewal of your MEGA Pro subscription no later than 24 hours before your next subscription payment is due, via your iTunes account settings page. To manage your subscriptions, tap on the App Store icon on your device, sign in with your Apple ID at the bottom of the page (if you haven’t already done so) and then tap View ID. You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions. From there, you can select your MEGA Pro subscription and view your scheduled renewal date, choose a different subscription package or toggle the on-off switch to off to disable the auto-renewal of your subscription.\n\nTerms of Service: https://mega.io/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://mega.io/privacy"

Planner makes it easy for your team to create new plans, organize and assign tasks, share files, chat about what you’re working on, and get updates on progress.\n\n-- Organize work visually --\nEach plan has its own board, where you can organize tasks into buckets. You can categorize tasks based on their status or on whom they’re assigned to. To update the status or change assignments, just drag and drop tasks between columns.\n\n-- Visibility --\nThe My Tasks view provides a comprehensive list of all your tasks and their status across all your plans. When working together on a plan, team members always know who is working on what.\n\n-- Collaborate --\nBuilt for Office 365, Planner lets you work together on the same tasks, attach captured photos directly to them, and even have conversations around tasks without switching between apps. With Planner, all your team’s discussions and deliverables stay with the plan and don’t get locked away across disparate applications.\n\n-- Works across devices --\nPlanner works across all your devices.

      "label": "The most simple and useful Calendar app ever! When it comes to calendar apps, simple calendar is the best choice! We pursued a simple and easy design throughout the app.\n\nWith an emphasis on simplicity, Simple Calendar is super easy to navigate, and with various customizing features including font size, you can use it in the style that suits you best.\n\nIt's perfect for those looking for a minimalist calendar app focused on functionality instead of extra (and sometimes unnecessary) features. Simple calendar has been receiving the highest ratings among users, plus it's FREE! Give it a try right now.\n\n[List of functions]\n· 6 Widgets\n· Font size adjustment (10 sizes)\n· Weekly calendar (7 days · 5 days · 3 days) Display\n· Supports daily calendar\n· Color coding for different calendars\n· Enter notes, URLs and maps\n· Link with other scheduling apps\n· Headlines last for days for easy viewing\n· Set your favorite day of the week as a holiday\n· Change the start day of the week\n· Lock with passcode\n\n\n[Function Details]\n\n■ iOS calendar\nThis app uses the iOS calendar app. Schedules made with this app will be synchronized with other scheduling apps and the iOS standard calendar.\n\n■ Adjust font size\nYou can choose from five font sizes of extra-small, small, medium, large, and extra-large.\nYou can also pick between light and bold font, to make prioritized events pop up better.\n\n■ Monthly, weekly, and daily calendar\nWith one tap at the bottom of the screen, you can switch between monthly, weekly, and daily display.\nSwitching the weekly calendar between 7, 5  or 3 day display allows you to find the display that is right for you.\nBecause the app memorizes the calendar style used the last time you opened it, it's super convenient for people who only want to use the weekly display.\n\n■ Color coding\nYou can create separate calendars according to different schedules such as work and home. And then, manage them clearly by color coding them. You can switch the background color between white and black as well.\n\n■ Secure passcode lock\nYou can lock the app with a password securely, if you don't want people to see your calendars. Of course, it corresponds to Face ID, Touch ID as well.\n\n■ Notification settings\nYou can set up notifications for scheduled events, at the event time and also 5 min, 15min, or more prior to the event so you don't miss important plans!\n\n\n[Note to users]\nSince this calendar app uses the standard function of the iOS calendar, all schedules older than one month may disappear with the default setting. This also applies to other apps. If you want to keep past events, please follow the procedures below after installing the app.\n\n1. Open the iOS Settings app.\n2. Tap \"Calendar\".\n3. Tap \"Sync\".\n4. Select \"All Events\".\n\nThis should solve the problem.\nIf you still have questions, visit the \"Help · FAQ\" page from the app for further details.\n\n\n【Help/Inquiries】\nPlease visit \"Help · FAQ\" from the setting screen of the app. If this doesn't help, please contact us through \"Inquiry / feedback\" from the setting screen. We can respond to you much quicker this way, so please do so instead of asking us questions in the app review, since it takes a while for those to be reflected onto the page."

Mobileraker started as a small side project with the intention to be able to control My 3D printer via My phone. After posting some screenshots of the app to the 3D printing community, the public interest in Mobileraker grew, and I published it to the app stores. \nAs I am only able to work on Mobileraker in my free time, I am always thankful for support and feedback. Either via lovely messages of people enjoying Mobileraker, good reviews in the store or through donations. I hope you enjoy Mobileraker and happy printing!\n\nMore information can be found on Mobilerakers GitHub page!"

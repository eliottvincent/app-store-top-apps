      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

Losing your password and the account Recovery Key will result in lost access to your files.\n\nUse the included MEGA Secure Chat for end-to-end-encrypted communications, including video and audio calls, with total privacy. Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency. The code of our iOS mobile app is located at: https://github.com/meganz/ios\n\nSubscriptions renew automatically for successive periods of the same duration at the same price as the initial period chosen. You can cancel the automatic renewal of your MEGA Pro subscription no later than 24 hours before your next subscription payment is due, via your iTunes account settings page. To manage your subscriptions, tap on the App Store icon on your device, sign in with your Apple ID at the bottom of the page (if you haven’t already done so) and then tap View ID. You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions. From there, you can select your MEGA Pro subscription and view your scheduled renewal date, choose a different subscription package or toggle the on-off switch to off to disable the auto-renewal of your subscription.\n\nTerms of Service: https://mega.io/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://mega.io/privacy"

      "label": "MyFRITZ!App offers you secure and easy access to your FRITZ!Box and home network at home or on the go. The app notifies you within seconds about calls, voice messages, and other events. Enjoy mobile access to the photos, music and other data stored on your FRITZ!Box from anywhere. Use the app to conveniently control your call diversions, smart home plugs and thermostats, answering machines, and other home network devices connected with your FRITZ!Box. If you want to change any settings, simply use the app to open the user interface - from wherever you are.\n\nPrerequisite for using the MyFRITZ!App: FRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 6.50 or higher.\nPrerequisite for full scope of functions of the MyFRITZ!App: FRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 7.29 or higher.\n\nIf you also want to use all of the functions when you are on the go, the FRITZ!Box must be connected to the internet and have a public IPv4 address.\n\n \nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I log into a different FRITZ!Box?\n\nMyFRITZ!App can be used with several FRITZ!Box products. If you want to switch to a different FRITZ!Box, select the desired FRITZ!Box in the app settings (gear) or tap \"Add another FRITZ!Box\" to register the new FRITZ!Box. To register a new FRITZ!Box, you must be connected to that FRITZ!Box's wireless network.\n\nQuestion: Why can I no longer switch my wireless network and my guest network using the app?\n\nSeveral FRITZ!Boxes (for instance, the FRITZ!Box 7490) require FRITZ!OS 7.10, which is currently not available for all FRITZ!Boxes.\n\nQuestion: Why can't I access my FRITZ!Box when I am away from home?\n\nIf you want to change the settings, you must be connected to your FRITZ!Box's wireless network. Make sure that you enabled \"Enable use from on the go\" in the app's settings.\nIf you also want to access the FRITZ!Box user interface from on the go, a FRITZ!Box user who has been granted the right \"Access from the Internet allowed\" must be configured.\n\nSome internet service providers (including many cable providers) provide connections that do not allow you to access the home connection from the internet or certain restrictions apply because no public IPv4 address is provided. MyFRITZ!App normally recognizes that type of connection automatically and displays a corresponding message. These types of connections are called \"DS-Lite\", \"Dual-Stack-Lite\" or \"Carrier Grade NAT\" (CGN). You can ask your provider whether it would be possible to receive a public IPv4 address.\n\nQuestion: What can I do if there is no update to FRITZ!OS 6.50 or later for my FRITZ!Box?\n\nUnfortunately, in this case you cannot use the MyFRITZ!App.\n\nQuestion: If I have suggestions for improving the app or discover an error, how can I tell AVM?\n\nWe always welcome feedback! Open the app settings (gear) and tap \"Give Feedback\" to send us a brief message. A log is automatically attached to your message; this also helps us to analyze errors."

Each of them knows: Good rehearsals are the basis for every successful performance.\n\nAn area with room for improvement is well structured and understandable scheduling for rehearsals and performances.\nThe App Konzertmeister supports orchestras and choirs precisely in this challenge.\n\nIn many associations it is common for appointments to be communicated via various channels: SMS, e-mail, WhatsApp or Facebook are often to be found here. This variety of communication paths often makes it difficult for everyone involved to maintain an overview.\n\nKonzertmeister aims to provide a simple and direct way to remedy this - it offers its members a clearly structured schedule with a direct opportunity to RSVP with just one click.\n\nThis attendance information is immediately visible to the musical director, who is always able to observe the expected attendance status on their created appointments.\nThus, the leader knows at any time which rehearsal or performance will be well attended and can adjust their planning accordingly.\n\nFor more detailed structuring, members can be divided into sections and so also part or section rehearsals are easily defined.\nFurthermore, there is also the possibility to import Konzertmeister appointments in a personal calendar and therefore also available outside the app at any time."

You can keep staying in the zone and running the timer.\n\n* Fractional time is allowed\nClassical Promodoro clock requires to maintain 25 minutes duration. Focus Tomato freely lets you count the fractional time as long as it starts running.\n\n* Modifiable Timeline\nIt is usual to forget to stop the timer. Focus Tomato allows you to modify the Timeline and make adjustments afterward.\n\n* Do Not Disturb mode is available\nDistracted by too many notifications? Do Not Disturb mode can be enabled when Focus Tomato is running.\n\n* Integrate smoothly with other work methods and/or apps\nBecause the app only applies the timing part of the Promodoro technique, in addition to the original Promodoro method, you can also use the Reminder, Trello, or physical notebooks along with it.\n\n\n\nGood tomato, why not eat it?"

      "label": "Padlet is a digital canvas to create beautiful projects that are easy to share and collaborate on.\n\nIt works like a piece of paper. We give you an empty page - a padlet - and you can put whatever you like on it. Drag in a video, record an interview, snap a selfie, write your own text posts or upload some documents, and voilà! A padlet is born. Make it even more beautiful by choosing custom wallpapers and themes.\n\nPadlet is different from other blogging tools and inspiration boards because it’s flexible. Create a grocery list, a Venn diagram, a discussion board, a group greeting card, a portfolio, or a business plan, all in one app. Used by teachers, students, professionals, and individuals of all ages, all around the world, padlets can be selectively shared and edited among multiple contributors.\n\nPadlet for iPhone takes the Padlet you know and love, and makes it portable. With views tailored for smaller devices and easy-to-use editor buttons, you can change how your padlet looks with a quick tap. Personalize it with selfies. Use our new menu to invite others to view and edit your padlets. Share across social platforms.\n\nClassKit integration makes it easier for teachers to share and track their students when working on padlets. Teachers can create handouts that include a padlet and then share the assignment to their respective classes. The students are then able to open the padlet from the SchoolWork app and start work on their assignments right away. Teachers will be able to see who has opened the assignment, how long they have worked on the assignment, and whether or not they have completed their work.\n\nMillions of people are already using Padlet for:\n\nPortfolios\nOpinion forums\nLesson plans\nBios\nReal estate listings\nTimelines\nBlogs\nQ+A\nTo-Do list\nInspiration board\nWriting prompts\nCollecting feedback\nCollaborative note-taking\nPhoto collages\nSolo or group presentations\nGroup greeting cards\nRSVPs\nPen Pal messages\nProfessional Development\n\nHere’s what happy users around the world have to say about Padlet:\n\n“Your app is fantastic. Congrats for being intuitive!”\n\n\"Padlet is the best god damn thing anyone has invented.\"\n\n\"Whether you're a newbie or  an EdTech whizz, Padlet is an app you absolutely have to use!\" - James Gibbons (@ThatEdTechGuy)\n\nEasy to use for both me and my students. Takes to minutes to make a customized feedback forum that is secure and interactive.\n\n\"The best tool I've used to create true interaction sharing and provide powerful choice and agency for students (and teachers).\"\n\nUPGRADE TO PRO WITHIN THE APP\n\nYou can upgrade to Padlet Pro for $99.99 a year or $12.99 a month. With Pro you get:\n\n- unlimited padlets\n- 10x bigger uploads\n- custom domains for your padlets\n- folders\n- priority support\n\nNote: payment will be charged to your iTunes account once you confirm the upgrade. Padlet Pro automatically renews unless it is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n\nTo turn off auto-renewal, go to Account > Billing > Manage in App Store.\n\nNo cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period.\n\nTERMS OF USE:\nhttps://legal.padlet.com/terms\n\nRead our privacy policy at https://legal.padlet.com/privacy.

They pick what time(s) work for them.\n \n \nTHE BEST FEATURES\n- Group polls: The fastest way to find the right time for a meeting without having access to people’s calendars.\n- 1:1s: Meet on your terms: select multiple times and let participants book what fits their schedule.\n- Booking pages: Let clients, co-workers, and more book time with you instantly. You define your availability.\n- No ads: Keep it professional for your participants with ad-free scheduling.\n- Custom branding: Delight your marketing team by putting your branding on every invite or booking page.\n-Deadlines and reminders: Get the most responses or make your invites time-limited.\n- Video conferencing links: Automatically add video conferencing to every booked remote meeting.\n \nHOW TO GET STARTED\n- Download the app and create an account. We’ll take you to our website to do this. You can also start a trial.\n- Take Doodle for a spin: Hit the create button (the + button) in the top right to create your first invite or booking page.\n- Add the times or availability and details. Create then send the link to your participants.\n- Is it a group poll? Make sure to close the poll after everyone has responded and we’ll email them all the details.\n- Automatic calendar syncing: Avoid double bookings and keep your invites and booking pages always current.\n \nLOVING THE APP?\nMake sure you leave a review.

      "label": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n \nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\nMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n \nGetting started with passwordless\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n \nGetting started with autofill\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n \nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\n \nOptional Access permissions:\nMicrosoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaq\nAccessibility Service:  Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.\nLocation: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.\nCamera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.\nRead the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.Some information from your storage is collected to diagnose the issue."

Backup and sync your pictures, videos, documents, and other files to cloud storage and access them from any device, anywhere. With advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share and send photos or files to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing.\n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account.\n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery.\n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data.

Share folders with your contacts and see their updates in real time.\n\nMEGA’s strong and secure end-to-end encryption means we cannot access or reset your password. You MUST remember your password and make sure to back up your account Recovery Key. Losing your password and the account Recovery Key will result in lost access to your files.\n\nUse the included MEGA Secure Chat for end-to-end-encrypted communications, including video and audio calls, with total privacy. Chat history synchronises automatically across multiple devices and you can also easily add files to, and from your MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\nMEGA offers a generous 20 GB free storage for all registered users as standard. You can get even more storage in 5 GB increments through the MEGA Achievements program as well.\n\nNeed more storage? Check out our affordable MEGA Pro subscription plans that offer plenty more space:\nPro Lite: €4.99 (US$4.99) per month or €49.99 (US$49.99) per year gives you 400 GB storage space and 1 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro I: €9.99 (US$9.99) per month or €99.99 (US$99.99) per year gives you 2 TB storage space and 2 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro II: €19.99 (US$19.99) per month or €199.99 (US$199.99) per year gives you 8 TB of storage space and 8 TB transfer quota per month.\nPro III: €29.99 (US$29.99) per month or €299.99 (US$299.99) per year gives you 16 TB storage space and 16 TB transfer quota per month.\n\nAll MEGA client-side application code is published on GitHub, for transparency. The code of our iOS mobile app is located at: https://github.com/meganz/ios\n\nSubscriptions renew automatically for successive periods of the same duration at the same price as the initial period chosen. You can cancel the automatic renewal of your MEGA Pro subscription no later than 24 hours before your next subscription payment is due, via your iTunes account settings page. To manage your subscriptions, tap on the App Store icon on your device, sign in with your Apple ID at the bottom of the page (if you haven’t already done so) and then tap View ID. You’ll be taken to your account page where you can scroll down to Manage App Subscriptions. From there, you can select your MEGA Pro subscription and view your scheduled renewal date, choose a different subscription package or toggle the on-off switch to off to disable the auto-renewal of your subscription.\n\nTerms of Service: https://mega.io/terms\nPrivacy Policy: https://mega.io/privacy"

The app notifies you within seconds about calls, voice messages, and other events. Enjoy mobile access to the photos, music and other data stored on your FRITZ!Box from anywhere. Use the app to conveniently control your call diversions, smart home plugs and thermostats, answering machines, and other home network devices connected with your FRITZ!Box. If you want to change any settings, simply use the app to open the user interface - from wherever you are.\n\nPrerequisite for using the MyFRITZ!App: FRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 6.50 or higher.\nPrerequisite for full scope of functions of the MyFRITZ!App: FRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 7.29 or higher.\n\nIf you also want to use all of the functions when you are on the go, the FRITZ!Box must be connected to the internet and have a public IPv4 address.\n\n \nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I log into a different FRITZ!Box?\n\nMyFRITZ!App can be used with several FRITZ!Box products. If you want to switch to a different FRITZ!Box, select the desired FRITZ!Box in the app settings (gear) or tap \"Add another FRITZ!Box\" to register the new FRITZ!Box. To register a new FRITZ!Box, you must be connected to that FRITZ!Box's wireless network.\n\nQuestion: Why can I no longer switch my wireless network and my guest network using the app?\n\nSeveral FRITZ!Boxes (for instance, the FRITZ!Box 7490) require FRITZ!OS 7.10, which is currently not available for all FRITZ!Boxes.\n\nQuestion: Why can't I access my FRITZ!Box when I am away from home?\n\nIf you want to change the settings, you must be connected to your FRITZ!Box's wireless network. Make sure that you enabled \"Enable use from on the go\" in the app's settings.\nIf you also want to access the FRITZ!Box user interface from on the go, a FRITZ!Box user who has been granted the right \"Access from the Internet allowed\" must be configured.\n\nSome internet service providers (including many cable providers) provide connections that do not allow you to access the home connection from the internet or certain restrictions apply because no public IPv4 address is provided. MyFRITZ!App normally recognizes that type of connection automatically and displays a corresponding message. These types of connections are called \"DS-Lite\", \"Dual-Stack-Lite\" or \"Carrier Grade NAT\" (CGN). You can ask your provider whether it would be possible to receive a public IPv4 address.\n\nQuestion: What can I do if there is no update to FRITZ!OS 6.50 or later for my FRITZ!Box?\n\nUnfortunately, in this case you cannot use the MyFRITZ!App.\n\nQuestion: If I have suggestions for improving the app or discover an error, how can I tell AVM?\n\nWe always welcome feedback! Open the app settings (gear) and tap \"Give Feedback\" to send us a brief message. A log is automatically attached to your message; this also helps us to analyze errors."

      "label": "FRITZ!App Smart Home: Clear, convenient, practical\n\nThe new FRITZ!App Smart Home is the convenient remote control for your FRITZ! Smart Home devices, at home or from on the go. All you need is a FRITZ!Box with FRITZOS 7.10 or higher.\n\nThe FRITZ!App Smart Home is your practical helper, with which you can control many Smart Home functions. You can, for instance:\n\n- use the FRITZ!DECT 200 smart plug to switch on the aquarium, heat up the coffee machine, or disconnect media players and TVs from power overnight.\n- use the outdoor FRITZ!DECT 210 smart plug to monitor the cost of charging the e-bike, or to switch on the atmospheric garden lighting.\n- use the FRITZ!DECT 301 radiator control to heat the living room to the temperature you like, and save money with automatic heating plans.\n- use the FRITZ!DECT 500 LED light to provide for a feel-good atmosphere in the evening, and stimulating lighting in the morning.\n\nIn the FRITZ!App Smart Home, the arrangement of the Smart Home devices can be tailored to your own personal wishes – simply place a finger on a tile until it is released, and then move it to the desired position.\n\nYour FRITZ! Smart Home can do even more. You can register new Smart Home devices with your FRITZ!Box by a simple press of the button. It is easy to configure heating plans, automatic switching, templates and groups in the user interface of your FRITZ!Box. The FRITZ!DECT 400 switches your floor lamp in the living room or your outside lighting via FRITZ!DECT 200 and 210. Our latest product is the FRITZ!DECT 440 switch with four buttons and a display. FRITZ!DECT 440 can dim your FRITZ!DECT 500 LED light, for instance, and measure the temperature for FRITZ!DECT 301.\n\nTip: Expand the possibilities in your FRITZ! Smart Home today with the upcoming FRITZ!OS for the FRITZ!Box. The software includes completely redesigned operation of the Smart Home in the FRITZ!Box user interface, new functions for the upcoming 4-button FRITZ!DECT 440 switch, and presents a whole range of colors in its support for the new FRITZ!DECT 500 LED light. The new FRITZ!OS is available for you to test in the FRITZ! Lab at en.avm.de/fritz-lab.\n\nPrerequisite\nFRITZ!Box with FRITZ!OS version 7.10 or higher\nIf the internet connection of your FRITZ!Box does not have a public IPv4 address, there may be some restrictions to use on the go in some mobile or Wi-Fi networks.\n\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n\nQuestion: How can I register with another FRITZ!Box?\n\nThe FRITZ!App Smart Home supports the operation on exactly one FRITZ!Box. If you want to change the FRITZ!Box, select \"New Login\" in the settings. To log on to the FRITZ!Box, you must be connected to the Wi-Fi of your FRITZ!Box.\n\nQuestion: Why can't I access my FRITZ!Box when I'm on the move?\n\nMake sure that you have activated \"Use on the move\" in the settings. To change the settings, you must be connected to the WLAN of your FRITZ! Box.\n\nSome Internet service providers (increasingly cable providers) provide connections where remote access from the Internet to the connection at home is not possible or only possible with restrictions because no public IPv4 address is provided. The FRITZ!App Smart Home usually detects such connections automatically and displays a corresponding message. Such connection types are called \"DS-Lite\", \"Dual-Stack-Lite\" or \"Carrier Grade NAT\" (CGN). If necessary, you can ask your provider whether there is an option to obtain a public IPv4 address."

We give you an empty page - a padlet - and you can put whatever you like on it. Drag in a video, record an interview, snap a selfie, write your own text posts or upload some documents, and voilà! A padlet is born. Make it even more beautiful by choosing custom wallpapers and themes.\n\nPadlet is different from other blogging tools and inspiration boards because it’s flexible. Create a grocery list, a Venn diagram, a discussion board, a group greeting card, a portfolio, or a business plan, all in one app. Used by teachers, students, professionals, and individuals of all ages, all around the world, padlets can be selectively shared and edited among multiple contributors.\n\nPadlet for iPhone takes the Padlet you know and love, and makes it portable. With views tailored for smaller devices and easy-to-use editor buttons, you can change how your padlet looks with a quick tap. Personalize it with selfies. Use our new menu to invite others to view and edit your padlets. Share across social platforms.\n\nClassKit integration makes it easier for teachers to share and track their students when working on padlets. Teachers can create handouts that include a padlet and then share the assignment to their respective classes. The students are then able to open the padlet from the SchoolWork app and start work on their assignments right away. Teachers will be able to see who has opened the assignment, how long they have worked on the assignment, and whether or not they have completed their work.\n\nMillions of people are already using Padlet for:\n\nPortfolios\nOpinion forums\nLesson plans\nBios\nReal estate listings\nTimelines\nBlogs\nQ+A\nTo-Do list\nInspiration board\nWriting prompts\nCollecting feedback\nCollaborative note-taking\nPhoto collages\nSolo or group presentations\nGroup greeting cards\nRSVPs\nPen Pal messages\nProfessional Development\n\nHere’s what happy users around the world have to say about Padlet:\n\n“Your app is fantastic. Congrats for being intuitive!”\n\n\"Padlet is the best god damn thing anyone has invented.\"\n\n\"Whether you're a newbie or  an EdTech whizz, Padlet is an app you absolutely have to use!\" - James Gibbons (@ThatEdTechGuy)\n\nEasy to use for both me and my students. Takes to minutes to make a customized feedback forum that is secure and interactive.\n\n\"The best tool I've used to create true interaction sharing and provide powerful choice and agency for students (and teachers).\"\n\nUPGRADE TO PRO WITHIN THE APP\n\nYou can upgrade to Padlet Pro for $99.99 a year or $12.99 a month. With Pro you get:\n\n- unlimited padlets\n- 10x bigger uploads\n- custom domains for your padlets\n- folders\n- priority support\n\nNote: payment will be charged to your iTunes account once you confirm the upgrade. Padlet Pro automatically renews unless it is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period.\n\n\nTo turn off auto-renewal, go to Account > Billing > Manage in App Store.\n\nNo cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period.\n\nTERMS OF USE:\nhttps://legal.padlet.com/terms\n\nRead our privacy policy at https://legal.padlet.com/privacy.

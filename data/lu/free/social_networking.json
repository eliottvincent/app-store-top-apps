      "label": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nApple Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

Decide whether your posts are shared with your followers, just the people you mention, or the whole world. Content warnings let you hide posts containing sensitive or triggering material until you're ready to engage with them. Each community has its own guidelines and moderators to keep its members safe, and robust blocking and reporting tools help prevent abuse.\n\nMore features:\n\n• Dark Mode: Read posts in light, dark, or true black mode\n• Polls: Ask followers for their opinion and tally the votes\n• Explore: Trending hashtags and accounts are a tap away\n• Notifications: Get notified about new follows, replies, and reblogs\n• Sharing: Post directly to Mastodon from any share sheet in any app\n• Cuteness: Our mascot is an adorable elephant, and you'll see them pop up from time to time\n\nMastodon is a registered nonprofit and development is supported directly by your donations.

To offer the widest range of features and up-to-date technology the app has been updated more than 60 times in the past 3 years and we will continue to do so.\n\nYou only need to scan a QR code and then you can:\n\n- access all of your WhatsApp chats (and group chats)\n- enjoy VOICE MESSAGES (SEND + RECEIVE)\n- reply to chats via KEYBOARD, QUICK REPLIES, DICTATION and SCRIBBLE\n- use a VARIETY of different KEYBOARD LAYOUTS*\n- watch VIDEOS\n- see STATUS UPDATES (TEXT, PICTURE, VIDEO)\n- view STICKERS and HD PICTURES (and ZOOM into them in native resolution)\n- CUSTOMIZE your quick replies\n- start a new chat right from the Watch\n- set each chat's font size\n- …\n\n... all with full respect to your privacy, WatchChat does not collect any personal data.\n\n*The currently supported keyboard layouts are:\n\n- FlickType (English)\n- ABC (English, Deutsch, Español, Português, אבגדה, Ελληνικά, Suomi, русский)\n- QWERTY (English, Español, Italiano)\n- QWERTZ (Deutsch)\n- AZERTY (Français)\n- אבגדה)עברית)\n\n\n\nSetting up the app for the first time only takes 4 simple steps:\n\n- open the app on your Apple Watch\n- open WhatsApp\n- in WhatsApp, go to (Settings) > (Linked Devices / WhatsApp Web) > (Link a device)\n- scan the QR code that will appear on your Apple Watch after 10-30 seconds\n- if a popup comes up, just try again, it will work out eventually :)\n\n\nAs this is a 3rd-party-app, I would really appreciate if you had suggestions for further development so I can take your ideas into consideration. If you encounter issues while using the app, don't hesitate to contact me, I am more than happy to help.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that, as the app isn’t officially affiliated with WhatsApp, available features and functionality are subject to change. To keep up with everything, the app has been updated more than 70 times since its release in 2017 - I am always looking for ways to offer new features or improve the existing ones.\n\n\nYou can use the app for free forever, but if you want to support the app's further development, the \"Support WatchChat Development\" subscription CAN be purchased for free users to access the \"Contacts\" and \"Status\" sections and will grant access to future additions. After the free trial period, if offered, the subscription automatically renews with the price and duration given in the purchase button unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. YOU CAN MANAGE AND CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS BY GOING TO YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE APP STORE AFTER PURCHASE. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\n\nAs of January, IF you want to sign up for the subscription, the free trial period is 3 days, it is billed annually and the price is about the equivalent of 3 USD.\n\n\nTerms of use: https://watchchat.info/terms.html"

      "label": "Geneva is a group communication app designed for organized, ongoing conversations with all your favorite people. Join or create a \"home\" for your group and set up a mix of chat, forum, audio, video, and broadcast rooms for different topics.\n\nWhether you're aimlessly hanging with best friends, keeping your club members on the same page, or sharing opinions with peers across the country — there’s a place for everyone here.\n\n\nHere are a few of the highlights:\n\nHOMES & ROOMS\nSet up \"homes\" for your groups, then create \"rooms\" inside them for different topics or sub-groups. Rooms can be open or secret, and because everyone can adjust their notification settings for each one, people can tune into the conversations they care about and tune out the rest. There are 5 different kinds of rooms you can use...\n\nCHAT ROOMS\nFull-featured chat rooms with @ mentions, threaded replies, emoji reactions, GIFs, attachments, polls, events, pins, typing indicators, and more...\n\nFORUM ROOMS\nThese post-style rooms are more organized than chat rooms, making them great for announcements and deeper discussion. Create long-form posts with rich formatting, comment and react, and sort and filter the room by most recent, most popular, and more...\n\nAUDIO ROOMS\nIf you'd rather talk than type and read, you can create an audio room in your home and jump in with a tap whenever the mood strikes. Think of it like a big group phone call, but way easier.\n\nVIDEO ROOMS\nHop in a video room and hang out with up to 16 people at once. With screensharing built in, these are great for small events and more casual get-togethers.\n\nBROADCAST ROOMS\nGo live on video with up to 9 people on stage and thousands of viewers to call on-air. Use these for things like chapter meetings, casual panels, DIY tutorials, live-reacts, and more...\n\nDMs\nBecause sometimes you just want to start a private side convo.\n\nEVENTS CALENDAR\nWith event invites and a centralized calendar, it's easy to share info, gather RSVPs, and get reminders to hop on. Events can take place right in your Geneva home, IRL, or anywhere else online.\n\nGATES\nUse gates to control access to your Geneva home. Our built-in new member questionnaire helps you gather info about potential members and decide if they're a good fit — no need to use a separate survey tool. Age, nickname, entry fee, and more gates coming soon.\n\nROLES & PERMISSIONS\nSet up roles to control who can and can't do things like invite other people, create rooms, moderate messages, and more...\n\nNO ADS & NO SELLING YOUR DATA\nEver. Instead, we're building a bunch of exciting features that'll make it really easy for people on Geneva to transact with one another, and when that happens, we'll keep 5% (more info on this coming soon).\n\nACTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY\nBecause everyone signs up with a phone number, not an email address, blocks and bans are easier to enforce so there’s less room for trolling and abuse (but don't worry, we won't share or display your phone number anywhere). We also give you the ability to set your home's rules and tools to help you enforce them.\n\nDESIGNED FOR EVERYONE\nGeneva is great for all kinds of social groups: friends & families, school clubs, sports teams, movements, fraternities and sororities, creators & fans, coaches & students, professional networks, brand communities, interest groups, and more...\n\n\nAnd this is just the beginning:\n\nWe're working together to build something that's fun, safe and useful, and we'll be adding new features all the time. If you have suggestions, questions, or feedback, drop us a note at hi@geneva.com.\n\n\nMade with love in New York City and beyond."

      "label": "T.Flex is an all-in-one mission critical communications powerhouse that connects people in a variety of ways in a wide range of situations. Its capabilities comprise voice and video calls, messaging, tracking (including indoor localization), task management and more. The uses of the app are versatile. For some users, it helps ensure smooth operation of their business. For others, it's part of the security toolset. Importantly, it can be vital in responding to dangerous incidents where lives depend on timely communication. Whether you're a logistics specialist, a guard on patrol, a firefighter or a police officer, you will appreciate the reliable power of T.Flex, its focus and ease of use.\n\nThis app is the client-side component of the TASSTA framework. TASSTA provides mission critical push-to-talk (MC-PTT) capabilities in LTE networks over the Internet Protocol (IP) and builds a comprehensive communications and emergency response solution on that foundation. The following are some highlights of the TASSTA features that T.Flex implements.\n\nVoice communication features\n\nCall capabilities are at the heart of mission-critical communications. In addition to the obligatory group and individual calls, T.Flex offers an extended set of voice and video call types.\n\n• Individual, group and channel calls\n• Emergency calls\n• Priority calls\n• Video calls\n• Offline user calls\n• Voice recording and playback\n\nMessaging features\n\nIn situations where voice communication is not your first choice of format, use free-form or template-based text messages, or send arbitrary files over your TASSTA network.\n\n• Text and file exchange\n• Template-based status messages\n\nLone worker protection features\n\nIntended for ensuring the safety of employees who are working in hazardous conditions, these features rely on sensor and battery charge data. These readings can indicate emergencies and cause alerts to be triggered.\n\n• Sensor state tracking\n• Automated alerts (such as Man Down) based on sensor data analysis\n• Battery charge monitoring\n\nLocation and tracking features\n\nAlways-on location tracking is a core component of T.Flex operation and in many cases the reason to use the app. Access to location is required by dispatchers for ensuring personnel safety and tracking assets.\n\n• Subscriber identification and location markers\n• Detailed street view\n• Guard tour planning\n• Waypoints\n• Indoor localization\n\nOther features\n\n• Remote listening and camera\n• Task management and control\n\nNote that the feature set for your particular T.Flex setup will be as broad or as lean as your TASSTA administrators configure it to be."

      "label": "Tumblr. Pure effervescent enrichment. Old internet energy. Home of the Reblogs. All the art you never knew you needed. All the fandoms you could wish for. Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up. \n\nOh, and influencers? Don’t even go here. Every video you find, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate, every waterfall GIF you secretly gaze at in wonder—that’s all you. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Welcome to weird. Make it yours. \n\nNow picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is. \n\n-\n\nChances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. Tumblr is the home of all things weird and wonderful, funny and fascinating—old-school internet vibes. We’re built a little different, just like everyone else who goes here.\n\nYour dashboard will become the place to see what you want to see: a chronological tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, reblog and add your own take, this is your universe to discover, express, and enjoy. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here.\n\nWhen you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world, F1 fanfic that your mutuals need to see—you have so many options. Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. You can make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes. Don’t say we don’t spoil you!\n\nThe reblog starts conversations in which anyone can join. Reblogging creates jokes and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post only for a couple of your friends to engage with? All possible here). No matter who you are, where you are, or what you are (looking at you here, Pikaman), this is your space—with as much freedom or privacy as you need. \n\nTumblr is the home of fandom. Maybe you have a favorite blorbo from your show? There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3, *and* see their OC art on Tumblr, *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? You get the idea: it’s all here. Wait. Frogs. Did we mention the frogs? \n\nIt’s a whole world out here. If the prospect of reblogging, shipping, curating, and fanart feels a little daunting, or you simply require a refresher on how all this works, head over to tips.tumblr.com, where Cat Frazier of animatedtext.tumblr.com will take you through the finer points of Tumblr etiquette—the effervescent, the eeby, the deeby.\n\nSo. Sign up, follow some tags, and find your place on the dashboard. Then reblog, like, and post to your heart’s content. Or simply drift through the dream you’ve created for yourself—a chronological dashboard curated by you. For you. You hold the keys to this kingdom.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tumblr/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tumblr/\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.tumblr.com/policy/terms-of-service"

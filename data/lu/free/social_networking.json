It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.\n\nApple Terms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/"

To offer the widest range of features and up-to-date technology the app has been updated more than 60 times in the past 3 years and we will continue to do so.\n\nYou only need to scan a QR code and then you can:\n\n- access all of your WhatsApp chats (and group chats)\n- enjoy VOICE MESSAGES (SEND + RECEIVE)\n- reply to chats via KEYBOARD, QUICK REPLIES, DICTATION and SCRIBBLE\n- use a VARIETY of different KEYBOARD LAYOUTS*\n- watch VIDEOS\n- see STATUS UPDATES (TEXT, PICTURE, VIDEO)\n- view STICKERS and HD PICTURES (and ZOOM into them in native resolution)\n- CUSTOMIZE your quick replies\n- start a new chat right from the Watch\n- set each chat's font size\n- …\n\n... all with full respect to your privacy, WatchChat does not collect any personal data.\n\n*The currently supported keyboard layouts are:\n\n- FlickType (English)\n- ABC (English, Deutsch, Español, Português, אבגדה, Ελληνικά, Suomi, русский)\n- QWERTY (English, Español, Italiano)\n- QWERTZ (Deutsch)\n- AZERTY (Français)\n- אבגדה)עברית)\n\n\n\nSetting up the app for the first time only takes 4 simple steps:\n\n- open the app on your Apple Watch\n- open WhatsApp\n- in WhatsApp, go to (Settings) > (Linked Devices / WhatsApp Web) > (Link a device)\n- scan the QR code that will appear on your Apple Watch after 10-30 seconds\n- if a popup comes up, just try again, it will work out eventually :)\n\n\nAs this is a 3rd-party-app, I would really appreciate if you had suggestions for further development so I can take your ideas into consideration. If you encounter issues while using the app, don't hesitate to contact me, I am more than happy to help.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that, as the app isn’t officially affiliated with WhatsApp, available features and functionality are subject to change. To keep up with everything, the app has been updated more than 70 times since its release in 2017 - I am always looking for ways to offer new features or improve the existing ones.\n\n\nYou can use the app for free forever, but if you want to support the app's further development, the \"Support WatchChat Development\" subscription CAN be purchased for free users to access the \"Contacts\" and \"Status\" sections and will grant access to future additions. After the free trial period, if offered, the subscription automatically renews with the price and duration given in the purchase button unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. YOU CAN MANAGE AND CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS BY GOING TO YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS ON THE APP STORE AFTER PURCHASE. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\n\nAs of January, IF you want to sign up for the subscription, the free trial period is 3 days, it is billed annually and the price is about the equivalent of 3 USD.\n\n\nTerms of use: https://watchchat.info/terms.html"

      "label": "Du bekommst mehr Pakete geliefert als du selber verschickst?  \nMit repacket landet brauchbares Verpackungsmaterial nicht mehr im Müll.  \n\nAuf der Karte siehst du Händler, die sich über deine gebrauchten, aber gut erhaltenen Pakete, Versandtaschen und Füllmaterial freuen und sie wiederverwenden würden. Anstatt die Sachen in die überquellende Mülltonne zu werfen, schaue auf der Karte nach einem Händler in deiner Nachbarschaft und bringe ihm den Karton vorbei, wenn du das nächste Mal das Haus verlässt. Als Paket-Spender musst du dich weder registrieren, noch sonstige Daten von dir preisgeben.  \n \nFür Händler, die Second-Hand-Kartons verwenden möchten, gab es bisher zu wenig Kontaktmöglichkeit mit Leuten, die Verpackungsmaterial spenden würden.  \nNun können sie sich auf der Karte registrieren und durch vier Kategorien festlegen, was im Geschäft aktuell wiederverwendet werden kann: Große Pakete, kleine Pakete, Versandtaschen und/oder Füllmaterial.  \nNeben der Geldersparnis durch die Wiederverwendung wird so sicher der ein oder andere Spender auf Produkte im Laden aufmerksam, die er sonst online gekauft hätte. So hilft repacket zusätzlich den lokalen Einzelhandel zu stärken.  \n \nEin alltagstauglicher Weg, um nachhaltiger mit Ressourcen umzugehen: Obwohl Kartons zum Großteil aus Recyclingpapier bestehen und auch selber oft recycelt werden, lohnt es sich energietechnisch enorm einen Karton wiederzuverwenden, bevor er recycelt wird.  \nWirft man einen Karton in die Papiertonne, werden die Fasern in Deutschland im Normalfall recycelt. Papierfasern können aber durchschnittlich nur bis zu sieben Mal recycelt werden.  \nDa man aber einen Karton durchschnittlich drei bis vier Mal wiederverwenden könnte, ohne dass das Material seine schützenden Eigenschaften verliert, wäre es möglich mit einem Paket 21 Mal Ware zu verschicken. Man könnte also insgesamt zwei Drittel der Gesamtenergie, welche für den Recyclingprozess aufgewendet werden würde, einsparen. \n \nDie App ist kostenlos."

      "label": "The ONLY app w/ real-world generated hashtags and analysis.\n*NEW* Custom fonts enabled in themes.\n*NEW* Hashtag tracking and tailored notifications.\n\nThings on Instagram evolve pretty quickly, but one thing that hasn’t changed is the importance of hashtags.\nTo this day, building an effective hashtag strategy is one of the best ways to get your posts discovered by new and relevant audiences.  Depending on how relevant your hashtags are, this can mean more engagement, more followers, and if you're a business, it even can lead to more customers! \n\nAll tags are NOT created equally. \n\nHashtags by StatStory uses a unique hashtag search algorithm that works in any language to make sure you are always given the most up to date hashtags for your posts on Instagram.  We don't use out of date hashtags lists like all the other guys.  Every time you search a hashtag we find relevant tags people are using in real time! Remember, a tag that was once popular, might not be popular now. \n\nSimply enter a relevant hashtag or a word that describes the post, and we will return a custom-tailored list of hashtags based on the most popular posts that are similar to yours! Feel free to use obscure or specific terms, in ANY language. The app will show you the popularity of that tag and how many posts use it. Use a mix of popular and less popular tags to broaden your reach. You can tap and remove any tags you don't want.\n\nUse Themes and hashtag Layouts to take your Instagram game to the next level.  Put together greetings, signature lines, and separators to make your post stand out!  You can even add your custom tag lines, and lists.  Go crazy and experiment.  \n\nYou can also use our pre-made lists that are automatically updated regularly.\n\nWe have 100+ lists for:\n- Fashion\n- Motivation\n- Travel\n- Sports\n- Animals\n- Health & Fitness\n- Food & Drink\n- Seasons\n- Electronics\n- Art \n- & so much more!\n\nWorried about your post getting ghost banned because of bad tags?  Unlike other apps, when you use Hashtags by StatStory you never have to worry about getting blocked or restricted tags that can harm your account.\n\nInstagram only allows 30 hashtags per photo. Our app counts your tags, including your personal tags, to make sure you do not go over.\n\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\nHashtags by StatStory offers an auto-renewing monthly and yearly subscription at $8.99/month and $53.99/year respectively to provide you with unlimited queries and favorites while you maintain an active subscription.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your iTunes Account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current subscription period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and the cost of the renewal will be identified. You may manage your subscription and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to your Account Settings after the purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription, where applicable.\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: http://wickeyware.com/terms-conditions-terms/\nPrivacy policy: http://wickeyware.com/privacy-policy/"

Spotted connects you with singles around you and is intended to bring you a second chance.\n \nAfter you install the dating-app on your smartphones and allow tracking via GPS, they will be regularly located.

On Livestatus, you can send all types of messages, including texts, photos, emoji status and your drawings straight to your friends’ lock and Home Screen. When your friends see your updates on screens, they can open the widget and send their messages back to your lock& phone screens. Livestatus offers an intimate and innovative way for friends to chat and stay connected with each other.\n\n- Send messages to friends’ lock & Home Screens\nLivestatus is the first app that allows you to ‘pin’ your messages on your friends’ lock & Home Screen via widget. Everything you send in chat, including  texts, photos, emoji status and your doodles, will automatically go to your friends’ lock & Home Screen. Pin your messages so your friends' will never miss them.\n\n- Reply friends’ moments in Picture-in-Picture format!\nResponding to your friends’ moments has never been easier! when you receive a photo from your friends on Home Screen, you can tap the widget and snap a photo to send back to them. You and your friends’ photo will be in the same frame in the picture-in-picture (PIP) format. \n\n- Hundreds of status to spark conversations\nOn Livestatus, you can add an emoji status on your photo. The status shows on friends' Lock Screen while the photo goes to Home Screen. We have a big collection of 100+ emoji status . It’s ok if you don’t know which status to choose, lively can random a status and it will be fun to see how your friends react :)\n\n- Vanish mode available!\nLivestatus added the vanish mode for sharing photos! when you send a photo to your friends, they only have one chance to view it. Once it's viewed, the photo will vanish both from your widget and chat. In this new mode, you can safely send private or timely photos to your friends without worrying about leaving evidence. Even screenshots won't work in vanish mode! \n\nLivestatus is the best way for you and your friends to stay connected, and it will for sure transform the  way you share your life moments.

Then welcome on Feels, the feel good dating app designed for you to get tons of good vibes!\r\n\r\nMeeting your next crush, a lover or your new friends should not happen through swiping boring profile pics, that forces to judge each other based on appearance alone.

Find and and follow fascinating folks and read their posts in an ad-free, chronological timeline. Express yourself with custom emoji, images, GIFs, videos, and audio in 500-character posts. Reply to threads and reblog posts from anyone to share great stuff. Find new accounts to follow and trending hashtags to expand your network.\n\nMastodon is built with a focus on privacy and safety. Decide whether your posts are shared with your followers, just the people you mention, or the whole world. Content warnings let you hide posts containing sensitive or triggering material until you're ready to engage with them. Each community has its own guidelines and moderators to keep its members safe, and robust blocking and reporting tools help prevent abuse.\n\nMore features:\n\n• Dark Mode: Read posts in light, dark, or true black mode\n• Polls: Ask followers for their opinion and tally the votes\n• Explore: Trending hashtags and accounts are a tap away\n• Notifications: Get notified about new follows, replies, and reblogs\n• Sharing: Post directly to Mastodon from any share sheet in any app\n• Cuteness: Our mascot is an adorable elephant, and you'll see them pop up from time to time\n\nMastodon is a registered nonprofit and development is supported directly by your donations.

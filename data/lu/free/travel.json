Your own two feet, bicycles, buses, trains, the tram and your own car all have a place in the app, which now shows you even smarter routes! Discover the interplay of different modes of transport and create your own personal mobility chain within the app! The “My Mix” tab shows multi-mobile routes that make sense for your needs and preferences.\n\nThe power of the new mobiliteit.lu tool resides in its cooperation with third party mobility services. The planner suggests smart ways to reach your destination thanks to real-time information about the availability of vel’OH! and Vël’Ok bike sharing services, as well as of free spaces at Chargy points for electric cars. It even gives you an availability estimate for these services for a future date! For your travels by car, the planner even notifies you of possible disruptions on the roads in Luxembourg as well as in the Greater Region and shows you Park + Ride offers!"

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others.

      "label": "The MVV-App is a journey planning application created by the Munich transport association (Münchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund, MVV). It is both free of charge and without advertising.\n\nIt provides travel information for the entire public transport network in Munich and the surrounding regions (districts of Dachau, Ebersberg, Erding, Freising, Fürstenfeldbruck, München, Starnberg and the norhern part of Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen) – no matter whether you go by train, (sub)urban railways, underground, tram or bus. In many cases with real-time information. With the MVV-App you can also purchase selected MVV tickets with your smartphone or tablet on the go. Register once and you have the option to either buy the single trip tickets or you can choose to buy one of our day tickets for your stay in Munich. Besides, the MVV-App provides additional information on public transport in the entire Greater Munich Area, such as public transport and tariff maps as well as any changes in the timetables.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Departures:\nThe departure monitor indicates the next departures and/or arrivals from a stop or the stops in the neighborhood of your current location in real-time (where available).\n\n• Trips:\nThe journey planner will help you to find the quickest route from A to B – in many cases with real-time information. Just enter the name of a stop, a point of interest or any desired address in Munich or the surrounding districts as your starting point or destination. With GPS you can also use your current location. The results include all footpath directions. Save and label your favorite trips, get further information about your journey, share your trips or enter them into your calendar to be notified in time. The MVV-App also helps you buy the correct ticket for the selected journey. With just a few clicks you can purchase mobile tickets directly from the journey planner.\n\n• Disruptions:\nAt a glance, you can see disruptions that might affect your daily commute ordered by lines and their operation names. As yet, the descriptions of timetable changes are only available in German.\n\n• Tickets:\nWith menu item “Tickets” you can purchase selected MVV tickets as mobile ticket. Register once within one of the listed shops (identical range of tickets) and choose your ticket before starting your journey. You can pay for your tickets by using a credit card or direct debit. As electronic tickets are personalized, you have to bring your official photo ID.\n\n• Network plans:\nIn addition, the MVV-App provides you with various public transport network plans and tariff maps. Although most of the plans are in German language, you can find several plans in English, too. For example: the general plan of the regional train, suburban train and underground in the entire MVV area.\n\n• Interactive map:\nThe interactive map does not just help you to come along in the MVV area. You get access to further information such as nearby departures by using your GPS signal.\n\n• Settings:\nIf you choose the appropriate settings, you can for example avoid stairs during your trip or prefer less walking time over the quickest connection. In case you take a bike with you, the journey planner is able to take this into account too. You can also exclude connections not being integrated within the MVV tariff."

      "label": "The STIB-MIVB App is your partner for all your journeys through Brussels! Enjoy a personalised experience to plan your journeys through Brussels and beyond, by including STIB-MIVB and the other transport operators in Brussels.  \n\nTo do so, create your account, which will allow you to access a variety of functionalities. You already have a STIB-MIVB account on MyBOOTIK (the online service to purchase transport tickets)? Great! Just use your MyBOOTIK user ID to log on!  \n\nThe itinerary search of the STIB-MIVB App is the best door-to-door solution. Thanks to the positioning system, that includes a transport mode optimisation (on foot, bus, tram, metro or even train), you can get effortlessly from your departure point to your final destination. Launch an itinerary search and follow the instructions. Once you are in your transport mode (bus, tram, metro), the app will warn you to alight when you arrive near your destination. When you finished your itinerary, your journey will be added to your frequently used lines. Moreover, you can find your recent itinerary searches.  \n\nYou wish to think ahead and organise a journey in advance? No problem! Simply register your request and the app will warn you when it's time to go!  \n\nThe disruptions on your frequently used lines and the lines near your position are always available. With one click you can see the waiting time in real time at the stops nearby or the timetables of a line. You can save your favourite destinations and rename them. Thanks to this functionality, you can immediately launch your itinerary until one of your favourite destinations. What's more, you can save a stop or line in your favourites so as to immediately consult the waiting time at the stop and the possible disruptions associated or the detail of the line. \n\nWhen consulting a line, the information regarding lines parallel to this line is easily accessible. It will allow you to manage your journey and to optimise it by taking the first line servicing your stop.\n\nSee our Accessibility compliance statement: https://www.stib-mivb.be/article.html?l=en&_guid=d0f0d466-1483-3410-45af-9748427ab131#contentBodyList6"

Want to have quicker access to your ticket during ticket inspection? Want to be able to find your way better at the station and have reliable map information? We have good news for you! SBB Mobile can do it all. And much more. \n \nThe heart of the app is the new navigation bar with the following menu points and content.  \n\nPlan  \n• Plan your journey with a simple timetable search via the touch timetable or use your current position as the origin or destination, locating it on the map.  \n• Buy your ticket for the whole of Switzerland in just two clicks. Your travelcards on the SwissPass are applied. \n• Travel particularly affordably with supersaver tickets or Saver Day Passes. \n\nTrips \n• Save your trip and we will provide you with all the information you need during your journey under ‘Single Trips’: everything from departure and arrival times, platform information and service disruptions to train formations and walking routes.  \n• Set up your personal commuter route under ‘Commuting’ and receive push notifications about rail service disruptions. \n• The app accompanies you from door to door as you travel and you will receive information about delays, disruption and interchange times via push notification.  \n\nEasyRide \n• Check in, hop on and head off – across the entire GA Travelcard network. \n• EasyRide calculates the right ticket for your journey on the basis of the routes you travelled and charges you the relevant amount subsequently. \n \nTickets & Travelcards  \n• Show your public transport travelcards digitally with SwissPass Mobile. \n• It also gives you an overview of your valid and expired tickets and travelcards on the SwissPass. \n\nShop & Services  \n• Buy regional transport tickets and Day Passes for the GA Travelcard area of validity quickly and easily without searching the timetable.  \n• In the ‘Services’ section, you can find lots of useful links about travel. \n\nProfile  \n•  Straightforward access to your personal settings and our customer support.  \n\nContact us. \nIf you have any questions, feel free to get in touch: \n \nhttps://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile/contact.html \n \nData security and authorisations. \nWhat permissions does SBB Mobile need and why? \n \nLocation \nFor connections from your current location, the GPS function must be activated so that SBB Mobile can find the nearest stop. This also applies if you want to have the nearest stop displayed in the timetable. \n \nCalendar and e-mail \nYou can save connections in your own calendar and send them by e-mail (to friends, an external calendar). SBB Mobile requires read and write permissions to be able to import your desired connection into the calendar. \n \nAccess to the camera \nSBB Mobile requires access to your camera to take pictures directly in the app for your personalised touch timetable.  \n\nInternet access \nSBB Mobile requires internet access to search the timetable as well as for ticket purchases. \n \nMemory \nTo support offline functions, e.g. station/stop list, connections (history) and purchased tickets, SBB Mobile requires access to your device’s memory (saving app-specific settings)."

      "label": "Thousands of cars at your fingertips. With SHARE NOW, you'll always have a car in your city. Just like with car2go and DriveNow, our premium cars free-float around major city centres, making it easy for you to hop into the first one that catches your eye. Car-sharing is a new way of car rental, with no rental offices, no paperwork and no waiting around. Parking and fuelling/charging are free. All the perks of owning your own car – no strings attached. Rent a car the easy way. That's the SHARE NOW car-sharing app.\n\nWith SHARE NOW car-sharing, there are no annual or monthly fees for members. You can do everything you need to rent a car digitally via this smartphone app, including registration, unlocking and locking cars, payment and even the validation of your driver’s licence. That’s why we believe car-sharing is the future of urban mobility.\n\nSHARE NOW car-sharing is perfect for...\n\n• SPONTANEOUS TRIPS\nThis is car-sharing as you know it best: super short spontaneous trips for shopping, commuting and getting from A to B in your city. Find, reserve, and unlock SHARE NOW cars in less than two seconds. When you're done, simply park the car anywhere in the Home Area of your city. It’s as simple as that.\n\n• WEEKEND ROAD TRIPS\nGot plans? You can rent our free-floating cars at hourly rates. We also do medium-length road trips from just a single day to a whole weekend - get out into nature or visit your favourite shopping outlet. You’re in charge.\n\n• WEEK-LONG CAR RENTAL\nCar-sharing is also ideal for longer trips of up to 30 days for holiday travel. You can keep a car for yourself for longer (you pay per km) and take the stress of out renting a car. Roam freely outside of the Home Area and adventure beyond the city limits. We also offer pre-booking for longer trips. Tell us when and where you want your car – and we'll take care of the rest.\n\n• AIRPORT ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE\nWhether you’re catching a flight or have just landed, our cars are available at several major airports in Europe's top destinations, with dedicated parking at many locations. Car-sharing is cheaper than taxis and you never have to wait in line - just open the SHARE NOW app and reserve a car in a few taps. That’s one less thing to worry about.\n\n• BUSINESS TRIPS\nCar-sharing offers you a comfortable and cost-effective way to travel for business – with premium cars and convenient corporate invoicing. Manage all your colleagues' travel expenses in one easy admin dashboard. This is corporate car rental like never before.\n\n• CORPORATE PERKS\nCar-sharing is an affordable corporate mobility perk for your company. Offer your teams access to car-sharing and provide a comfortable way for your employees to travel for business. SHARE NOW Mobility Allowance lets you award car-sharing credit to individual employees via a single corporate account.\n\n• EARN REWARDS\nEarn points just by driving with SHARE NOW Rewards. As you level up, you’ll unlock perks and partner deals such as Bonus Reservation Time and Hourly Rates, VIP Customer Support, a Birthday Voucher and Overnight Reservation. We’ve partnered with like-minded companies to bring you special offers from those who care as much as we do about sharing. SHARE NOW Rewards is completely free to join.\n\n• INVITE FRIENDS\nInvite friends by sending them a personal code via messenger apps, such as WhatsApp, or via email or SMS. If they sign up using your promo code, you'll each earn free driving credits - it’s a win-win!\n\n\nEnjoy the largest electric car-sharing fleet in Europe with SHARE NOW. Our mission: to grow our electric fleet every year. Join the mobility movement now.\n\n\nDISCOVER CAR-SHARING IN YOUR CITY NOW:\nSHARE NOW is available in 16 major cities in 8 countries in Europe including Amsterdam, Berlin, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart,  Madrid, Milan, Rome, Turin, Paris, Vienna, Budapest and Copenhagen."

This service needs access to your adresses, so SCOTTY mobil asks you for access to your contacts the first time you activate it. This is the only SCOTTY-service that accesses contact information. No personal data is used, only adress data.\n\nInformation in real-time\nWherever you are, now you can get all the most up-to-date travel information directly on your iPhone. It doesn't matter whether you're on board of a train or if you're picking somebody up at the station - with SCOTTY mobil you know if your train is on schedule. If you like, you can also get the Timeboard, the departure monitor of your stop / station, directly on the screen of your iPhone.\n\nMost up to date disruption information\nA storm paralyzes half of Austria? A route is completely blocked? A rail replacement bus service will be in place? Always something unexpected may happen, that's life! But from now on you're always informed. You will get all information about delays or disruptions in the ÖBB railway network directly within SCOTTY mobil. This way you always stay connected.\n\nÖBB train radar\nThe train radar shows all ÖBB-trains running in the Austrian railway network on a map. Not only do you see all long distance trains but also regional trains. By clicking on a train you get information on its real time data – location and punctuality – and ist next stops. The viewing of trains can be limited to train types – for instance railjet or suburban trains – or to certain trains.\n\n\nThere's more to it than that…\n… more you will find at\nwww.oebb.at/scottymobil\n\nEnjoy your journey and have fun with SCOTTY mobil, your\nÖBB-Personenverkehr AG"

Your own two feet, bicycles, buses, trains, the tram and your own car all have a place in the app, which now shows you even smarter routes! Discover the interplay of different modes of transport and create your own personal mobility chain within the app! The “My Mix” tab shows multi-mobile routes that make sense for your needs and preferences.\n\nThe power of the new mobiliteit.lu tool resides in its cooperation with third party mobility services. The planner suggests smart ways to reach your destination thanks to real-time information about the availability of vel’OH! and Vël’Ok bike sharing services, as well as of free spaces at Chargy points for electric cars. It even gives you an availability estimate for these services for a future date! For your travels by car, the planner even notifies you of possible disruptions on the roads in Luxembourg as well as in the Greater Region and shows you Park + Ride offers!"

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

      "label": "Intuitive and simple, Visorando turns your mobile phone into a walking GPS ! With the app, you can :\n\nFIND ROUTES IDEAS\nYou will find varied and quality walking routes throughout the UK and around the world. The quality of the routes we suggest is our main concern. This is why each track is checked by a team of moderators before being published and shared with the community.\n\nKNOW YOUR POSITION\nIn real time, you can consult your position on the map layer you have chosen. This will allow you to better locate yourself and also visualise the points of interest around you.\n\nBE GUIDED\nOnce the walk has been selected and your preferred map layer is chosen, the app will safely guide you on the right route with detailed and verified directions. Even offline, the app will be able to guide you !\n\nRECORD YOUR TRACKS\nAt the same time as following the guidance, you have the possibility to record your own track. In this way, you can then analyse it, compare it, share it or simply redo it later.\n\nSHARE\nSince Visorando is built on a participatory model, we hope you’re going to share your routes with the community too ! GPX export is also possible for those who want to use their tracks on other types of devices.\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN TRACK\nDoes no walking idea fit your desires ? You can create your own route using our FREE walking planner available on the website via PC (and also on mobile if you subscribe to Club Visorando). Once your track is saved to your account, an automatic synchronisation takes place and you can immediately find your route in the app.\n\n__________\n\nPAID VERSION\nAccess to a wide range of licensed maps such as OS Explorer, IGN, Swisstopo, etc. for free for 3 days following your first log in to the app. After that, you should subscribe to the Club Visorando to keep access to them. Quarterly subscription costs £4,99 and annual subscription costs £21,49. \n\nThe subscription will automatically renew unless automatic renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be billed within 24 hours of the end of the current period, for an amount of £21,49 for an annual subscription to the Club Visorando or £4,99 for a quarterly subscription.\n\nThe OpenStreetMap map layer remains completely free. You can therefore continue to use the application for free with this map layer, even if you have passed the trial period for OS Explorer maps.\n\nPurchases are made on iTunes. You will therefore be billed to your iTunes account upon confirmation of your purchase.\nThe subscription will automatically renew unless automatic renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be billed within 24 hours of the end of the current period, for an amount of 21.49£ for an annual Club subscription or 4.99£ for a monthly Club subscription.\nSubscriptions can be managed through iTunes account settings after purchase.\n\nThe OpenStreetMap map layer remains completely free. You can therefore continue to use the application for free with this map layer, even if you have passed the trial period for OS Explorer and IGN maps.\n\n———\n\nTerms and Conditions and Privacy Policy: https://www.visorando.co.uk/privacy-policy.html"

Die Kreuzfahrtmarke steht für einen zeitgemäßen Urlaub auf dem Meer und richtet sich an den deutschsprachigen Markt. Das Unternehmen ist ein Joint Venture der TUI AG aus Hannover und Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., der zweitgrößten Kreuzfahrtgesellschaft der Welt mit Sitz in Miami.\nDas Unternehmen, das Kreuzfahrtreederei und Reiseveranstalter unter einem Dach vereint, hat seinen Firmensitz in der kreuzfahrtbegeisterten Stadt Hamburg.\nMit Wachstumsraten von mehr als zehn Prozent jährlich sind Kreuzfahrten der am stärksten wachsende Markt innerhalb des Premiumsegments der touristischen Angebote. Konsequent, dass TUI Cruises nicht die zum Neubau eines Schiffes notwendigen drei Jahre bis zum Eintritt in den Markt warten wollte, sondern ein Kreuzfahrtschiff kaufte und dem Konzept entsprechend umfassend neugestaltete."

Discover the interplay of different modes of transport and create your own personal mobility chain within the app! The “My Mix” tab shows multi-mobile routes that make sense for your needs and preferences.\n\nThe power of the new mobiliteit.lu tool resides in its cooperation with third party mobility services. The planner suggests smart ways to reach your destination thanks to real-time information about the availability of vel’OH! and Vël’Ok bike sharing services, as well as of free spaces at Chargy points for electric cars. It even gives you an availability estimate for these services for a future date! For your travels by car, the planner even notifies you of possible disruptions on the roads in Luxembourg as well as in the Greater Region and shows you Park + Ride offers!"

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

      "label": "Intuitive and simple, Visorando turns your mobile phone into a walking GPS ! With the app, you can :\n\nFIND ROUTES IDEAS\nYou will find varied and quality walking routes throughout the UK and around the world. The quality of the routes we suggest is our main concern. This is why each track is checked by a team of moderators before being published and shared with the community.\n\nKNOW YOUR POSITION\nIn real time, you can consult your position on the map layer you have chosen. This will allow you to better locate yourself and also visualise the points of interest around you.\n\nBE GUIDED\nOnce the walk has been selected and your preferred map layer is chosen, the app will safely guide you on the right route with detailed and verified directions. Even offline, the app will be able to guide you !\n\nRECORD YOUR TRACKS\nAt the same time as following the guidance, you have the possibility to record your own track. In this way, you can then analyse it, compare it, share it or simply redo it later.\n\nSHARE\nSince Visorando is built on a participatory model, we hope you’re going to share your routes with the community too ! GPX export is also possible for those who want to use their tracks on other types of devices.\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN TRACK\nDoes no walking idea fit your desires ? You can create your own route using our FREE walking planner available on the website via PC (and also on mobile if you subscribe to Club Visorando). Once your track is saved to your account, an automatic synchronisation takes place and you can immediately find your route in the app.\n\n__________\n\nPAID VERSION\nAccess to a wide range of licensed maps such as OS Explorer, IGN, Swisstopo, etc. for free for 3 days following your first log in to the app. After that, you should subscribe to the Club Visorando to keep access to them. Quarterly subscription costs £4,99 and annual subscription costs £21,49. \n\nThe subscription will automatically renew unless automatic renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be billed within 24 hours of the end of the current period, for an amount of £21,49 for an annual subscription to the Club Visorando or £4,99 for a quarterly subscription.\n\nThe OpenStreetMap map layer remains completely free. You can therefore continue to use the application for free with this map layer, even if you have passed the trial period for OS Explorer maps.\n\nPurchases are made on iTunes. You will therefore be billed to your iTunes account upon confirmation of your purchase.\nThe subscription will automatically renew unless automatic renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be billed within 24 hours of the end of the current period, for an amount of 21.49£ for an annual Club subscription or 4.99£ for a monthly Club subscription.\nSubscriptions can be managed through iTunes account settings after purchase.\n\nThe OpenStreetMap map layer remains completely free.

Enjoy a personalised experience to plan your journeys through Brussels and beyond, by including STIB-MIVB and the other transport operators in Brussels.  \n\nTo do so, create your account, which will allow you to access a variety of functionalities. You already have a STIB-MIVB account on MyBOOTIK (the online service to purchase transport tickets)? Great! Just use your MyBOOTIK user ID to log on!  \n\nThe itinerary search of the STIB-MIVB App is the best door-to-door solution. Thanks to the positioning system, that includes a transport mode optimisation (on foot, bus, tram, metro or even train), you can get effortlessly from your departure point to your final destination. Launch an itinerary search and follow the instructions. Once you are in your transport mode (bus, tram, metro), the app will warn you to alight when you arrive near your destination. When you finished your itinerary, your journey will be added to your frequently used lines. Moreover, you can find your recent itinerary searches.  \n\nYou wish to think ahead and organise a journey in advance? No problem! Simply register your request and the app will warn you when it's time to go!  \n\nThe disruptions on your frequently used lines and the lines near your position are always available. With one click you can see the waiting time in real time at the stops nearby or the timetables of a line. You can save your favourite destinations and rename them. Thanks to this functionality, you can immediately launch your itinerary until one of your favourite destinations. What's more, you can save a stop or line in your favourites so as to immediately consult the waiting time at the stop and the possible disruptions associated or the detail of the line. \n\nWhen consulting a line, the information regarding lines parallel to this line is easily accessible. It will allow you to manage your journey and to optimise it by taking the first line servicing your stop.\n\nSee our Accessibility compliance statement: https://www.stib-mivb.be/article.html?l=en&_guid=d0f0d466-1483-3410-45af-9748427ab131#contentBodyList6"

SBB Mobile can do it all.

Your travelcards on the SwissPass are applied. \n• Travel particularly affordably with supersaver tickets or Saver Day Passes. \n\nTrips \n• Save your trip and we will provide you with all the information you need during your journey under ‘Single Trips’: everything from departure and arrival times, platform information and service disruptions to train formations and walking routes.  \n• Set up your personal commuter route under ‘Commuting’ and receive push notifications about rail service disruptions. \n• The app accompanies you from door to door as you travel and you will receive information about delays, disruption and interchange times via push notification.  \n\nEasyRide \n• Check in, hop on and head off – across the entire GA Travelcard network. \n• EasyRide calculates the right ticket for your journey on the basis of the routes you travelled and charges you the relevant amount subsequently. \n \nTickets & Travelcards  \n• Show your public transport travelcards digitally with SwissPass Mobile. \n• It also gives you an overview of your valid and expired tickets and travelcards on the SwissPass. \n\nShop & Services  \n• Buy regional transport tickets and Day Passes for the GA Travelcard area of validity quickly and easily without searching the timetable.  \n• In the ‘Services’ section, you can find lots of useful links about travel. \n\nProfile  \n•  Straightforward access to your personal settings and our customer support.  \n\nContact us. \nIf you have any questions, feel free to get in touch: \n \nhttps://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile/contact.html \n \nData security and authorisations. \nWhat permissions does SBB Mobile need and why? \n \nLocation \nFor connections from your current location, the GPS function must be activated so that SBB Mobile can find the nearest stop.

SBB Mobile requires read and write permissions to be able to import your desired connection into the calendar. \n \nAccess to the camera \nSBB Mobile requires access to your camera to take pictures directly in the app for your personalised touch timetable.  \n\nInternet access \nSBB Mobile requires internet access to search the timetable as well as for ticket purchases. \n \nMemory \nTo support offline functions, e.g. station/stop list, connections (history) and purchased tickets, SBB Mobile requires access to your device’s memory (saving app-specific settings)."

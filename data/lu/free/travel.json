Your own two feet, bicycles, buses, trains, the tram and your own car all have a place in the app, which now shows you even smarter routes! Discover the interplay of different modes of transport and create your own personal mobility chain within the app! The “My Mix” tab shows multi-mobile routes that make sense for your needs and preferences.\n\nThe power of the new mobiliteit.lu tool resides in its cooperation with third party mobility services. The planner suggests smart ways to reach your destination thanks to real-time information about the availability of vel’OH! and Vël’Ok bike sharing services, as well as of free spaces at Chargy points for electric cars. It even gives you an availability estimate for these services for a future date! For your travels by car, the planner even notifies you of possible disruptions on the roads in Luxembourg as well as in the Greater Region and shows you Park + Ride offers!"

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others.

This also applies if you want to have the nearest stop displayed in the timetable. \n \nCalendar and e-mail \nYou can save connections in your own calendar and send them by e-mail (to friends, an external calendar). SBB Mobile requires read and write permissions to be able to import your desired connection into the calendar. \n \nAccess to the camera \nSBB Mobile requires access to your camera to take pictures directly in the app for your personalised touch timetable.  \n\nInternet access \nSBB Mobile requires internet access to search the timetable as well as for ticket purchases. \n \nMemory \nTo support offline functions, e.g. station/stop list, connections (history) and purchased tickets, SBB Mobile requires access to your device’s memory (saving app-specific settings)."

It won’t reduce your jet lag and can actually make it worse. Each traveler and trip is different and requires a personalized approach that takes your sleep pattern, chronotype, itinerary, and a range of personal preferences into account.\n\nTimeshifter® is developed by world-renowned scientists based on the latest sleep and circadian neuroscience. With Timeshifter, you can create your own personalized jet lag plans and arrive at your best.\n\nTimeshifter not only provides advice to alleviate the disruptive symptoms of jet lag such as insomnia and sleepiness, but also addresses the underlying circadian disruption by quickly resynchronizing the circadian clock to the new time zone.\n\n–\n\nThe first jet lag plan is free. After your free plan, purchase individual jet lag plans as-you-go or subscribe for unlimited plans. Timeshifter is a paid service.\n\n–\n\nAll the features you need:\n\n// Practicality Filter™ adjusts advice to the \"real world\"\n// Quick Turnaround® advice for short business trips\n// You can start adapting even before your departure\n// Notifications offer advice - even without opening the app\n\n–\n\nTimeshifter is a highly empowering experience, and it requires no special equipment. Just bring a sleep mask and your favorite sunglasses.\n\nJoin the community of Timeshifters around the world who demand a better travel experience. Whether you’re traveling for business, going on vacation, or competing in a sports event abroad, the Timeshifter jet lag app can help optimize your performance, enjoyment, and health when traveling.\n\nTerms of use:\nwww.timeshifter.com/terms/terms-of-use\n\nPrivacy policy:\nwww.timeshifter.com/terms/privacy-policy"

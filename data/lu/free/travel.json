Discover the interplay of different modes of transport and create your own personal mobility chain within the app! The “My Mix” tab shows multi-mobile routes that make sense for your needs and preferences.\n\nThe power of the new mobiliteit.lu tool resides in its cooperation with third party mobility services. The planner suggests smart ways to reach your destination thanks to real-time information about the availability of vel’OH! and Vël’Ok bike sharing services, as well as of free spaces at Chargy points for electric cars. It even gives you an availability estimate for these services for a future date! For your travels by car, the planner even notifies you of possible disruptions on the roads in Luxembourg as well as in the Greater Region and shows you Park + Ride offers!"

Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

You can use Parkmobile to park on the street, or in a car park. \n\nHow does Parkmobile work? \nRegister for free if you don’t have an account yet. Once you’ve parked your car, open the app, check the zone code based on your GPS location and press ‘Start’. Your parking action will be transmitted to parking enforcement officers based on your number plate, so you don’t need to worry about getting a ticket. An email, or SMS notification will help remind you about your active parking session. When you return to your vehicle, open the app and press ‘Stop’ to end the parking session. You can settle the parking costs on a monthly basis using a payment method of your choice. \n \nFeatures you’ll love: \n» See where you're most likely to find a parking spot by using Find & Park. Available in Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, Utrecht, and Leiden, with more locations coming soon! \n\n» Find parking options, fees, and other parking info close to your destination or any location you search for in the app. \n\n» Find parking areas based on GPS location for added convenience. Just double check that the zone code in the app matches the zone code in the street or car park. \n\n» Reserve your parking spot in advance via the app. Available at Schiphol Airport, Rotterdam, The Hague Airport, and over 200 ParkBee garages across the Netherlands. \n\n» Use multiple vehicles for one account, with the option to add or update vehicles in just a few taps. \n \n» Switch between a Private and Business account easily so you can use one app for both your personal and professional parking, with the option to easily declare business expenses. \n \n» Set up SMS or email reminders to keep track of active parking sessions. Receive a notification when parking locations have a maximum time limit, so that you can say goodbye to preventable parking fines. What's more, you can also activate reminders based on your GPS location.  \n \n» Get a handy overview of your parking activity in the app. See where you parked, how long you stayed, and much it cost. All parking transactions are provided in one monthly invoice. \n\n» Save your favourite parking locations, so you can find your frequently-visited parking spots even faster.\n\n» Found a parking spot? Directly navigate there using your preferred app with one simple tap! \n \nWhere can you use it? \nYou can use the Parkmobile app in many cities in the UK, The Netherlands and Belgium.

      "label": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\n\nTaxify your life with the Yango taxi app. It puts the whole city in your hands and lets you ride wherever you want to go via taxi. Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango. These scooters are bright yellow (not lime green), so you can't miss them! Easily order a scooter, find locations on the map (they look like a dot), and build routes with the same high-quality scooters you know and love, all in one convenient, top-tier app. We offer free unlocks and 20 NIS discounts on the first 3 rides to everyone who loves the feel of the wind in their hair. Just log into Yango, select scooters, and enjoy your three free unlocks!\n\nMeet Delivery in Israel - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier all around the Gush Dan district. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car.\n\nEnjoy your ride!\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the Yango taxi app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at yango.com/en_gh/support/\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties. \nUp to 50% (max 6 GHC/5 GHC) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Accra/Kumasi until 31.12.2022.\nThe 30% (max 10 EUR) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Helsinki until 31.12.2022. The 30% (max 100 kr) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Oslo until 31.12.2022.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions"

Save hundreds of dollars compared to other travel sites.\n\nDiscover extraordinary travel deals, set fare alerts, and uncover great hotel rates.\n\nWe’re so good, United Airlines actually sued us for it!\n\n• Find flights other search engines won’t show you -- including HIDDEN-CITY flights and arbitrary round-trips\n• Filter flights by duration, number of layovers, takeoff/landing time and more\n• Our powerful search engine pulls in the best deals to save you from having to google flights and check multiple sites\n• Monitor prices for trips you have in the hopper and let us alert you when the best deal is available\n• Book hotels as well, including last-minute hotels and special deals\n• Filter hotels, read reviews and view traveler ratings\n• We now offer car rental as well, so you can use one app as your complete trip planner\n• Our new Stories feature lets you book activities for your vacation - take a brewery tour, rent a kayak, or buy tickets in advance and get your guide to museums and exhibits\n\nThe fine print: a HIDDEN-CITY flight is a flight where you get off at the layover rather than the final destination. For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

      "label": "The most-used e-scooter sharing app in Europe. Travel quickly whenever you want through the city on an electric shared scooter. Find a felyx e-scooter in your neighbourhood, book it and activate it through the app and off you go!  \n \n\nFelyx e-scooter sharing is now available in more than 10 cities in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Groningen, Brussels, Berlin, Hamburg and many more! \n\nThe benefits of the felyx e-scooter app: \n\n• Reserving: snag it. You can book an e-scooter for free for up to 10 minutes, after which you pay €0.15 per extended minute.  \n\n•  Smart radar function: get a notification when a shared scooter becomes free in your area. \n\n•  Earn free riding minutes: invite your friends and receive 15 free minutes of riding per registered friend.  \n\n•  Parking mode: would you like to park the felyx e-scooter for a while, but not run the risk of someone else renting it? Use the parking mode and keep the shared scooter for €0.10/min (NL) or €0,13 p/m (DE) and €0.15 p/m (BE). \n\n•  Smartphone charger: charge your smartphone while you ride. Use the USB port and your own USB cable as soon as the e-scooter is activated.  \n\n•  Battery status: overview of the battery capacity of each e-scooter before you book. \n\nHow does the felyx e-scooter sharing app work? \n\n1. Register in just a few minutes \n\nSimply register with the practical driver's license verification system in the app. Add your payment information and you're ready to ride.  \n\n2. Finding & renting \n\nUse the app to find a felyx scooter near you and make a reservation at the push of a button. \n\n3. Activate & off you go! \n\nActivate the e-scooter in the app and ride anywhere within the service area quickly and carefree. We make sure batteries are full and maintenance is taken care of. \n\n4. Parking & locking \n\nArrived safe? Park properly in the service area and end the rental via the app. No-hassle payment, minutes ridden are automatically debited from your bank account.  \n\n\nFrequently asked questions about felyx e-scooter sharing: \nWhat do you do regarding the hygiene of a felyx e-scooter? \nBoth e-scooters and helmets are cleaned and disinfected on a daily basis. All e-scooters capable of going 45 km/h are equipped with helmets and hairnets.  \n\nI don't live in a city with felyx, can I hire an e-scooter? \nYes, you can! Registering is quick and easy. Just choose the city you are planning to make your first ride \n\nWhat does felyx cost? \nWith felyx, you only pay for what you use. In the Netherlands and Belgium, you pay from €0.25/min and in Germany you’re paying from €0.18/min \n\nAt the moment, you don't pay any registration fee, but we do charge unlock fee of €0.50 per ride. \n\nDo I need a driver's license and if so, what type? \nClass B (which also allows you to drive a car), class A or a moped license (class AM). \n\nCan I drive and park outside a service area? \nYou can drive the felyx e-scooter outside the green marked areas in the app. However, activating and ending the rental is only possible within those green areas. It is possible to use the parking mode outside the service area at €0.10 p/m (NL), €0,13 p/m (DE) and €0.15 p/m (BE). The service area for a given city can be found on our website and on the map in the app. Make sure you park the felyx e-scooter properly: do not block the pavement for pedestrians, wheelchairs and prams. \n \nAbout felyx e-scooter sharing \nWe are a Dutch scale-up with ambitious plans for sustainable suburban transport.

      "label": "Intuitive and simple, Visorando turns your mobile phone into a walking GPS ! With the app, you can :\n\nFIND ROUTES IDEAS\nYou will find varied and quality walking routes throughout the UK and around the world. The quality of the routes we suggest is our main concern. This is why each track is checked by a team of moderators before being published and shared with the community.\n\nKNOW YOUR POSITION\nIn real time, you can consult your position on the map layer you have chosen. This will allow you to better locate yourself and also visualise the points of interest around you.\n\nBE GUIDED\nOnce the walk has been selected and your preferred map layer is chosen, the app will safely guide you on the right route with detailed and verified directions. Even offline, the app will be able to guide you !\n\nRECORD YOUR TRACKS\nAt the same time as following the guidance, you have the possibility to record your own track. In this way, you can then analyse it, compare it, share it or simply redo it later.\n\nSHARE\nSince Visorando is built on a participatory model, we hope you’re going to share your routes with the community too ! GPX export is also possible for those who want to use their tracks on other types of devices.\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN TRACK\nDoes no walking idea fit your desires ? You can create your own route using our FREE walking planner available on the website via PC (and also on mobile if you subscribe to Club Visorando). Once your track is saved to your account, an automatic synchronisation takes place and you can immediately find your route in the app.\n\n__________\n\nPAID VERSION\nAccess to a wide range of licensed maps such as OS Explorer, IGN, Swisstopo, etc. for free for 3 days following your first log in to the app. After that, you should subscribe to the Club Visorando to keep access to them. Quarterly subscription costs £4,99 and annual subscription costs £21,49. \n\nThe subscription will automatically renew unless automatic renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be billed within 24 hours of the end of the current period, for an amount of £21,49 for an annual subscription to the Club Visorando or £4,99 for a quarterly subscription.\n\nThe OpenStreetMap map layer remains completely free. You can therefore continue to use the application for free with this map layer, even if you have passed the trial period for OS Explorer maps.\n\nPurchases are made on iTunes. You will therefore be billed to your iTunes account upon confirmation of your purchase.\nThe subscription will automatically renew unless automatic renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be billed within 24 hours of the end of the current period, for an amount of 21.49£ for an annual Club subscription or 4.99£ for a monthly Club subscription.\nSubscriptions can be managed through iTunes account settings after purchase.\n\nThe OpenStreetMap map layer remains completely free. You can therefore continue to use the application for free with this map layer, even if you have passed the trial period for OS Explorer and IGN maps.\n\n———\n\nTerms and Conditions and Privacy Policy: https://www.visorando.co.uk/privacy-policy.html"

      "label": "Buy one of our prepaid eSIM plans at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) in over 190+ countries and regions to enjoy global connectivity!\nAdd a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and stop worrying about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

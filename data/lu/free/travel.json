Your own two feet, bicycles, buses, trains, the tram and your own car all have a place in the app, which now shows you even smarter routes! Discover the interplay of different modes of transport and create your own personal mobility chain within the app! The “My Mix” tab shows multi-mobile routes that make sense for your needs and preferences.\n\nThe power of the new mobiliteit.lu tool resides in its cooperation with third party mobility services. The planner suggests smart ways to reach your destination thanks to real-time information about the availability of vel’OH! and Vël’Ok bike sharing services, as well as of free spaces at Chargy points for electric cars. It even gives you an availability estimate for these services for a future date! For your travels by car, the planner even notifies you of possible disruptions on the roads in Luxembourg as well as in the Greater Region and shows you Park + Ride offers!"

Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24.

      "label": "The most-used e-scooter sharing app in Europe. Travel quickly whenever you want through the city on an electric shared scooter. Find a felyx e-scooter in your neighbourhood, book it and activate it through the app and off you go!  \n \n\nFelyx e-scooter sharing is now available in more than 10 cities in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Groningen, Brussels, Berlin, Hamburg and many more! \n\nThe benefits of the felyx e-scooter app: \n\n● Reserving: snag it. You can book an e-scooter for free for up to 10 minutes, after which you pay €0.15 per extended minute.  \n\n● Smart radar function: get a notification when a shared scooter becomes free in your area. \n\n● Earn free riding minutes: invite your friends and receive 15 free minutes of riding per registered friend.  \n\n● Parking mode: would you like to park the felyx e-scooter for a while, but not run the risk of someone else renting it? Use the parking mode and keep the shared scooter for €0.10/min (NL) or €0,13 p/m (DE) and €0.15 p/m (BE). \n\n● Smartphone charger: charge your smartphone while you ride. Use the USB port and your own USB cable as soon as the e-scooter is activated.  \n\n● Battery status: overview of the battery capacity of each e-scooter before you book. \n\nHow does the felyx e-scooter sharing app work? \n\n1. Register in just a few minutes \n\nSimply register with the practical driver's license verification system in the app. Add your payment information and you're ready to ride.  \n\n2. Finding & renting \n\nUse the app to find a felyx scooter near you and make a reservation at the push of a button. \n\n3. Activate & off you go! \n\nActivate the e-scooter in the app and ride anywhere within the service area quickly and carefree. We make sure batteries are full and maintenance is taken care of. \n\n4. Parking & locking \n\nArrived safe? Park properly in the service area and end the rental via the app. No-hassle payment, minutes ridden are automatically debited from your bank account.  \n\n\nFrequently asked questions about felyx e-scooter sharing: \nWhat do you do regarding the hygiene of a felyx e-scooter? \nBoth e-scooters and helmets are cleaned and disinfected on a daily basis. All e-scooters capable of going 45 km/h are equipped with helmets and hairnets.  \n\nI don't live in a city with felyx, can I hire an e-scooter? \nYes, you can! Registering is quick and easy. Just choose the city you are planning to make your first ride \n\nWhat does felyx cost? \nWith felyx, you only pay for what you use. In the Netherlands and Belgium, you pay from €0.25/min and in Germany you’re paying from €0.18/min \n\nAt the moment, you don't pay any registration fee, but we do charge unlock fee of €0.50 per ride. \n\nDo I need a driver's license and if so, what type? \nClass B (which also allows you to drive a car), class A or a moped license (class AM). \n\nCan I drive and park outside a service area? \nYou can drive the felyx e-scooter outside the green marked areas in the app. However, activating and ending the rental is only possible within those green areas. It is possible to use the parking mode outside the service area at €0.10 p/m (NL), €0,13 p/m (DE) and €0.15 p/m (BE). The service area for a given city can be found on our website and on the map in the app. Make sure you park the felyx e-scooter properly: do not block the pavement for pedestrians, wheelchairs and prams. \n \nAbout felyx e-scooter sharing \nWe are a Dutch scale-up with ambitious plans for sustainable suburban transport. Want to know more about us? Do you have suggestions or ideas? Send us an e-mail (klantenservice@felyx.nl) or visit our website."

      "label": "Yango is an easy-to-use app for getting around the city\n\nTaxify your life with the Yango taxi app. It puts the whole city in your hands and lets you ride wherever you want to go via taxi. Do it all by making a taxi order via the Yango taxi app.\n\nChoose the right service class for you\n\nReach your destination at the right level of comfort and price for you. Choose from several service classes. Start is perfect for short rides. Economy is awesome for when you need a car fast. Comfort lets you sit back and enjoy the ride. And The Fastest offers rides when the service class doesn’t matter… you need the closest available taxi!\n\nRide safely\n\nSafety is our top priority. You’ll see who’s coming to pick you up and in which car right in the app. You’ll see the driver’s name and rating and be able to share your ride with whomever you like so they know where you are.\n\nSmart destinations\n\nYango will suggest destinations for your taxi ride based on your ride history, like first offering ‘home’ as a destination because it’s your most common taxi order on weekday evenings. Ride taxis the smart way!\n\nMultiple destinations, one route\n\nThe Yango taxi app makes everyday life easier. Like picking the kids up from school, dropping a friend off at a market, and doing some quick shopping on the way. Just add a new taxi order stop in the app, and Yango will recalculate a new route for the driver. That makes it even easier to ride a taxi.\n\nOrder for someone else\n\nYango lets you order friends and loved ones a ride by taxi. Get your mother to a doctor’s appointment with a taxi order. Send a taxi online to pick up your special someone. Or get each of your friends a ride home after a night out. You can order up to 3 cars at once.\n\nTell your friends about the Yango taxi app and get discounts\n\nYou can get discounts for your rides by inviting friends to use the Yango app. Share your personal promo code with them and receive bonuses when they take their first ride. Ride taxi, tell friends, save. It’s as easy as that.\n\nAn international service\n\nYango is a ride-hailing service that operates mobility and delivery aggregators in 19 countries, including Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Senegal and Zambia.\n\nIsrael Only\n3 free Wind scooter ride unlocks and a 20 NIS discount\nA little birdie told us that Wind scooters are now available in Yango. These scooters are bright yellow (not lime green), so you can't miss them! Easily order a scooter, find locations on the map (they look like a dot), and build routes with the same high-quality scooters you know and love, all in one convenient, top-tier app. We offer free unlocks and 20 NIS discounts on the first 3 rides to everyone who loves the feel of the wind in their hair. Just log into Yango, select scooters, and enjoy your three free unlocks!\n\nMeet Delivery in Israel - it's like a taxi service, but for your packages\n\nWe've also built in a fast delivery service into Yango - use Delivery to quickly send personal packages or even business orders by courier all around the Gush Dan district. Delivery is suitable for any item that can be transported by scooter or car.\n\nEnjoy your ride!\n\nIf you would like to share your feedback on the Yango taxi app or a specific taxi company, please use the feedback form located at yango.com/en_gh/support/\n\nYango is an informational service and not a transportation or taxi services provider. Transportation services are provided by third parties. \nUp to 50% (max 6 GHC/5 GHC) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Accra/Kumasi until 31.12.2022.\nThe 30% (max 10 EUR) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Helsinki until 31.12.2022. The 30% (max 100 kr) discount is valid on the first three rides for new users in Oslo until 31.12.2022.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://yango.com/legal/yango_privacy_notice\nYango Plus subscription conditions:\nhttps://deli.yango.com/en-IL/about/docs/legal/yango_plus_conditions"

Your own two feet, bicycles, buses, trains, the tram and your own car all have a place in the app, which now shows you even smarter routes! Discover the interplay of different modes of transport and create your own personal mobility chain within the app! The “My Mix” tab shows multi-mobile routes that make sense for your needs and preferences.\n\nThe power of the new mobiliteit.lu tool resides in its cooperation with third party mobility services. The planner suggests smart ways to reach your destination thanks to real-time information about the availability of vel’OH! and Vël’Ok bike sharing services, as well as of free spaces at Chargy points for electric cars. It even gives you an availability estimate for these services for a future date! For your travels by car, the planner even notifies you of possible disruptions on the roads in Luxembourg as well as in the Greater Region and shows you Park + Ride offers!"

For example, a flight from New York to San Francisco might be $300, but a similar flight from New York to Seattle with a layover in San Francisco might be $200. If you’re going to San Francisco we’ll show you both flights, and if you choose the cheaper one, you get off the plane at the layover (San Francisco) rather than going to the final destination (Seattle).\n\nThis is perfectly legal and the savings can be significant, but if you’ve never traveled like this before, you should read our HIDDEN-CITY FAQ at http://skiplagged.com/faq\n\nWe’ll always show you all the options, so YOU can pick the deal you want!"

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

      "label": "Buy one of our prepaid eSIM plans at affordable rates (starting from $4.50) in over 190+ countries and regions to enjoy global connectivity!\nAdd a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and stop worrying about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\n.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM. The advantage is that you no longer need a fiddly, easily lost old-school plastic SIM card that you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIMs are a true technological revolution and we bring them right into your eSIM-compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or paying for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your existing phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store over time.  Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find a regularly updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link:\nhttps://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who travels - it doesn't matter whether you're on a boat, a plane, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries. We’re here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more huge data roaming fees\n* Installation in just a couple of minutes\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your existing number while traveling \n* No more fiddling with pins and paperclips to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky WiFi dongle around\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM\nThere are three ways to install your eSIM; most can be installed directly, if this isn’t possible you can use a QR code or install it manually. \n\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fiddly hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things simpler for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans. Every eSIM from Airalo is prepaid and requires no contract, so you can top-up your service or switch your plan whenever you want.\n* Prices are clear and fair with no hidden fees.\n* You can store multiple eSIMs on one device. That gives you the freedom to purchase your eSIMs ahead of time and simply activate them on arrival.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nVisit airalo.com for more information.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/privacy-policy\nTerms & Conditions: https://www.airalo.com/more-info/terms-conditions"

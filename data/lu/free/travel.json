Your own two feet, bicycles, buses, trains, the tram and your own car all have a place in the app, which now shows you even smarter routes! Discover the interplay of different modes of transport and create your own personal mobility chain within the app! The “My Mix” tab shows multi-mobile routes that make sense for your needs and preferences.\n\nThe power of the new mobiliteit.lu tool resides in its cooperation with third party mobility services. The planner suggests smart ways to reach your destination thanks to real-time information about the availability of vel’OH! and Vël’Ok bike sharing services, as well as of free spaces at Chargy points for electric cars. It even gives you an availability estimate for these services for a future date! For your travels by car, the planner even notifies you of possible disruptions on the roads in Luxembourg as well as in the Greater Region and shows you Park + Ride offers!"

Silver and Gold upgrade prices are listed in the app as they vary depending on your country and currency. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nMost aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B transponders that transmit positional data. Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes. This specifically excludes activities that might endanger yourself or the lives of others. Under no circumstances will the developer of this app be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation or its use contrary to this agreement.\n\nTerms of Service: https://www.flightradar24.com/terms-and-conditions"

      "label": "The STIB-MIVB App is your partner for all your journeys through Brussels! Enjoy a personalised experience to plan your journeys through Brussels and beyond, by including STIB-MIVB and the other transport operators in Brussels.  \n\nTo do so, create your account, which will allow you to access a variety of functionalities. You already have a STIB-MIVB account on MyBOOTIK (the online service to purchase transport tickets)? Great! Just use your MyBOOTIK user ID to log on!  \n\nThe itinerary search of the STIB-MIVB App is the best door-to-door solution. Thanks to the positioning system, that includes a transport mode optimisation (on foot, bus, tram, metro or even train), you can get effortlessly from your departure point to your final destination. Launch an itinerary search and follow the instructions. Once you are in your transport mode (bus, tram, metro), the app will warn you to alight when you arrive near your destination. When you finished your itinerary, your journey will be added to your frequently used lines. Moreover, you can find your recent itinerary searches.  \n\nYou wish to think ahead and organise a journey in advance? No problem! Simply register your request and the app will warn you when it's time to go!  \n\nThe disruptions on your frequently used lines and the lines near your position are always available. With one click you can see the waiting time in real time at the stops nearby or the timetables of a line. You can save your favourite destinations and rename them. Thanks to this functionality, you can immediately launch your itinerary until one of your favourite destinations. What's more, you can save a stop or line in your favourites so as to immediately consult the waiting time at the stop and the possible disruptions associated or the detail of the line. \n\nWhen consulting a line, the information regarding lines parallel to this line is easily accessible. It will allow you to manage your journey and to optimise it by taking the first line servicing your stop.\n\nSee our Accessibility compliance statement: https://www.stib-mivb.be/article.html?l=en&_guid=d0f0d466-1483-3410-45af-9748427ab131#contentBodyList6"

After your trip, share a travel guide to inspire other travelers.\n\n- See flights, hotels, and attractions in one place (like TripIt and Tripcase)\n- View plans on a travel map & map your route (like Roadtrippers)\n- Rearrange the order of places easily by drag-and-drop\n- Planning a road trip? Add unlimited stops for free, optimize your route, view times & distances between places, and export places to Google Maps\n- Planning group travel? Invite friends and collaborate in real-time just (like Google Docs)\n- Automatically import reservations by forwarding emails or connecting your Gmail\n- Add things to do from top guides with 1 click (like Tripadvisor and Google Trips/Google Travel)\n- Access your trip plans offline\n- Add notes and links to your stops\n- Have your trip plans automatically sync across devices\n- Set budget, track expenses, and split bills with a group\n\n-------\n\nSEE IT ON A MAP\n\nEvery time you add a place to visit, it’s immediately pinned on your Google Maps-based travel map. No need to pull up different travel apps and websites to organize plans and see them on a map - you can do it all in the Wanderlog trip planner app! Plus, if you’re visiting points in order, lines will connect the different pins on the map so you can see your route (perfect for road trips!). You can also export all your places to Google Maps too.\n\nSTORE PLANS OFFLINE\n\nAll your plans are automatically stored offline on the Wanderlog travel planner app - especially helpful during a road trip with poor signal and international travel.\n\nGET ON THE ROAD\n\nLooking for a road trip planner? Travelers can plan their trips and stops with Wanderlog. See your route on a map, or try our route optimizer to automatically rearrange and plan your route to save travel time. See estimated times & distance traveled between places to make sure it all fits, and total time and distance traveled for a given day to make sure you’re not driving too long. Plus, you can add unlimited stops along your road trip for free.\n\nCOLLABORATE WITH FRIENDS\n\nFor group travel planning, add your tripmates with their email address or by sharing a link to the itinerary. Like for Google Docs, everyone can collaborate in real-time. Set permissions and choose whether people can edit or just view your travel plans.\n\nSTAY ORGANIZED\n\nAccess flights, hotels, and attractions in one app. Forward flight and hotel confirmation emails to import them directly into your trip plan, or connect your Gmail to automatically add them. Prefer to keep high-level plans? Make generic lists like ‘Things to do’ and ‘Restaurants’ you want to eat at. Traveling on a tight schedule and want to create a detailed itinerary? Organize your day by adding start (and end) times, perfect for keeping track of tickets and reservations.\n\nGET INSPIRATION & INFORMATION\n\nFor each place, see key info like a description and picture of the place, average user ratings with links to reviews, opening hours, address, website, and phone number. Stay inspired by exploring top travel guides from the web that feature viewpoints, attractions, and restaurants, and from lists from Google Trips and Google Travel, as well as by other Wanderlog users, and add things to do from those guides to your trip plan with 1 click.\n\nCONTROL YOUR SPENDING\n\nSet a budget for yourself or a group. Take control of your spending and keep track of all expenses. For a group trip, split a bill with other people and easily calculate the cost. Keep a record of who paid for what, how much everyone owes or is owed, and settle debts between tripmates."

Your own two feet, bicycles, buses, trains, the tram and your own car all have a place in the app, which now shows you even smarter routes! Discover the interplay of different modes of transport and create your own personal mobility chain within the app! The “My Mix” tab shows multi-mobile routes that make sense for your needs and preferences.\n\nThe power of the new mobiliteit.lu tool resides in its cooperation with third party mobility services. The planner suggests smart ways to reach your destination thanks to real-time information about the availability of vel’OH! and Vël’Ok bike sharing services, as well as of free spaces at Chargy points for electric cars. It even gives you an availability estimate for these services for a future date! For your travels by car, the planner even notifies you of possible disruptions on the roads in Luxembourg as well as in the Greater Region and shows you Park + Ride offers!"

Flightradar24 has a rapidly growing network of 20,000 ground stations to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions, with the help of multilateration, we’re able to calculate the positions of aircraft that don’t have ADS-B transponders. Coverage is subject to change at any time.\n\nCONNECT WITH FLIGHTRADAR24\nWe love getting feedback on FR24. Since we’re unable to respond directly to reviews, contact us directly and we’ll be happy to assist if you’re having any issues.\n• email (support@fr24.com)\n• twitter (@flightradar24)\n• Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Flightradar24)\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe use of this app is strictly limited to entertainment purposes.

Enjoy a personalised experience to plan your journeys through Brussels and beyond, by including STIB-MIVB and the other transport operators in Brussels.  \n\nTo do so, create your account, which will allow you to access a variety of functionalities. You already have a STIB-MIVB account on MyBOOTIK (the online service to purchase transport tickets)? Great! Just use your MyBOOTIK user ID to log on!  \n\nThe itinerary search of the STIB-MIVB App is the best door-to-door solution. Thanks to the positioning system, that includes a transport mode optimisation (on foot, bus, tram, metro or even train), you can get effortlessly from your departure point to your final destination. Launch an itinerary search and follow the instructions. Once you are in your transport mode (bus, tram, metro), the app will warn you to alight when you arrive near your destination. When you finished your itinerary, your journey will be added to your frequently used lines. Moreover, you can find your recent itinerary searches.  \n\nYou wish to think ahead and organise a journey in advance? No problem! Simply register your request and the app will warn you when it's time to go!  \n\nThe disruptions on your frequently used lines and the lines near your position are always available. With one click you can see the waiting time in real time at the stops nearby or the timetables of a line. You can save your favourite destinations and rename them. Thanks to this functionality, you can immediately launch your itinerary until one of your favourite destinations. What's more, you can save a stop or line in your favourites so as to immediately consult the waiting time at the stop and the possible disruptions associated or the detail of the line. \n\nWhen consulting a line, the information regarding lines parallel to this line is easily accessible. It will allow you to manage your journey and to optimise it by taking the first line servicing your stop.\n\nSee our Accessibility compliance statement: https://www.stib-mivb.be/article.html?l=en&_guid=d0f0d466-1483-3410-45af-9748427ab131#contentBodyList6"

Add a data pack to your dual SIM iPhone or iPad and never worry about staying connected while on your adventures.\n\nSay 'alo' to freedom!\n\nWhat is an eSIM?\n* An eSIM is embedded SIM technology. Think of it as a digital SIM card. Rather than requiring users to fiddle with SIM trays and pins, the eSIM operates within your device's firmware.\n\nWhat is an eSIM data plan?\n* An eSIM data plan is a prepaid data-only plan that you can install directly to your eSIM-compatible device. Think of it as a lightweight prepaid plan or virtual data SIM for whatever local carriers exist in the country you’re currently in, but without this old-school plastic SIM card you can easily lose in your pockets. eSIM is a true technological revolution and we bring it right into your eSIM compatible device!\n* You get access to local data services at affordable prices without the need to hunt down a physical SIM card, WiFi or pay for expensive roaming.\n* You can continue to use your own phone number while using the data from your eSIM.\n\nDoes an eSIM come with a number?\n* Some of our eSIMs do and we're working on adding more into our store for your convenience. Check your eSIM’s description for details.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n* eSIMs from Airalo start from $4.50 for 1GB of data.\n\nWhat devices are ready?\nYou can find an updated list of eSIM compatible devices on this link: https://www.airalo.com/help/about-airalo/what-devices-support-esim\n\nWho is Airalo best for?\nAiralo is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to get connected during their travels - it doesn't matter whether you're a seafarer, flight crew, on a business trip or you just want to enjoy mobile data while visiting other countries -  We are here to provide you with instant connectivity and solve your travel connectivity problems.\n\nWhy use Airalo?\n* No more enormous roaming data fees\n* Installation in 2 minutes or less\n* Easy top-ups, wherever you are\n* Keep your number as you travel\n* No more fumbling to change SIMs\n* No need to carry a bulky Wi-Fi dongle around\n\nHow does it work?\n* Step 1: Install the Airalo app\n* Step 2: Find an eSIM for your destination\n(Airalo has eSIMs for over 190+ countries and regions and we're working 24/7 to expand our coverage.)\n* Step 3: Purchase & install your eSIM You can install your eSIM directly or by scanning a QR code or manually inserting an activation code provided. You can also manage and top-up your eSIMs with your Airalo account.\n* Step 4: Enjoy connectivity whenever you are!\n\nWhy do we love eSIM?\n* You aren’t disconnected during transit. With an eSIM, you can simply activate your service once you’ve arrived and you’re connected immediately.\n* You don’t have to mess around with fragile, tiny hardware. Your eSIM is handled through an app, making things easier for everyone.\n* It’s much easier to switch plans.

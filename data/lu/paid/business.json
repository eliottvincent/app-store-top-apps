In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS."

      "label": "5 Stars. “I can't tell you how often I use it, probably about as much as the phone app!\" \n- CharlieW, President. Waterman & Company (Real Estate Investment and Development)\n\n“This is the first 12C type calculator for the itouch that has actually made me put down my real 12C. One of the best features of this calculator is the register display where you can see what is in FV, I, PV, PMT, etc. That alone makes it worth the $14.95 price. Consider the many other features that it has over and above the real 12C and you have one sweet program here. Best of the 12C emulators out there - hands down! “\n- tsinvest\n\nIt started in early 2008 with a belief that:\n • there was one and only one insanely great financial calculator\n • the iPhone is the perfect platform to bring that calculator back to life\n • it's not good enough to just copy the old, you have to make it better\n • a financial calculator is a professional tool, not a game\n \nFrom this mindset came Calc-12E, the first 12C emulator on the App Store. It was expensive back then ($20-$25) and compared to a game it still is because, well, you usually get what you pay for. Specifically:\n\nForemost, if the math isn't right in the corner cases I can't trust the calculator. Calc-12E's algorithms were written for iOS by a (the?) key member of the original 12C development team who incorporated his solutions to the quirks in financial computation that historically tripped up lesser implementations. There are reasons the 12C was the absolute best, and Calc-12E draws directly on that heritage.\n \nWhile the original did what it could, 1980s technology made many features difficult, impractical or impossible to use. Calc-12E pioneered the following innovations to address shortcomings:\n    • you can always see what's in the financial registers (and stack if you choose) so you have instant assurance that you've entered your data correctly. This feature has been copied by nearly every emulator on the App Store, for good reason.\n    • visual cash flow editing radically eases how you deal with cash flows... believe it or not it is actually easy to manipulate cash flows with Calc-12E. There's a demo on YouTube, search for Calc12E.\n    • Investment mode allows you to simultaneously evaluate metrics on up to three cash flow scenarios at a time. You can compare cash flows side-by-side AND because of visual cash flow editing you can play what-if games\n    • the results of some calculations need to \"leave the phone\" to be useful. Amortization schedules, leasing terms, bond yields... everything can be sent via email using customizable templates\n    \nFinally, a professional tool receives continuing support and updates. It does not nag you to rate it, it does not invite you to pay to get more. It does not crash. Check out Calc-12E's version history and reviews of previous versions. This is a live, supported app with tens of thousands of long term customers and I have never charged for an upgrade or cloaked features behind ads or paywalls. It's not ethical at this level (in my humble opinion!).\n\nWhen you buy Calc-12E you get my best (and evolving!) rendition of the most popular handheld calculator ever made. It's core (the math) comes from the same mind as your trusty original and to that foundation you get usability advances that actually enhance the overall tool."

For example, give your employees access to a product information or an asset tracking app on their iPhone, over the internet or your intranet.\n\nEAN and UPC barcodes can be read even on devices without autofocus.\n\n\nTHIS IS NOT A SHOPPING APP.

Home Page URL: the url of the web page displayed when the app launches (optional).\n\n2. Barcode Lookup URL: the url fetched when a barcode is scanned.  The string CODE is replaced by the barcode content, and the string FORMAT is replaced by the symbology of the decoded barcode.  That is how the barcode information is transmitted to your web app, and how the response is displayed to the user.\n\n3. Send GPS coordinates: add a \"&gps=latitude,longitude\" to the lookup URL.\n\n4. Formats: select which formats the scanner needs to look for.  We recommend turning off the formats that are not needed for speed.\n\nPlease note that you can include as many other parameters as you like in either URL, they will be passed as is to your server.  For example, you could give to each user a URL with a different \"&userid=NNN\" parameter to automatically identify them with the web application. \n\nA quick way to configure pic2shop PRO is to send a link to each user (by email or on a web page).  When they click the link after they have installed pic2shop PRO, the three parameters will be set automatically.  The link has the form:\n\np2spro://configure?lookup={lookupURL}&home={homeURL}&formats=EAN13,EAN8,UPCE,ITF,CODE39,CODE128,CODABAR,QR&gps={YES|NO}&settings={YES|NO}\n\nwhere any special character in {lookupURL} and {homeURL} is replaced by its % encoding.  For example, to make pic2shop PRO lookup the UPC database:\n\np2spro://configure?lookup=http%3A//www.upcdatabase.com/item/CODE\n\n5. Auto Orientation: scan Code39, Code128, ITF and Codabar in landscape (as they can be wider than UPCs)\n6. High Resolution: use high resolution scanning (for large barcodes)\n7. Copy to clipboard\n\nIn addition, one can switch off the in-app configuration in the general iOS settings list to help lock down the config.\n\n= PIC2SHOP PRO AS EXTERNAL SCANNER =\n\nPic2shop PRO, can be launched by another app or by a web page to scan a barcode, then pass the result back to the calling app or web page.  A popular use is to import barcodes into the Filemaker Go application.\n\nThe syntax of the custom URL is the following:\n\np2spro://scan?formats=EAN13,EAN8,UPCE,ITF,CODE39,CODE128,CODABAR,QR&callback={callbackURL}\n\nThe callback URL should be percent-encoded and contain the strings CODE and FORMAT, which will be replaced by the barcode content (or 'CANCELLED') and symbology, respectively.\n\n= START SCANNER FROM IN-APP BROWSER =\n\nThe barcode scanner can also be started from the embedded browser with link to a \"p2spro://scan\" URL like described above, which overrides the lookup URL and barcode formats for a single scan. Javascript callbacks are supported.\n\n= NOTES =\n\nFor security reasons, HTTPS will not work with self-signed certificates."

      "label": "Ever since Daniel Ofman in his first book Core Qualities, a Gateway to Human Resources (1992) introduced the Core Quadrant as an easy, simple and very effective way to discover your core qualities, pitfalls, challenges and allergies, core quadrants became part of the Dutch educational system. \nIn the business world, from Universities to high schools to primary schools, everywhere people are encouraged to explore their strength (core quality), their weakness (pitfall), their learning points (challenges) and their personal judgements (allergies). Without exception participants are surprised, inspired and excited to discover the relationships between these four aspects in themselves and others. By now more then a million Dutch people know about core quadrants, and over 100.000 copies of his book have been sold (in the Dutch language only). Core quadrants have virtually become part of the language.\nRecognition and admission are characteristic reactions from each individual who is introduced to the simplicity and logic which made core quadrants so immensely popular.\n \nWith this application you can go one step further. Thru a 16-step Self Analysis you can build and store 16 core quadrants.\nWhat makes this application unique, is the module Daily Reflection, which enables you to reflect on your daily interactions with others or your own behaviour. The application will then look for correlations between the core quadrants you made earlier and the issue you are reflecting on. It will then either give you feedback or invite you to make a new core quadrant. The application is designed to help you to translate the initial insights you got when you built your first core quadrants, into daily practice, in order to benefit from your increased awarenes. Somewhere in Daniel Ofman's latest book on core qualities \"Fancy Meeting Me Here..!?\" it is mentioned: \"The world is not waiting for people to become aware of their core qualities. The world is waiting for people who are willing to make their awareness productive and have meaningful interactions. When awareness about yourself has no effect on what you do and how you deal with people, building a core quadrant makes no sense and is a useless exercise.\"\n   \nWhy do so many people nowadays spend so little time to reflect? Maybe it is because the price we have to pay for awareness is simply too high. This price is namely responsibility. Once you realise and see what is going on and why you behave the way you do, it automatically makes you responsible. Next time you can't say anymore you didn't know. People are not bad, people are often unconscious and the moment you wake up, you bear responsibility and not everyone likes that. This app is meant for people who want to take responsibility for their own lives and their part in relationships with others. Usually this brings success as well as joy."

This implies you need to make sure that your ESX hosts have IP addresses that are *routable*, otherwise you will not be able to access the VNC console. IPs in the form 10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x are *not* routable, if your ESX has one of these, you will not be able to access the console through vCenter. Even if the IPs are routable, you need to make sure that the port configured (in the range 5900-5909) is allowed through your firewall for each ESX device you want to connect to.\n\nIn case of a stand-alone ESX(i), a private IP can be used, but the port(s) needs to be forwarded in a similar manner (E.g. if your ESX has IP address 192.168.1.100 and your Internet-facing IP address is say 1.2.3.4, you need to make sure both the SSL port (443) and the VNC ports used (5900-5909) are being forwarded to the *same* IP address - 1.2.3.4:443 -> 192.168.1.100:443 and 1.2.3.4:(5900-5909) -> 192.168.1.100:(5900-5909).\n\nFurthermore, please make note of the fact that only the 8-character password is encrypted with the standard VNC client. All VNC client traffic is sent unencrypted across the network. If security is a concern in your organization, you need to be aware of this. You can disable your VNC terminal once you are done with the Console session (use Configure Console and disable VNC altogether).\n\nVMWare Tools needs to be installed on each and every VM that is monitored through iVMControl's console connection. Check the Vmware knowledge base on other requirements:\n\nhttp://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1246\nMake sure you enable gdbserver through the FW, e.g.\nhttps://www.unixarena.com/2014/02/configuring-vmware-esxi-virtual-machine-console-vnc.html/\n\nUsage:\n- Single click, pan and zoom are standard as any iPhone application\n- Tap with two fingers for right click\n- Ctrl-Alt-Del button sends a Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence to the VM\n- Keyboard button will raise/lower the keyboard.\n\n** NOTE ** VMware decided to offer read-only access to the management APIs for the *FREE* version of ESXi. This applies to all management applications, and is enforced by VMware. What this means for iVMControl is that if you have a FREE ESXi, you will be able to use only the 'read-only' (monitoring) functions of iVMControl."

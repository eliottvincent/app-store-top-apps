      "label": "iCurrencyPad is not just a simple and elegant currency convertor and calculator. \n\niCurrencyPad also offers an up-to-the-minute exchange rates \"electronic board\", detailed charts of historical price trends, and more:\n\n √  a polished, easy-to-use interface \n √  160+ currencies from around the world \n √  favorite currencies to reduce clutter \n √  charts for all exchange rates \n √  multiple data sources\n \n √   iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch resolutions\n √  HD Retina graphics optimized for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Excellent! Professional! Highly Recommended... finally the currency application I have been waiting for so long...\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"...I tried all other similar apps, and I am proud to announce that this app is simply the best of them all..\"\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ \"Smart, intuitive and flexible!... slick interface with great functionality which further impresses with its great selection of currencies and immediate updates. Good job! Highly recommend!\"\n\nFeatures:\n\n-- Simple Interface -- \niCurrencyPad was designed to be fast and easy to use. Just select the currencies to convert and tap in the amount to convert. A convenient calculator allows for basic math calculations, showing the results as the values are tapped. Swipe across the display to swap the left and right currencies, or swipe up and down to select different currencies. Tap and hold to copy/paste. \n\n-- Favorite Currencies -- \nWhile iCurrencyPad offers exchange rates for 160+ currencies from around the world, you may be interested in only a few currencies. To reduce clutter on the screen, iCurrencyPad allows you to select and sort your Favorite Currencies, so only those currencies that interest you appear on the screen, thereby making the application easier and faster to use. \n\n-- Charts -- \nDetailed charts show the history of exchange rates for any two currencies. Tap on the chart for the exchange rate on any particular day. Tap with two fingers to show the change in rates between any two dates. Rotate the device for a larger chart in landscape view. Charts for most currencies are available for 1-day, 5-days, 3-months, 6-months, 1-year, 2-years, 5-years and 10-years. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Listing -- \nThe exchange rates listing shows a base currency compared to all other currencies, similar to the electronic exchange rate boards seen in \"Change\" shops around the world. \n\n-- Exchange Rates Updates -- \niCurrencyPad updates Exchange Rates on demand, or automatically at pre-defined intervals ranging from 15 seconds to 1 day. Exchange Rates are automatically updated when the app is launched, or auto-updates can be turned off when roaming. An Internet connection is required to update rates, either via cellular network or a Wifi connection. Without a connection, rates can still be accessed and converted using the last data downloaded. \n\n-- Easy to Get Started -- \nA short 20-second tutorial will play when you first launch iCurrencyPad and guide you through the app's features. \n\n-- Languages -- \nThe user interface is offered in 9 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Please visit the App Store in your language for a translated description and screenshots.\n\n-- Reviews -- \n\"...iCurrency Pad is a great piece of software powered by a stunning design and usability. It’s beautiful, useful, powerful yet simple and straightforward...\" \n\n-- MacStories (http://bit.ly/94Y9IT)"

Non financial data, such as the change in mileage and average fuel consumption can also be calculated, and displayed in brief or in detail. \n\nA carbon footprint can also be calculated, depending on the consumption of the vehicle, as well as the mass of carbon dioxide (CO2) it produces (total and average per day and per mile traveled). \n\nCar Manager also allows all these data (costs, fill-ups, vehicle information) to be exported and sent by e-mail directly from your iPhone as a CSV file (comma separated values, which can opened and processed by Excel or any other spreadsheet program), should you feel the need to create your own personalized statistics. \n\nThe application also enables you to manage a directory containing all the information about the service providers for your vehicles: insurance companies, garages, stores, clubs, associations, etc. You can then easily locate them thanks to the Maps interface. \n\nCar Manager also provides you with a Tools section, which allows you to geolocate your current position or your parking spot in a single click, so you can easily go back there later with the integrated GPS visual guiding function (or with Maps directions). This tools section can also help you find various services around your location: gas stations, garages, restaurants, hotels and others. \n\nCar Manager also gives you the opportunity to stay tuned to car news: it comes with a number of RSS feeds (internet information channels) allowing you to be informed of anything related to cars and motorsports. You can of course add any RSS feed you want. \n\nThe application automatically adapts itself to the units of measurement effective in your country: kilometers or miles for distances, liters or gallons for fuel. \n\niOS 7.1 or higher. \nUniversal application with full resolution support for iPad"

Within seconds, you will be able to calculate the monthly payment for different types of fixed rate loans such as home mortgage, auto, and credit card.  You can calculate \"what if\" scenarios to determine how additional monthly and yearly payment will help you to pay off your loan earlier and save money in interest.  In addition, you can use Loan Calculator Pro to track all your extra payments at any amount and at any point in the life of your loan.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Early Payment Simulation\nSee how much interest you will save and how early you will pay off your loan by entering extra payment amounts per month and/or per year.\n\n* Extra Payment Tracking\n- Loan Calculator Pro will let you track all of your extra payments in variable amounts throughout the life of the loan.  For example, it will let you track an extra $100 in principle on the first payment, an extra $300 on the 5th payment, and an extra $1000 one the 10th payment, etc.  This way, the application will still be useful long after you have purchased your property and will let your know exactly where you are with all your loan payments.\n\n* Fast Calculations\n- Loan Calculator Pro is designed to be fast.  Calculations are done instantly after you enter each amount field.\n\n* Large Numeric Keypad\n- The large keypad allows for easier, faster, and more accurate entry of numeric amounts.\n\n* Amortization Table\n- A complete payment schedule allows you to view the amount, interest, principal, and remaining balance for each and every payment of the loan.\n\n* Bookmark of Payments\n- You can bookmark the current payment you are at in the amortization table and the application automatically scroll to the memorized payment the next time.\n\n* Saved Loans\n- Loan Calculator Pro lets you save and organize all your various loans in a list so you do not have to enter the information over each time.  It will also remember and opens up the last saved loan you worked on.\n\n* Loan List Reordering\n- You can reorder the loans from the saved list in any order you choose.\n\n* Email Export\n- Export loan information and payment schedule via email.\n\n* Passcode Security\n- Passcode protection to keep your loan information private.\n\n* Backup / Restore\n- Backup your data to your computer for safekeeping.  Then restore it to your iOS device when you need to via the iTunes file sharing interface.\n\n* Intuitive User Interface\n- Special attention was given to the user interface to ensure that it is clean, intuitive, and easy to use."

      "label": "Whether you're a business or leisure traveler, hopping from country to country is a breeze when you have Currency+ in your hands!  This Universal currency conversion application for the iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch shows you what you're paying instantly and is easy to use even when you have jet lag.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Currency Calculator\n- Apple Watch Support\n- Today Widget\n- Support For Over 150 World Currencies, Precious Metals & Bitcoin\n- Historical Charts\n- Trend Analysis\n- Background Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\n- Editable Calculator Tape\n- Inverse Currency Calculations\n- Transaction Fees or Taxes\n- 100% Ad Free\n\nWhat Makes Currency+ stand out from other Currency Apps?\n\nCurrency Calculator\nWhen you are traveling in a different country, most of the time your focus will be on converting the local currency back to your home currency. The built in calculator lets you focus on two selected currencies on one screen. The built in calculator remains on the screen at all times making data entry quick and easy.\n\nApple Watch\nUse Currency+ on the Apple Watch. See your favorites currency list and your Currency Alerts directly on the watch.\n\nToday Widget\nUse the Today Widget to quickly see the conversion rates between all your favorite currencies. Tap the rate to reverse the conversion. Tap any of the currencies on the list to set as the base currency.\n\nSupport For Over 150 World Currencies & Precious Metals\nFor times where you want to keep track of many currencies at one time, the favorites list is where you need to go. You pick from  over150 world currencies and precious metals (powered by Yahoo.com). Selecting any currency in your list, enter a value and the rest of the currencies in your list will show you that amount in their own currency in real time.\n\nHistorical Charts\nCurrency+ has historical charts. You can view historical currency conversion charts for any two currencies. Touch the chart with a single finger to see data from any period in the past. Touch the chart with two fingers to compare currency exchange rates from any two past periods. Show charts for 1 day (real time intraday), 5day, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years.\n\nCurrency Trends\nWith Trends, you can select any of the 150+ world currencies and compare it to a list of other currencies to see how it has performed over time. See if your currency has strengthened or weakened. Select your time period from days to years. Export your work to an email, text, note, etc using the trend share sheet.\n\nBackground Rate Updates & Currency Alerts\nCurrency+ will go out and update your currency rates without taking your device out of your pocket. Whenever you open Currency+, your data will always be up to date. Do you want to be notified when a currency goes above or below a certain value? If so, Currency+ can notify you of these changes without the need to open the app. You will receive a push notification on your device whenever the currency you are watching goes beyond the limit you set.\n\nEditable Calculator Tape\nCurrency+ has an integrated calculator tape that keeps track of everything that you do. You can send any value from the tap to any of your favorite currencies. You can edit/delete/insert tape values and your calculations will automatically update. Finally, you can put comments on any of your tape values to help you keep track of what your numbers stand for.\n\nInverse Currency Calculations\nNeed to do inverse or reverse currency calculations? Currency+ can switch between standard and inverse currency conversion modes on the fly.\n\nTransaction Fees or Taxes\nCurrency+ can factor in transaction fees (or tax) automatically. Individuals rarely convert money at published exchange rates - most banks and exchange offices charge a fee. Enter the transaction fee percentage to give you a better estimate of your 'real' conversion rates.\n\nMake the leap with Jump Gap Software's Currency+, the currency converter that takes you around the world and back."

      "label": "Rated 5 stars and loved by thousands of users!\nUnlike traditional complicated budgeting apps, Daily Budget Original focuses on being simple, easy and actually fun to use.\n\nThis PRO version includes all paid features of the free version (yellow icon). \n\n-- SAFE & PRIVATE –-\nThe app does not connect to bank accounts, so there is no need to enter your online banking log in data.\nAlso, we do not sell user data.  The data stays on your device only.  If you want to sync your data, you can encrypt it before uploading it to the cloud.\n\n-- USER REVIEWS –-\nBeyond spectacular! - This app is so fantastic- as with many other reviewers, I've tried other budgeting apps like Mint. But this is the only app that actually works. It incentives me to spend less money on some days, have extra to spend on the weekends. Thank you for not adding too many bells and whistles!\n\nLife Changing - I am the WORST with finances and I've tried other apps, including Mint, which I used for a week and quit. But this app??

      "label": "Account Book is an app which helps you to control your finances. Who doesn't know that feeling of having less and less money in your account at the end of the month eventhough you haven't bought anything special? This is where keeping a household account book comes in handy. But how many actually do this? Sitting down every day and detailing your exact spending only to find that at the end of the month your bank account still shows the same deficit as before. \n\nThis app will help you to order your finances in an easy way. Due to the clear and simple layout, you can enter your daily expenses and incomes in only a few seconds. \n\nInitially, it is advisable to enter your monthly fixed costs (e.g. rent) and income (e.g. salary) to have them calculated as a flat rate by this clever app. This way you don't have to deduct your rent every month or add your salary...but rather this is done for you automatically. This app can automatically deduct or add a fixed amount monthly or annually, so you are spared a lot of work. \n\nSimply enter your flexible expenses each time and add a short commentary if you like. So if, for example, you go shopping simply enter that you spent € 20 at the shops. The date is then automatically added and your expense is booked. \n\nNext time you go shopping, you don't have to type in \"Shopping\" as this item will be suggested to you automatically. Simply add the amount you spent. \n\nOf course, this system works the other way round as well. When you have income, for example you sell your old television on Ebay and earn € 50, you can book that amount in just a few seconds and this way never lose overview of your finances. \n\nSo you don't lose the complete overview however, you can also have graphically displayed in which month you had a positive or negative balance. This way you can oversee the whole year and determine when you spent a lot and on what you spent your money on.  \n\nTo recognize in advance when it could become difficult at the end of a month again, it is displayed to you what percentage of the month still remains and how much money you have at your disposal. This way you know in advance, for example, that you still have half the month to go but only have € 200 to spend. Therefore, start saving! \n\nThis app is an investment which pays for itself on day one and turns into profit after that. \n\nAdditionally, it should be mentioned that studies have proven that people who use (household) account books handle their money more consciously and end up with more money at the end of the month than people who do not. This is mainly explained by those people asking themselves if they really need that € 2 packet of chewing gum or if it is simply a pointless expense which will haunt them at the end of the month."

It calculates the compound interest which means it assumes you reinvest the interest after each year (or just leave it in the bank account). So you will profit from the interest you earn on interest you already got.\n\nYou can calculate any value in the interest equations, so that you can find out how much interest rate or how many years are necessary to reach a certain goal. As well you can find out how much money you need to start with. This is perfect for doing \"what-if\" analysis."

MathU RPN is based on the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) entry system and combines more than 96 functions to create a calculator that meets the needs of professionals who use a calculator every day.\n\nDr. Clay M. Thompson of Creative Creek has harnessed the computational power of the iPhone to produce an accurate and high performance calculator.\n\nGeneral Features\n- IEEE double precision accuracy (16 digits)\n- High performance fast computations\n- 20 storage registers\n- 5 financial registers\n- 16 high stack (switchable to 4)\n- Supports international number separators\n- Switch between portrait and landscape keypads\n- Quick access to the preference and on-line manual\n- Stack and Register view (accessible via [RCL][RCL]\n\nScientific Features\n- Full set of trigonometric functions\n- Full set of logarithmic and power functions\n- Statistics functions\n- Polar and rectangular conversions\n- Repeated computations\n\nMortgage and Loan Features\n- Time value of Money functions\n- Compute mortgage and loan terms\n- Solve for payments and interest rates\n- Solve for IRR and NPV\n- Date functions\n\nComputer Science Features\n- Number bases (HEX, OCT, DEC, BIN)\n- Bitwise logical operations\n- Masking and shifting functions\n- Support for a wordsizes up to 48 bits\n- Modular arithmetic\n\nMathU RPN 3.2 has been reformatted to work on the iPhone and iPad.  On the iPad, MathU RPN maintains its orientation as the iPad is turned.\n\nMathU RPN 3.2 a great programmer's calculator.  The A-F keys are available right up front for easy entry in HEX mode and there are many functions for working with integers.\n\nMathU RPN 3.2 is also a better financial calculator.  There are new functions for computing mortgage amortization and cash flow computations like IRR and NPV, as well as functions for working with dates.  Many of the existing financial functions have been extended to handle odd periods (conforming to the same conventions as the HP-12C).  In addition, on tall devices (like the iPhone 5 or higher), the financial registers are displayed on the keypad.\n\nThe scientific side of MathU RPN has also been improved by adding functions for linear regression as well as computing the percent of total.\n\nMathU 3.2 supports iOS 9.3 or higher.\n\nFor more info (including the users manual)\ngo to http://www.creativecreek.com or use the built-in quick reference."

The calculator provides a quick overview of the overall cost, the repayment to interest ratio, as well as a payment plan covering the complete term of the loan. No matter whether you want to finance a car or a house, MobileLoan Calculator will let you evaluate offers or manage existing loans. Try it for yourself!\n\nDeclaration of independency: \n\nwe are not dependent on any sponsors, included but not limited to banks, credit institutions or other financial service providers. We do not send any of the calculations or any other data to anybody, give e-mail addresses to anybody away, send unsolicited messages. \n\nCalculate:\n\n* Loan Amount: if you know how much money you need, or if you want to evaluate the target loan amount you can afford.\n* Nominal interest: what interest rate is the basis for the finance plan? How much more would be affordable?\n* Annuity/Payment: how much must you pay for this loan depending on the type of payment? Can you afford it?\n* Term: how long will you repay this loan under the given conditions?\n* Residual debt: how much will you still owe by the end of the finance plan?\n\nCalculate by using:\n\n* Payment method: semi-monthly, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, tri-annually, semi-annually and yearly.\n* Interest method: US (nominal interest rate = relative periodic interest calculation) or ICMA (effective interest rate = compounded periodic interest calculation)\n* A grace period (period without repayments)\n* Unscheduled repayments: unlimited, non-recurring and/or recurring, constant or relative to loan values.\n* Costs: unlimited, non-recurring and/or recurring, including points or account fees, constant or relative to loan values.\n\nThe clean layout provides an at-a-glance assessment of the economic viability of a loan, helps compare it with alternatives, and allows for easy data entry and management of loan characteristics.\n\nHistory: automatically saves all calculations (customize the number of steps to save). All values are only a click away and instantly reusable.\n\nFavorites: unlimited number of predefined calculations for later review and/or edits.\n\nOnce the calculation is successfully completed, you obtain a finance plan with the complete progression, the effective interest rate, the sum of all payments, plus some additional information, including the amount of residual debt after half of the agreed term, the amount of time left until half the loan is payed back, as well as a graphical view.\n\nMobileLoan Calculator features PDF and CSV export (with customizable delimiters) via e-mail as well as printing the loan data and payment plan on compatible printers.\n\nMobileLoan Calculator was designed based upon recognized financial mathematical rules, and calculates fast and reliably. \n\nWe value your feedback! It can influence the direction of further development as well as the priority given to each feature.\n\nNote: all results without warranty! No guarantee is given in any way; no warranty for failed or erroneous business transactions. Our years of experience have shown that banks do not always calculate 100% correctly from a mathematical standpoint, although they are right from a commercial standpoint."

      "label": "More than 30 years ago we saw the birth of the most popular financial calculator ever created--you probably had one (and probably still do!).\n\nCalculator12 puts a rock solid emulation of that calculator on your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, whether you need it for school or are looking to retire old faithful. What you get is true (albeit non-programmable) emulation with 100% compatible operation keystroke for screentap and computational and operational reliability every bit as good as the original.\n\nBut wait, there's more! (sorry about that). Calculator12 is not stuck in the 80s. You have the option to work with cash flows in the cash flow diagram format, changing values or inserting/deleting cash flows with just a tap. Three independent cash flow scenarios can be evaluated side-by-side, and with capital multiplication you can evaluate an exit strategy for outside investors. Results can be emailed from Calculator12 so you don't have to redo things like an amortization schedule or comparative investment report at your lap or desktop. \n\nAnd you can see what was once hidden... the contents of the financial registers or optionally the stack are always displayed. For me at least confirming the accuracy of my entries relieves a lot of anxiety and prevents confusion when the results don't stack up. It's not programmable, but advance payment leasing functions have been pre-programmed in as well as conversions to APR and Effective Rate to fill some of the gaps. And it is blisteringly fast--what used to take 30 seconds now is done almost before your finger leaves the touchscreen. \n\nCalculator12 was the very first emulator of that physical machine on the App Store, v1.0 released July 30th of 2008, introducing features (now almost universally copied) that take advantage of the unique features of iOS to improve your ability to deal with financial problem solving. There are lots of emulators now, but only one that has moved out of the 80s. (this one!)\n\n*** This application listing provides an upgrade path for early adopters to the redesigned and renamed Calc-12E. It is identical to Calc-12E and is maintained on the App Store to provide a way for existing customers to upgrade their original purchase to Calc-12E free-of-charge... It will appear on your home screen as Calc12E***"

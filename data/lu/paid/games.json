      "label": "***** MARCH UPDATE *****\n20 new puzzles, 100 puzzles total!\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nPresented by Cracking The Cryptic, YouTube’s most popular Sudoku channel, comes a new game featuring one of the most popular puzzle types: Thermo Sudoku.\n\nHow does Thermo Sudoku work? Well each sudoku grid contains thermometer shapes (often drawn to create themes) and digits on thermometers must increase as one moves further from the bulb end. The interactions between the thermometers leads to new logical ideas and patterns that completely refreshes the standard sudoku solving experience.\n\nAs with their other games (‘Classic Sudoku’, ‘Sandwich Sudoku’ and ‘Chess Sudoku’), Simon Anthony and Mark Goodliffe (the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic) have personally crafted the hints for the puzzles. So you know that every puzzle has been play-tested by a human being to ensure that the sudoku is interesting and fun to solve.\n\nIn Cracking The Cryptic’s games, players start with zero stars and earn stars by solving puzzles. The more puzzles you solve, the more stars you earn and the more puzzles you get to play. Only the most dedicated (and cleverest) sudoku players will finish all the puzzles. Of course the difficulty is carefully calibrated to ensure lots of puzzles at every level (from easy through to extreme). Anyone familiar with their YouTube channel will know that Simon and Mark take pride in teaching viewers to be better solvers and, in these games, they always craft the puzzles with the mindset of trying to help solvers improve their skills.\n\nMark and Simon have both represented the UK many times at the World Sudoku Championship and you can find more of their puzzles (and lots of others) on the internet’s biggest sudoku channel Cracking The Cryptic.\n\nFeatures:\n100 beautiful puzzles\nHints crafted by Simon and Mark!"

      "label": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Interface and audio in English. Subtitles in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified), Korean.\n\n#MadeWithFusion"

Play solo to improve your best score, or challenge players from all over the world!\n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nEach round you will have to roll the dice and use the available routes to build your transportation network and connect as many exits as possible. Expand your network to collect points.

      "label": "InfiniteCorp is a decision-based strategy card game set in a fictional cyberpunk world. You are an employee of a corporation dealing in goods distribution and logistics in the “Mega Tower” – the place where all local citizens live. Join a world where the stakes are high, and morality is blurred.\n\nDiscover a cyberpunk world with a vibrant vision of the future.\nThe technology in this cyberpunk world has reached the highest level of advancement and all\rkinds of cyber-implants and genetic modifications are commonplace. Most people have not\rseen living, natural plants or animals. Life for the citizens of an independent city-state founded\rin the middle of the ocean – “Babylon 6” – depends on your decisions.\n\nEach decision you make could have unfortunate consequences. \nThe world is in your hands. Choose the right strategy and make the right decisions. There are\rmany choices – each has a definite impact on citizens’ lives. Make sure that “megacorporations”\rmaintain an influence on the world’s operation and the lives of citizens.\rCorporations deal with specific fields and want to earn the highest possible profit. They do not\rcare about their customers or their employees.\n\nUnpredictable requests from the people will shape your future. \nEach week of your career brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable city as you strive for a balance between the elites, the citizens, the media, criminal overlords, and the security. How will you treat the sick and wounded? You just need to know what side you're on.\n\nStrive for balance between different social groups.\nThe tower is divided into floors, and the floors into districts. One district is large enough to\rhave all the facilities needed for proper citizen maintenance and functioning. The division of\rfloors is also a division of social classes – the higher you live, the higher you are in the local\rhierarchy.\n\nFAQs and suggestions:\n• How do you play?\nHold down on the card and swipe it slowly left or right so you can check the two possible\roptions. Decide what choice you want to make, keeping in mind the four statistics. Don’t\rforget: every choice you make will have future consequences.\n• Does the game always start with the same set of cards?\nEach loss will restart the game with slightly different cards, but the goal remains the\rsame.\n\nSupported Languages: English, Polish\nMore languages should be available soon!"

Water, Oil, and Lava fall from Droppers and bounce around the walls of the puzzle. You move and rotate various types of bumpers, sliders, accelerators, and sponges in order to divert the flow of the falling droplets. The faster you complete each of the 50 levels, the more bonus points you receive.\n\nThe physics in Enigmo are truly amazing to watch!  This is one of the most unique puzzle games ever created.\n\nIn addition to the 50 levels that come with the game, you can also download many more levels for free!  As of version 1.1, you can download levels created by other users or by yourself with the Mac or PC version of Enigmo which has a built-in level editor.  You may submit your levels to us and we'll include them in the public list if we like them enough.\n\n_______________\n\nWatch the behind the scenes video:  http://pangeasoft.net/iphone/behindthescenes.html"

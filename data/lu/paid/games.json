Um den Hauptpreis (Millionen virtuelle Euros) pro Spiel zu gewinnen, musst du 15 Fragen aus unterschiedlichen Wissensbereichen und in verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsgraden richtig beantworten. \n\nWenn du erfolgreich bist, werden die gewonnenen Punkte in einer virtuellen Spielbank verwaltet. Bei einer falschen Antwort hast du verloren und dein virtuelles Spielkonto wird angepasst. Um den größten Gewinn zu erzielen, kannst du deine eigene Spielstrategie auswählen. \n\nWenn dir die richtige Antwort nicht sofort einfällt, dann kannst du 4 Antworthilfen nutzen bzw. du nimmst das Spielgeld oder du rätst einfach auf gut Glück. Zur Diskussion steht immer die Freie Enzyklopädie „Wikipedia“. \n\nDas Spiel hat drei Schwierigkeitsgrade: leicht, mittel und schwer. Ein virtueller Millionär pro Spiel kannst du allerdings nur im Schwierigkeitsgrad \"schwer\" werden.\n \nDie Fragen aus unserer Datenbank decken Schul-, Allgemein- und sogar Spezialwissen auf höherem Level ab. Stell dein Wissen bei folgenden Themen unter Beweis: Film, Geschichte, Literatur, Tierwelt, Musik, Reisen, Mathematik, Landeskunde, Politik, Geographie, Kunst, Physik und viele andere mehr. \n\nDeine eigenen Quiz-Fragen bzw. Verbesserungen zu bestehenden Fragen kannst du bequem über die App an uns schicken. Wir werden sie gerne prüfen und gegebenenfalls mit dem nächsten Update veröffentlichen. \n\n\n----- Besonderheiten unseres Spiels ----- \n\n1. 15.000 Fragen in der Datenbank. (Es finden ständige Fragen-Updates statt, die aus unserer weitläufigen Community kommen). Ein Dankeschön an alle, die so engagiert waren und ihren Beitrag dazu geleistet haben! \n \n2. Virtueller Albert Einstein mit Zitaten aus berühmten Filmen und Werken der Literatur. \n\n3. Drei Schwierigkeitsgrade des Spiels (leicht, mittel und schwer) \n\n4. Eingestellter Timer oder Spiel ohne Zeitbegrenzung \n\n5. Virtuelle Geldbank für leidenschaftliche Spieler (unterschiedliche Spielernamen) \n\n6. Antworthilfen mit lustigen Animationen \n\n7. Spiel am TV (Apple TV), wenn ein größerer Freundeskreis dabei ist \n\n8. Geschwindigkeitssteuerung aller Spiel-Animationen \n\n9. Die Möglichkeit, uns eigene Fragen zukommen zu lassen (werden nach Prüfung eingebaut) \n\n10. Die Möglichkeit, fehlerhafte oder irreführende Fragen an uns zu melden.

      "label": "\"Did you know that “Schadenfreude” is a German word defined as the concept of finding joy in someone else’s misfortune? It is also the main idea on which Neighbours back From Hell is built. A whole TV show based on playing increasingly outrageous pranks on your grumpy neighbor to keep the audience entertained, and viewership numbers high. It’s good to be bad in this early 2000s trash TV-inspired slapstick extravaganza! \n\nAs Woody, the vengeful star protagonist of Neighbours back From Hell, you will prank your way through Seasons 1 and 2 of the fictitious, but aptly named TV show. Take the mischief from your nasty neighbor’s flat all the way to China, India, and Mexico where you will make sure his holiday is a living hell. While you’re at it, why limit targeting your antics at your neighbor, when you can involve his mother and fellow travelers? Whatever you decide to do, your trusty camera crew will be right there and keep a keen eye on all the action. You can let your crooked creativity flow freely and watch the neighbor rage in desperation. Just be mindful not to get caught by him or his companions, or they will whoop you good and your TV show will be taken off the air. If you perform well on the other hand, by creating more and more disarray and chaos in the neighbor’s life, ratings will increase, and you could win prestigious awards. \"\n\nNeighbours From Hell 1 & 2 Remastered in one package: 28 episodes set in the neighbor’s home, on a cruise liner, and in several different holiday locations around the world \n\n- All graphics newly rendered in Full HD \n- Framerate of all animations doubled for a smoother experience  \n- Use stealth, skill, and style to perform the perfect ambush \n- Easy to use interface and controls \n- Superb cartoon-style graphics \n- Big band soundtrack \n- Game Center support\r\n- Full controller support\n\n© HandyGames"

Water, Oil, and Lava fall from Droppers and bounce around the walls of the puzzle. You move and rotate various types of bumpers, sliders, accelerators, and sponges in order to divert the flow of the falling droplets. The faster you complete each of the 50 levels, the more bonus points you receive.\n\nThe physics in Enigmo are truly amazing to watch!  This is one of the most unique puzzle games ever created.\n\nIn addition to the 50 levels that come with the game, you can also download many more levels for free!  As of version 1.1, you can download levels created by other users or by yourself with the Mac or PC version of Enigmo which has a built-in level editor.

During verification, select the “Call me” option to receive the code over a phone call.\n\n• RUN BOTH WHATSAPP MESSENGER AND WHATSAPP BUSINESS: You can use both WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Messenger on the same phone, but each app must have its own unique phone number.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can more efficiently respond to your customers right from your computer's browser.\n\nWhatsApp Business is built on top of WhatsApp Messenger and includes all the features that you rely on, such as the ability to send multimedia, free calls*, free international messaging*, group chat, offline messages, and much more.\n\n*Data charges may apply.

The dynamic between the “normal” web-based version of Shopify, and the mobile app, is amazing, with little to no changes (Except the size being scaled down of course.)“\n(Source: https://ecommercenewshq.com/the-complete-shopify-mobile-app-review/)\n\nReview from David B via g2.com\n“Shopify [..] allows me to do important things for my store from anywhere. That is because it gives me advantages in managing the store from a mobile device.”\n(Source: https://www.g2.com/products/shopify/reviews/shopify-review-2822877)\n\nABOUT SHOPIFY\nShopify’s ecommerce app can keep your business moving quickly. In the fast-paced world of ecommerce, that speed can be the difference between a sale for you or for your competitor.  \n\nShopify has everything you need to start selling online, for any ecommerce business.

When you call or text customers in the app, they see your business phone number. When they call or text you, it's clear what's a business call, so you can choose when to work, when to relax, and always sound great to customers.\n\nGet started with calls and text in as quick as one minute (yes really!)

You can even automatically play one voicemail message when you're open, and another when you're closed.\n\nVOICEMAIL TO TEXT\n\nEasily see everything about a customer in one screen, including missed calls, voicemails, and a transcription of the voicemail for easy reference.\n\nPORT OR CHOOSE YOUR NUMBER\n\nChoose a local area code, a toll-free number, or port your existing business phone number from a VoIP phone service, google phone, or landline service. You can then customize your line to fit your business. This includes setting your availability, voicemail, greeting message, and more.\n\nINCREDIBLY FAST SETUP\n\nGet started calling from a custom business phone number in under a minute. Just download the app, pick a number, and start calling/texting!\n\nMULTIPLE PHONE NUMBERS\n\nHave multiple lines, multiple businesses, or just want more numbers?

One click in your Tempo-Team account is all it takes. And from the comfort of your own home! Do you already have a job through us? In that case, you can take care of all your work-related matters with this app.\n\nOK, but what kind of jobs are we talking about here? Where will I find a job?\n\n* Well, how about a job in logistics, healthcare, cleaning or customer service? A technical job, or working for the government? But we also have administrative jobs and jobs in the hospitality industry for you!\n* Are you looking for a part time job, or do you want to work full time? A temporary job, an after-school job or a permanent job? We’ve got it all! \n* Look for Tempo-Team Go in the app if you want a short gig - you can decide when and where you want to work. Pretty good, right?\n\nI’d like to apply for a job. How does this work?\n\n* It’s amazingly easy to create an account in the app. You will need this account to apply for a job.\n* Is this the first time you’re applying for a job? No problem! We will ask some extra details about you. We’ll save them straight away so you don’t need to fill them out again when you apply next time. It saves time ;) and afterwards you can apply with just 1 click!\n* Do you prefer to apply for jobs using your laptop, or have you seen a dream job that’s perfect for a friend? Just forward it! All you need to do is share the link to the job.\n\nAnd what else can I do with the app?\n\n* The app is high on our list of priorities. In other words, we regularly introduce improvements to make your life easier! For example, if you save a job on your computer, you’ll see it in the app too! Pretty nice, right? \n* So, you’ve found a job through Tempo-Team? Well done! You can still use the app. You see, it’s very convenient for keeping your work records: you can accept shifts for your schedule, register your working hours and check your pay slip!\n\nIs the app acting up?

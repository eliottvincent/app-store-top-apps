From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

The depth of our courses combined with the latest research in machine learning gets you using a language with high proficiency, fast.\n\nGET LEVEL PLACED FOR FREE - TRY LINGVIST\n\nLEARN 10 LANGUAGES: English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Estonian and Russian.\n\n=====\n\nWHY LINGVIST?\n\nFOLLOW CONVERSATIONS QUICKLY\nLearn the vocabulary that appears most often in a language first, allowing you to accelerate your learning.\n\nREAD, WRITE, SPEAK, AND LISTEN\nPerfect your pronunciation using sophisticated speech recognition technology or type your answers. Every sentence has audio to ensure you hone your listening skills.\n\nFOR SERIOUS LEARNERS\nYour learning efficiency is our focus. Enjoy a clean UI with no advertising, no unnecessary clicks, and no distractions.\n\nREMEMBER A LANGUAGE FOREVER\nUsing scientifically proven spaced repetition methodology, the vocabulary gets fixed in your long-term memory over time. You can even see your progress on increasing the intervals in the app.\n\nLEARN GRAMMAR IN CONTEXT OR AS A FOCUS\nAcquire grammar passively (inductive learning) like a native with our bite-sized sentences, or practice conjugating French verbs in our French course.\n\nSPECIALIST VOCABULARY FOR YOU\nSubmit your own words, images, or text and Lingvist will automatically gather vocabulary related to the theme for you to learn. Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language? Lingvist works best when used in parallel with other learning methods. It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer. Each subscription will be automatically renewed unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current payment period.

Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

      "label": "The Arduino Science Journal (formerly Science Journal, an initiative by Google) is free and allows you to gather data about the world around you by harnessing the sensors in your smartphone as well as sensors connected to Arduino. The Science Journal transforms smartphones and tablets into science notebooks that encourage students to explore their world.\n\nThe Arduino Science Journal app is recommended for students from 10 to 18 years of age.\n\nAbout Arduino Science Journal\nWith the Arduino Science Journal, you can learn interactively, conduct experiments and iterate on findings.\n\n•  Enhance your existing lesson plans: use the Science Journal with activities and assignments you have already prepared\n•  Classroom & home-school friendly: you don’t have to be in a classroom setting to start exploring. The Arduino Science Journal can be used to run experiments straight away, as long as you have your smartphone or tablet with you! \n•  Move learning outside: the use of mobile devices along with the types of experiments we offer encourage students to get out of their seats and open their eyes to the world around them through the power of science\n•  Science and data have no secrets: you can easily record your observations, store your data sensors in real-time and analyse them, just as a proper scientist! \n•  Connect the digital and the physical world from your pocket: go through a series of simple tutorials and start having fun with science\n\nWith built-in device sensors as well as external hardware, you can measure light, sound, movement, and much more.  You can also compare results, and even set triggers. \n\nTogether with the external hardware, (not included with the app), students are enabled to conduct more complex experiments, and advance in their scientific studies. As long as the external sensors are compatible with a Bluetooth-connecting device such as a microcontroller, there is no end to what experiments the students can make. Some popular sensors that the app can work with are: light, conductivity, temperature, force, gas, heart rate, respiration, radiation, pressure, magnetism, and many more.\n\nThe app is classroom-friendly, since students can sign in on any device and access their experiments to continue exploring the world, wherever they are!\n\nIf you’re an educator with a Google Classroom account, you can also subscribe to the Teacher Plan, which allows you to integrate the app with Google Classroom and share this integration with your students. You can then create assignments, templates, and experiments in the app and import existing classes from Google Classroom.\n\nPermissions notice:\n\n• Bluetooth: needed to scan for Bluetooth sensor devices.\n• Camera: needed to take pictures to document experiments and for the brightness sensor.\n• Photo Library: needed to store pictures taken to document experiments and for adding existing photos from your library to experiments.\n• Microphone: needed for sound intensity sensor.\n• Push notifications: needed to inform you of recording status when backgrounding the app.\n\nBenefits of using the Arduino Science Journal\n• It’s free and simple to use\n• Easy setup: download the app and start exploring with your phone’s built-in sensors\n• Cross-platform support\n• Portable: enhance your home learning or bring your device outside to study the world around you\n• Safe for children to use: COPPA Compliance underway \n• Fully compatible with Arduino hardware: keep experimenting with the Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab, as well as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board\n• Google Drive integration, as well as local download\n\n---\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.arduino.cc/en/sj-terms-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy\nChildren's Privacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/children-privacy-policy"

      "label": "«Барбоскины на даче учат таблицу умножения» – это веселая и полезная игра – математика для детей. Проверенный метод обучения поможет запомнить таблицу умножения легко, быстро и навсегда.\r\n\r\nВ детском приложении – тренажере таблицы умножения – обучение идёт в удобной для запоминания форме от простого к сложному, от сложения к умножению. Осваивая навык умножения, дети получают игровые призы. Игра с любимыми героями Барбоскиными отлично мотивирует ребенка, и он движется от одного успешно выполненного блока к другому.\r\nЗадания нацелены на лёгкое запоминание результатов умножения чисел от 1 до 10. Этот метод обучения математике рекомендован учителями начальных классов и опробован в десятках московских школ.\r\nСюжет игры основан на мультике «Барбоскины на даче». Барбоскины – весёлое семейство собак – отправляются на летние каникулы на дачу. Малыш находит себе новых друзей – Котов и охотно включается с ними в игру, не зная, что они скрывают свои истинные намерения! Артистичная Лиза и красотка Роза легко обведут Котов вокруг пальца. Вместе с любимыми персонажами дети получают новые знания и закрепляют их в увлекательных мини-играх:\r\n- «Лучник». Помоги Малышу выбрать правильную мишень, играя в индейцев.\r\n- «Рыбалка». Вместе с Дружком поймай самую крупную рыбу. \r\n- «Шарики». Налови Розе для праздника много воздушных шаров.\r\n- «Лайки». Проверь, чьи фотокарточки собрали больше лайков. \r\n- «Химик». Помоги Гене в его научных экспериментах. \r\nПроходи мини-игры и тренажеры и помогай Гене собрать его научный проект! Прокачивай знания и навыки, и кто знает, может, ему удастся получить Нобелевскую премию?\r\nОсобенности игры «Барбоскины на даче. Таблица умножения»:\r\n- Игра для детей одобрена для обучения ребенка математике учителями начальной школы.\r\n- В игре реализовано пошаговое освоение таблицы умножения, с постепенным нарастанием сложности и разнообразия задач. Если ты – в самом начале обучения таблице умножения, выбирай одно-два числа.\r\n\r\n- Игра-тренажер – это идеальное сочетание математики и развлекательных игр для девочек и мальчиков.\r\n- Тренируйся в умножении ежедневно, получай достижения и собирай награды.\r\n- Выдержи «Контрольную работу» с отличницей Лизой Барбоскиной – и «пятёрка» на контрольной в школе гарантирована! \r\nВыучить таблицу умножения детям к школе бывает непросто, особенно трудно приходится их родителям.\r\n2 х 2 = 5 или 3?\r\nУстановите приложение и помогите ребенку выучить таблицу умножения!"

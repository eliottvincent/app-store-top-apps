We call these interactive mobile rallies “Bounds”, essentially a collection of diverse tasks, e.g., taking pictures, dancing, playing a game etc., linked to a specific location. \n\nThe program quite literally augments our reality by enhancing peoples’ real-life interaction whilst using their smart phones and tablets. Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture. In contrast to a geo-cache or a scavenger hunt Actionbound requires the players to create their own content."

From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Все ответы озвучены. \n\nТак как упражнения, где нужно тупо кликать на правильный перевод слова или на правильную форму глагола ведут к отупению и неумению соображать самостоятельно, мы сделали упражнения по другому.\n\nВ наших упражнениях нужно самому сделать перевод всего предложения. Вы всегда можете свериться с ответами. 80% слов Вы найдете либо в теории урока, либо в предыдущих упражнениях, так что заглядывать в словарь на каждом слове совершенно необязательно. И запоминание слов происходит на практике, когда Вы самостоятельно строите фразы и предложения.\n\nНу а если что-то вызывает сложность, просто обратитесь в нашу языковую поддержку. Для этого Вам достаточно написать нам email из приложения, либо иметь установленный на телефоне скайп и желание отработать инвестированное в занятие время. Просто позвоните в языковую поддержку и проясните неясные вопросы голосом!\n\n***\n\nВозможности программы:\n- полная версия бесплатного курса \"Польский язык за 7 уроков\"\n- интерактивные упражнения для проверки знаний и закрепления материала\n- аудио-материалы с объяснениями уроков и упражнений\n- видео-материалы с объяснениями уроков (требуется подключение к Интернету)\n- быстрый переход на сайт speakASAP\n- быстрое создание письма в службу языковой поддержки speakASAP\n- все материалы (за исключением Видео-раздела) находятся на Вашем устройстве и для использования не требуется подключение к Интернету\n\n***\n\nПодписывайтесь в наши группы:\nhttp://vk.com/speakASAP\nhttp://www.facebook.com/speakASAP\nhttp://twitter.com/speakASAP\nhttp://blog.eustudy.ru\n\nПодписывайтесь на наш канал на youtube:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/eustudy\n\n***\n\nМы так же будем рады получить от Вас любые отклики, комментарии и предложения на адрес: admin@speakasap.com\n\n***\n\nУстанавливайте! Тестируйте! Сообщайте о багах! Учите в свое удовольствие!\n\nЗа дополнительной информацией обращайтесь на сайт \nhttp://speakasap.com/ru/polish-in-7-lessons.html\n\nАвтор курса Елена Шипилова и команда speakASAP."

Whether it’s Harry Potter in German, French nuclear physics, or Spanish colors, you can learn the words most important to you (available in some courses).\n\nMOTIVATIONAL STATISTICS\nPacked with data on your learning progress, you’ll be able to chart your path to success.\n\nA MUST-HAVE TOOL IN YOUR BAG\nDo you live in your target country, use a tutor or language school, or even read books, listen to podcasts, or watch content in your target language?

It’s the difference between passing your test or acing it.\n\nLEARN BY DOING\nYou will learn vocabulary or conjugations (available in some courses) by “guessing” the answer. Getting it wrong is one of the fastest ways to learn, and your brain will start to remember very quickly.\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe playlist feature lets you listen to bite-sized sentences in hands-free mode.\n\nPERSONALIZED SETTINGS\nEvery learner is different. Personalize your learning to suit you, with various settings allowing you to learn with extra slow speech, strict diacritics, and even grammar tables.\n\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING PLAN\nWe'll serve you new words that are most relevant to you. As we measure your memory curves, we ask you to repeat words at the optimal time – just before you forget them. This way, you'll always know what to learn next.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING MADE EASY\nWhether you are planning on spending this summer in Italy and need to learn Italian, or your next adventure is taking up a course in Germany and you need an app to learn German, we have you covered. Our language learning techniques will help you to get fluent in over 9 languages.\n\n=====\n\nSUBSCRIPTION\nYou will need a subscription in order to get access to the full learning materials for all languages we offer.

In a matter of minutes, you will understand how to build sentences correctly, how to inflect verbs, nouns or adjectives. Fun Polish lessons improve your vocabulary and grammar like no other language learning method.\n\nHow to learn Polish?\nLearning any language starts with grammar. To start speaking Polish, you need to understand how to make a banal sentence, how to inflect words correctly. After all, without knowing the basics, it is impossible to effectively learn a language.\n\nWhat's the best way to learn the basics?\nThis is of course easier to do in practice. Who is interested in studying theory, when you can first try and if you make a mistake, see the rule. Polish B1 works exactly according to this principle. It consists of many exams on the most important topics for language acquisition. Each exam simulates a real Polish B1 level exam. And each question has a detailed explanation.\n\nChat and share information.\nIt is always best to have access to a community of people doing the same thing. A chat is integrated into the Polish language B1, in which you can always ask a question of interest. Ask about the rule, find out how the real exam is going, or just find friends.\n\nAn effective exam preparation system.\nThe exam simulator will bring your question-answering skills to automatism. We cooperate with professional teachers of the Polish language with more than 10 years of experience. With such a teacher, you don't have to worry about successfully passing the exam.\n\n◆ The questions are the same as those used in the exam.\n◆ Convenient interface that allows you to immediately sort out incorrect answers.\n◆ Detailed explanation of the rule for each question.\n\nAfter completing our Polish lessons, you will be able to understand texts fluently, know how verbs, nouns or adjectives are inflected, and know the basic turns of speech. This knowledge is more than enough for you to communicate in Polish comfortably on a daily basis.\n\nTerms of Use and Privacy Policy: https://bit.ly/2vZtV50"

      "label": "Букляндия - это азбука для детей! Это потрясающая игра, которая познакомит малышей с буквами. В интерактивной форме ребята будут играть с героями и знакомиться с новыми словами. В приложении содержаться сотни проработанных анимаций, множество деталей. Всё для того, чтобы дети полюбили буквы и азбуку!\n\nБукляндия удивительна во всём, даже в истории её создания. Мы бы хотели поделиться этой историей с вами.\n\nВсё началось в далёком 2014 году. Именно тогда Александр Евсеев и Константин Донской захотели покорить App Store, создав своё приложение. Они решили создать азбуку для детей. ( На самом деле, очень многие разработчики начинают с создания своей азбуки, но не у всех получается. ) Так вот ребята обсудили концепт и начали усердно работать над своей первой игрой. На протяжении года Саша тщательно отрисовывал всех персонажей, продумывал каждую анимацию, каждое слово, которое будет связано с буквой. Аниматор подхватывал идеи и оживлял персонажей. А разработчику оставалось соединить всё вместе и запустить игру на любимом устройстве с яблочком. Было еще много дополнительных этапов: долгая работа над звуками, музыкой, озвучкой, улучшение анимаций, иллюстраций и тд.\n\nТак как букв в нашем алфавите много, требуется очень много сил, чтобы каждая буква не уступала предыдущей. К сожалению, сил не хватило, ребята так и не выпустили свою игру. Им оставалось совсем немножко, но иногда бывает, что силы и желание заканчиваются, когда ты находишься у самого финиша...\n\nВсё изменилось в 2019 году, когда мы познакомились с Сашей Евсеевым, работая над другим проектом. Саша рассказал о Букляндии, показал её, и она мне понравилась. Столько деталей, столько труда в неё было вложено. Мне очень захотелось помочь и выпустить её, чтобы как можно больше детей смогли в неё поиграть. Чтобы труд Саши и остальных ребят был не напрасен и оценен по достоинству.\n\nОбговорив условия, мы начали сотрудничать. В течение нескольких месяцев мы искали подходящего разработчика, так как для разработки использовался специфический игровой движок. И мы нашли Андрея Кирюшкина. Он помог обновить игру под новые устройства и исправил ошибки. И теперь вы можете её бесплатно скачать =)\n\nВот такая непростая и долгая история создания Букляндии. Мы очень благодарны вам за то, что вы прочитали это длинное описание, ведь по статистике это делают меньше 3% пользователей. Надеемся, вам понравится наша Букляндия, игра из прошлого, которая ожила в нашем времени..."

Score 100% in the games and you can unlock an extra topic for free.\n\n\nWHY UTALK WORKS:\n\n1. LEARN FROM THE LOCALS: We record native speakers so you hear every word pronounced clearly. Mimic their pronunciation and compare your intonation with theirs. Practise until you get it right – you can even slow the audio down if it’s too fast.\n\n2. USEFUL EVERYDAY WORDS AND PHRASES. Topics take around two to three hours to complete. But you can dip in for just five minutes at a time or longer. With 60+ topics, that’s a total of 180 hours of learning.\n\n3.

      "label": "Уважаемые родители, мы рады представить вам новую игру для детей!\n\nОсновные задачи игры:\n\n1. Научить ребёнка обобщать предметы в группы (категории). \nДля этого игра знакомит ребенка с 6-тью основными группами предметов, которые окружают нас ежедневно – мебель, транспорт, игрушки, посуда, обувь, одежда.\n\n2. Сформировать у ребенка понимание отрицания и значение \"лишнего\". \nДля этого, мы поместили в группы предметов элементы из других категорий и просим ребенка сделать правильную сортировку – например, «Положи одежду в шкаф, а лишнее – в коробку!», акцентируя внимание на том, что «лишний» предмет НЕ принадлежит к данной группе. \n\n3. Научить воспринимать и понимать речь других детей.\nИгра озвучена детским голосом. В игре более 300 озвученных аудио файлов.\n\n4. Знакомство с профессиями. \nДля этого игра знакомит ребенка с профессиями и просит детей помочь мастерам (швея, мебельщик, сапожник, повар, механик) собрать предметы, с которыми они связаны в своей работе.\n\n5. Знакомство с известными классическими музыкальными произведениями. \nМы подобрали 12 великих музыкальных произведений Моцарта, Чайковского, Бетховена, Прокофьева, Штрауса, Паганини и других. Каждую композицию сопровождает озвучивание названия и имени композитора, а также забавный персонаж, который визуально поможет быстрее запомнить эти названия.\n\nОБ ИГРЕ:\n• 14 развивающих игр - уроков\n• 8 обучающих тем для малышей\n• более 100 объектов\n• детский голос в озвучивании игры\n• развитие памяти, логического мышления и мелкой моторики\n• реальные картинки предметов \n• забавные персонажи \n• удобный и понятный интерфейс\n• оригинальная графика и оформление\n• для детей от 2 до 5 лет\n• родительский контроль\n• отсутствие сторонней рекламы\n\nСкачивайте и другие наши игры для малышей: www.kidco.top"

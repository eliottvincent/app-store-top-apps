Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.\n- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.\n\nSensors supported:\n- Accelerometer\n- Magnetometer\n- Gyroscope\n- Pressure\n- Microphone\n- Proximity\n- GPS\n*some sensors are not present on every phone.\n\nExport formats\n- CSV (Comma separated values)\n- TSV (Tab-separated values)\n- Excel\n(if you need other formats, please let us know)\n\n\nThis app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University."

      "label": "Букляндия - это азбука для детей! Это потрясающая игра, которая познакомит малышей с буквами. В интерактивной форме ребята будут играть с героями и знакомиться с новыми словами. В приложении содержаться сотни проработанных анимаций, множество деталей. Всё для того, чтобы дети полюбили буквы и азбуку!\n\nБукляндия удивительна во всём, даже в истории её создания. Мы бы хотели поделиться этой историей с вами.\n\nВсё началось в далёком 2014 году. Именно тогда Александр Евсеев и Константин Донской захотели покорить App Store, создав своё приложение. Они решили создать азбуку для детей. ( На самом деле, очень многие разработчики начинают с создания своей азбуки, но не у всех получается. ) Так вот ребята обсудили концепт и начали усердно работать над своей первой игрой. На протяжении года Саша тщательно отрисовывал всех персонажей, продумывал каждую анимацию, каждое слово, которое будет связано с буквой. Аниматор подхватывал идеи и оживлял персонажей. А разработчику оставалось соединить всё вместе и запустить игру на любимом устройстве с яблочком. Было еще много дополнительных этапов: долгая работа над звуками, музыкой, озвучкой, улучшение анимаций, иллюстраций и тд.\n\nТак как букв в нашем алфавите много, требуется очень много сил, чтобы каждая буква не уступала предыдущей. К сожалению, сил не хватило, ребята так и не выпустили свою игру. Им оставалось совсем немножко, но иногда бывает, что силы и желание заканчиваются, когда ты находишься у самого финиша...\n\nВсё изменилось в 2019 году, когда мы познакомились с Сашей Евсеевым, работая над другим проектом. Саша рассказал о Букляндии, показал её, и она мне понравилась. Столько деталей, столько труда в неё было вложено. Мне очень захотелось помочь и выпустить её, чтобы как можно больше детей смогли в неё поиграть. Чтобы труд Саши и остальных ребят был не напрасен и оценен по достоинству.\n\nОбговорив условия, мы начали сотрудничать. В течение нескольких месяцев мы искали подходящего разработчика, так как для разработки использовался специфический игровой движок. И мы нашли Андрея Кирюшкина. Он помог обновить игру под новые устройства и исправил ошибки. И теперь вы можете её бесплатно скачать =)\n\nВот такая непростая и долгая история создания Букляндии. Мы очень благодарны вам за то, что вы прочитали это длинное описание, ведь по статистике это делают меньше 3% пользователей. Надеемся, вам понравится наша Букляндия, игра из прошлого, которая ожила в нашем времени..."

      "label": "The Arduino Science Journal (formerly Science Journal, an initiative by Google) is free and allows you to gather data about the world around you by harnessing the sensors in your smartphone as well as sensors connected to Arduino. The Science Journal transforms smartphones and tablets into science notebooks that encourage students to explore their world.\n\nThe Arduino Science Journal app is recommended for students from 10 to 18 years of age.\n\nAbout Arduino Science Journal\nWith the Arduino Science Journal, you can learn interactively, conduct experiments and iterate on findings.\n\n•  Enhance your existing lesson plans: use the Science Journal with activities and assignments you have already prepared\n•  Classroom & home-school friendly: you don’t have to be in a classroom setting to start exploring. The Arduino Science Journal can be used to run experiments straight away, as long as you have your smartphone or tablet with you! \n•  Move learning outside: the use of mobile devices along with the types of experiments we offer encourage students to get out of their seats and open their eyes to the world around them through the power of science\n•  Science and data have no secrets: you can easily record your observations, store your data sensors in real-time and analyse them, just as a proper scientist! \n•  Connect the digital and the physical world from your pocket: go through a series of simple tutorials and start having fun with science\n\nWith built-in device sensors as well as external hardware, you can measure light, sound, movement, and much more.  You can also compare results, and even set triggers. \n\nTogether with the external hardware, (not included with the app), students are enabled to conduct more complex experiments, and advance in their scientific studies. As long as the external sensors are compatible with a Bluetooth-connecting device such as a microcontroller, there is no end to what experiments the students can make. Some popular sensors that the app can work with are: light, conductivity, temperature, force, gas, heart rate, respiration, radiation, pressure, magnetism, and many more.\n\nThe app is classroom-friendly, since students can sign in on any device and access their experiments to continue exploring the world, wherever they are!\n\nIf you’re an educator with a Google Classroom account, you can also subscribe to the Teacher Plan, which allows you to integrate the app with Google Classroom and share this integration with your students. You can then create assignments, templates, and experiments in the app and import existing classes from Google Classroom.\n\nPermissions notice:\n\n• Bluetooth: needed to scan for Bluetooth sensor devices.\n• Camera: needed to take pictures to document experiments and for the brightness sensor.\n• Photo Library: needed to store pictures taken to document experiments and for adding existing photos from your library to experiments.\n• Microphone: needed for sound intensity sensor.\n• Push notifications: needed to inform you of recording status when backgrounding the app.\n\nBenefits of using the Arduino Science Journal\n• It’s free and simple to use\n• Easy setup: download the app and start exploring with your phone’s built-in sensors\n• Cross-platform support\n• Portable: enhance your home learning or bring your device outside to study the world around you\n• Safe for children to use: COPPA Compliance underway \n• Fully compatible with Arduino hardware: keep experimenting with the Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab, as well as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board\n• Google Drive integration, as well as local download\n\n---\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.arduino.cc/en/sj-terms-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy\nChildren's Privacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/children-privacy-policy"

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Does the idea of getting your G1 licence make your palms sweaty? Caps your enthusiasm? It should - because it's one of the most important steps you'll ever take.\nG1 Genie is the #1 app for G1 test prep, so you'll pass the first time. It's the fastest way to prepare. Our users swear that most of the questions on the real G1 test are very similar (often identical) to those G1 Genie offers. You’ll know exactly what to expect since our practice tests have the same scoring system as the actual G1 test.\nLet us help you breeze through your G1 knowledge exam. You deserve independence. You deserve to live your dream. Don't gamble with your future. And don't go it alone.\nDriving is awesome, but passing the G1 test shouldn't be so complex. We make it easy for you to be fully prepared by providing easy-to-use tools to make studying effortless and fun. Rather than try to memorize boring facts and numbers, get comfortable answering exam-like questions that range from easy to knuckle-cracking hard. You won’t even notice you're studying; you’ll want to keep taking the tests until you pass them all.\nJoin thousands of Ontario learner drivers who passed their G1 written test using this app. With G1 Genie, you’ll breeze through your exam and walk out of the DriveTest center feeling like you just took a first-grade spelling test.\nTake your G1 prep to the next level with the super-realistic Exam Simulator, Challenge Bank™, Passing Probability, and more. Recommended by top driving schools and independent driving instructors.\nDownload it right now, and be ready to ace your G1 exam tomorrow.\nWhat you’ll love about G1 Genie:\n• All 300+ exam-like questions based on the Ontario Driver's Handbook and seen on the official exam.\n• The realistic G1 Exam Simulator is as close as it gets to the actual G1 driver's test experience. It mimics the experience of a real G1 test, pulling random questions from a vast database.\n• Challenge Bank™ is a new type of test that's automatically made up of your missed questions from all your practice tests. You can go back and review the questions that you got wrong.\n• Passing Probability score is calculated in real-time based on your activity and displays how you'd score on the official G1 test if you took it today.\n• Multiple difficulty levels: Study at your own pace as you move from Easy to the Exam Simulator.\n• Simple and fun to use: We’ve simplified the vague and complex language of driving rules so you can quickly master the concepts and answer the question correctly next time, no matter how it’s worded on the exam.\n• Works offline: no internet connection needed.\n• Detailed explanations reveal the \"why\" behind every answer. For each question, you’ll see an explanation of the right answer immediately.\n• Smart hints help with tricky questions and steer you in the right direction.\nG1 Genie is the perfect practice app for beginners, but it also includes plenty of challenging G1 practice questions for renewal applicants and advanced drivers. Every question is based on the official Driver's Handbook issued by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, so you can be sure you're studying the most recent materials.\nYou'll be surprised how close the app is to the real thing!\n\"Really prepares you for the G1 test. I passed with flying colours and it’s the closest thing you can get to taking the actual test in advance. So worth it!\" - Terry G., Markham\n\"Just study with this every day for like 30 mins, and when you write the actual exam, you'll be fine.\" - Jaden Bediako, Team Canada, National basketball player\nPremium membership pricing and terms:\nG1 Genie offers a one-time Premium Lifetime membership to provide you with unlimited access to the training materials, which is paid for by a one-off upfront payment with unlimited access to the full functionality forever.\nHave questions, problems, or feedback?

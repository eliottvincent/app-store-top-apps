From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Try the Rosetta Stone app yourself for free. \n\nMany online language learning apps will promise that you can learn a language in just a few minutes a day. However, there is a significant difference between memorizing vocabulary lists and speaking a language with confidence. Learning a language is about more than just the words. One of the mistakes new language learners make is treating language as an object or an end goal instead of as an experience.\n\nDitch the books, translator, and dictionary, and surround yourself with a language whenever, wherever with the Rosetta Stone mobile app. \n\n\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n• 2019 PCMag Editors’ Choice\n• 2019 Tabby Awards Winner\n• 2019 Best Mobile App Awards: Best Designed App and Best Overall App\n\n\n\nRosetta Stone has taught millions of people new languages, and you’re next.

      "label": "This application is dedicated to one of the most complicated topic in the English language — Phrasal Verbs. There are dozens of rules and nuances in this topic, but we have made maybe the easiest way to deal with it.\n\nWhen we face a phrasal verb for the first time, they usually do not know HOW to translate it and then HOW to use it. The problem occurs rather often because there are more than 10000+ phrasal verbs in English. That means, that we meet them every day in the spoken and written language.\n\nBut at the same time, such a big number does not mean that all of these phrasal verbs are of common usage. The majority of them just rest inside the vocabulary. Native speakers know them but they hardly use them in every day speech. \n\nThat is why we have collected phrasal verbs of wide usage. They will help you extend your vocabulary and understand native speakers.\n\nBeing the developer, we take much care about our users. We understand clearly that it is not appropriate to give just a list of verbs like all other vocabularies do. It is not comfortable for learning, understanding and practice.\n\nWe really believe that learning apps should develop students’ skills in a clear and simple way. That is why you will find a very friendly interface and useful functions inside the app.\n\nWe have included 200 phrasal verbs. You can read and learn them in two ways:\n— use an alphabetical list and open a card with the verb you do not know;\n— fun game and practice to remember phrasal verb\n— quiz with more than 10 level to improve phrasal verbs.\n\nEvery card contains a simple explanation and an example of usage. Also every verb is marked separable/inseparable. Students can use bookmarks to form the list of necessary phrasal verbs. \n\nAfter you have studied the verbs you are able to check your knowledge. We have made up a collection of quiz where users are offered to choose the needed phrasal verb or to choose the needed meaning. When you complete a test the app shows you the result and mistakes.\n\nDownload and enjoy. It 's free."

Every word you know, and every word you don't. All 25,000 useful English words are ranked in the order of IMPORTANCE, and USEFULNESS, based on how often they are used in real-world spoken English (extracted from thousands of movies, and TV shows).\r\n\r\nBy creating your Knowledge Map in WordUp, you constantly discover the most valuable next word to learn that you don't know yet, and focus on learning them in that order. It's the smartest way to spend your time learning!\r\n\r\nTo actually learn the words that you discover in your Knowledge Map, WordUp gives you everything you need, and more! From word definitions and pictures to tens of entertaining examples from movies, quotes, news, and more. So you get a good feel of how to use each word in context. There are also translations in more than 30 languages including French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, ...\r\n\r\nThe daily reviews then kick in. Like flashcards, the words will come back with games and challenges until you master them. It's called Spaced Repetition, and it's scientifically proven to help memorise them forever!\r\n\r\nWordUp is unlike any vocabulary builder app you've seen before. It is not another dictionary app, although it can be used as an English dictionary too. \r\n\r\nWordUp's novel approach to language learning and expanding your vocabulary will leave you feeling confident and empowered. Whether you are new to English, are preparing for an English exam (IELTS, TOEFL, etc), or are a native English speaker, you will find WordUp helpful and entertaining.

      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

We call these interactive mobile rallies “Bounds”, essentially a collection of diverse tasks, e.g., taking pictures, dancing, playing a game etc., linked to a specific location. \n\nThe program quite literally augments our reality by enhancing peoples’ real-life interaction whilst using their smart phones and tablets. Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture. In contrast to a geo-cache or a scavenger hunt Actionbound requires the players to create their own content."

Each new word comes with a translation and a memorable illustration.\nYou’ll learn new words every day. And with the spaced repetition, smart reminders, and clever associations, you won’t forget them. \n\n\nYou also get to practice your new vocabulary right away in conversations that recreate real-life situations. Here are some of the scenarios you’ll learn from:\n\n-   \tPassport control\n-   \tChecking in at the hotel\n-     Hailing a cab\n-   \tOrdering food in a restaurant\n-   \tVisiting a museum\n-   \tShopping at a supermarket\n-   \tPartying at a bar\n-   \tMeeting new people\n-   \tJob interview\n-   \tand more than 50 other topics\n\nPERFECT YOUR GRAMMAR\n\nSpeak correctly right from the start.\nYou’ll easily master the grammar topics thanks to interactive exercises and easy-to-understand grammar explanations.

      "label": "The Arduino Science Journal (formerly Science Journal, an initiative by Google) is free and allows you to gather data about the world around you by harnessing the sensors in your smartphone as well as sensors connected to Arduino. The Science Journal transforms smartphones and tablets into science notebooks that encourage students to explore their world.\n\nThe Arduino Science Journal app is recommended for students from 10 to 18 years of age.\n\nAbout Arduino Science Journal\nWith the Arduino Science Journal, you can learn interactively, conduct experiments and iterate on findings.\n\n•  Enhance your existing lesson plans: use the Science Journal with activities and assignments you have already prepared\n•  Classroom & home-school friendly: you don’t have to be in a classroom setting to start exploring. The Arduino Science Journal can be used to run experiments straight away, as long as you have your smartphone or tablet with you! \n•  Move learning outside: the use of mobile devices along with the types of experiments we offer encourage students to get out of their seats and open their eyes to the world around them through the power of science\n•  Science and data have no secrets: you can easily record your observations, store your data sensors in real-time and analyse them, just as a proper scientist! \n•  Connect the digital and the physical world from your pocket: go through a series of simple tutorials and start having fun with science\n\nWith built-in device sensors as well as external hardware, you can measure light, sound, movement, and much more.  You can also compare results, and even set triggers. \n\nTogether with the external hardware, (not included with the app), students are enabled to conduct more complex experiments, and advance in their scientific studies. As long as the external sensors are compatible with a Bluetooth-connecting device such as a microcontroller, there is no end to what experiments the students can make. Some popular sensors that the app can work with are: light, conductivity, temperature, force, gas, heart rate, respiration, radiation, pressure, magnetism, and many more.\n\nThe app is classroom-friendly, since students can sign in on any device and access their experiments to continue exploring the world, wherever they are!\n\nIf you’re an educator with a Google Classroom account, you can also subscribe to the Teacher Plan, which allows you to integrate the app with Google Classroom and share this integration with your students. You can then create assignments, templates, and experiments in the app and import existing classes from Google Classroom.\n\nPermissions notice:\n\n• Bluetooth: needed to scan for Bluetooth sensor devices.\n• Camera: needed to take pictures to document experiments and for the brightness sensor.\n• Photo Library: needed to store pictures taken to document experiments and for adding existing photos from your library to experiments.\n• Microphone: needed for sound intensity sensor.\n• Push notifications: needed to inform you of recording status when backgrounding the app.\n\nBenefits of using the Arduino Science Journal\n• It’s free and simple to use\n• Easy setup: download the app and start exploring with your phone’s built-in sensors\n• Cross-platform support\n• Portable: enhance your home learning or bring your device outside to study the world around you\n• Safe for children to use: COPPA Compliance underway \n• Fully compatible with Arduino hardware: keep experimenting with the Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab, as well as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board\n• Google Drive integration, as well as local download\n\n---\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.arduino.cc/en/sj-terms-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy\nChildren's Privacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/children-privacy-policy"

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom.

Over 1 million bright minds saved more than 14 million ideas in their personal library so far.\n\nIt's like your social media feed, if your social media feed had things that mattered :-)\n\nKnowledge in Deepstash comes in the form of ideas, represented as little cards you can read at a glance. Ideas are short notes that condense profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be: the best ideas from a book or article, inspiring quotes, practical tips on any topic. Each idea belongs to a topic, from #marketing to #leadership and #philosophy, which you can follow.\n\nIdeas are created by Deepstash members, called stashers. Whenever a stasher reads a book article or listens to a podcast and they find a concept, a thought or quote that is worth saving, remembering and sharing, they will add an idea about it in Deepstash.\n\nA daily source of inspiring & life changing stories and ideas. Read articles, learn skills, get productivity tips and discover life hacks. The magic of Deepstash is that everything you do builds your knowledge library: be it contributing  your own ideas or collecting idea cards from other stashers. Fuel your curiosity and get smarter daily.\n\nPERSONALIZED CONTENT & FEEDS\n\nChoose a few topics of interest (more than 4,000 topics to choose from) and then just use Deepstash at your leisure. As you read and save ideas, we learn what you like and find the best stories, articles, books, podcasts and other top content to show you every day. You don’t even have to work for it.\n\nThe more you save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh ideas.\n\nBUILD AND ORGANIZE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nYou can save ideas in your own profile and build your own library of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you and which you can use at any time.\n\nSearch and filter your ideas and organize your knowledge into personalized stashes, which are basically collections of insights stocked up and ready to go for when you need them: a Powerpoint presentation, a new job interview, a date, a project at work, or negotiating your rent with the landlord.\n\nSHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE\n\nAdd your own ideas and stash them in your knowledge library so you always have them at hand.\n\nShare your own or other ideas you find with your friends and colleagues on Whatsapp or Facebook or send it to your followers on Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin or Quora. The Deepstash bite-sized idea format is great for this. \n\nShare a link to ideas or just an image. We built special image formats for each social network (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and others) so your ideas will look their best.\n\nNO ADS. NO DISTRACTIONS\n\nThe Deepstash app is free and open to everyone. Get a clean reading experience and focus on the content instead of being distracted with annoying ads. Just get a quick free account (Facebook & Google login) and you’re good to go.\n\nGood for your career. \nGreat for your life. \nGive it a shot!\n\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://deepstash.com/terms-of-service\nPrivacy policy: https://deepstash.com/privacy-policy"

Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado.

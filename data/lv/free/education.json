      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Pl@ntNet is an application that allows you to identify plants simply by photographing them with your smartphone. Very useful when you don't have a botanist on hand!\n\nPl@ntNet is also a great citizen science project: all the plants you photograph are collected and analysed by scientists around the world to better understand the evolution of plant biodiversity and to better preserve it.\n\nPl@ntNet allows you to identify and better understand all kinds of plants living in nature: flowering plants, trees, grasses, conifers, ferns, vines, wild salads, cacti (and many more). \n\nPl@ntNet can also identify a large number of cultivated plants (in parks and gardens) but this is not its primary purpose. We especially need Pl@ntNet’s users to inventory the wild plants, those that you can observe in nature, but also those that grow on the sidewalks of cities or in the middle of your vegetable garden!\n\nThe more visual information you give to Pl@ntNet about the plant you are observing, the more accurate the identification will be. There are indeed many plants that look alike from afar and it is sometimes small details that distinguish two species of the same genus. \n\nFlowers, fruits and leaves are the most characteristic organs of a species and it is them that should be photographed first. But any other detail can be useful, such as thorns, buds or hair on the stem. A photograph of the whole plant is also very useful information, but it is often not sufficient to allow a reliable identification.\n\nAt present, Pl@ntNet makes it possible to recognize about 20,000 species. We are still a long way from the 360,000 species living on earth, but Pl@ntNet is getting richer every day thanks to the contributions of the most experienced users among you. \n\nDon't be afraid to contribute yourself! Your observation will be reviewed by the community and may one day join the photo gallery illustrating the species in the application.\n\nThe new version of Pl@ntNet released in January 2019 includes many improvements and new features:\n-The ability to filter recognized species by genus or family.\n-The differentiated data revision that gives more weight to users who have demonstrated the most skills (in particular the number of species observed, validated by the community).\n-The re-identification of shared observations, whether yours or those of other users of the application.\n-The multi-flora identification that allows you to search for the photographed plant in all the flora of the application and not only in the one you have selected. Very useful when you are not sure what flora to look for.\n-The selection of your favorite floras to access them more quickly.\n-The navigation at different taxonomic levels in image galleries.\n-The mapping of your observations.\n-Links to many factsheets.\n\nThe web version of the application is also available at the following address: https://identify.plantnet.org/"

      "label": "Елена Шипилова представляет бесплатный курс \"Норвежский язык за 7 уроков\", который поможет Вам с абсолютного нуля поднять свой норвежский до уровня нормального общения на основные темы!\n\nПрограмма представлена сайтом: http://speakasap.com\n\nКурс для начинающих и поэтому построен просто, логично, структурировано и кратко.\n\nВ курс вошла только базовая грамматика норвежского языка, которая чаще всего используются людьми со всего мира для нормального и свободного общения на норвежском языке.\n\nКаждый урок озвучен, даны нормальные понятные объяснения, что позволяет Вам слушать наш курс в дороге в любое время.\n\nВсе упражнения построены в рамках разбираемой темы урока с полезным и ходовым словарным запасом. Все ответы озвучены. \n\nТак как упражнения, где нужно тупо кликать на правильный перевод слова или на правильную форму глагола ведут к отупению и неумению соображать самостоятельно, мы сделали упражнения по другому.\n\nВ наших упражнениях нужно самому сделать перевод всего предложения. Вы всегда можете свериться с ответами. 80% слов Вы найдете либо в теории урока, либо в предыдущих упражнениях, так что заглядывать в словарь на каждом слове совершенно необязательно. И запоминание слов происходит на практике, когда Вы самостоятельно строите фразы и предложения.\n\nНу а если что-то вызывает сложность, просто обратитесь в нашу языковую поддержку. Для этого Вам достаточно написать нам email из приложения, либо иметь установленный на телефоне скайп и желание отработать инвестированное в занятие время. Просто позвоните в языковую поддержку и проясните неясные вопросы голосом!\n\n***\n\nВозможности программы:\n- полная версия бесплатного курса \"Норвежский язык за 7 уроков\"\n- интерактивные упражнения для проверки знаний и закрепления материала\n- аудио-материалы с объяснениями уроков и упражнений\n- видео-материалы с объяснениями уроков (требуется подключение к Интернету)\n- быстрый переход на сайт speakASAP\n- быстрое создание письма в службу языковой поддержки speakASAP\n- все материалы (за исключением Видео-раздела) находятся на Вашем устройстве и для использования не требуется подключение к Интернету\n\n***\n\nПодписывайтесь в наши группы:\nhttp://vk.com/speakASAP\nhttp://www.facebook.com/speakASAP\nhttp://twitter.com/speakASAP\nhttp://blog.eustudy.ru\n\nПодписывайтесь на наш канал на youtube:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/eustudy\n\n***\n\nМы так же будем рады получить от Вас любые отклики, комментарии и предложения на адрес: admin@speakasap.com\n\n***\n\nУстанавливайте! Тестируйте! Сообщайте о багах! Учите в свое удовольствие!\n\nЗа дополнительной информацией обращайтесь на сайт \nhttp://speakasap.com/ru/norwegian-in-7-lessons.html\n\nАвтор курса Елена Шипилова и команда speakASAP."

It is a place where to learn about the versatility of the human body. Moreover, to learn about it in reality – to see what usually is seen only by the surgeon or anatomist. The museum is developed on the basis of the first anatomical collection for study purposes in Latvia. It was started in the Anatomy Theatre in the first half of the 20th century and since 2020 anyone interested is welcome to get acquainted with the new collection.\r\n\n20 exciting exhibits\r\nThe museum displays anatomical specimens – organs and parts of the body –  the anatomists prepared for the training of medical students in the 1920s-1930s. Even today, they help people to learn about human anatomy, its normalcy and variations, human development and deviations from the norm. On the one hand, 20 exciting exhibits give an overview about all the main themes of the exposition. On the other hand, each of them is unique with its own extraordinary story."

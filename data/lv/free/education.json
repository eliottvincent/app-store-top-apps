      "label": "Math can be fun. For everyone. From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

Apart from the altruistic goal of helping people to discover “their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture”, the free app is payable for corporate clients, who can use Actionbound for team-building events and the likes.\n\nActionbound is an interactive app-based game approach for smart phones and tablets: Players are invited to accomplish tasks, which can be defined through the so-called Bound-Creator on the website actionbound.com, in order to playfully discover their environment by learning more about its history, politics and culture.

All you need is a good connection and time to spare.\n\nTalk to native speakers\nThe app also includes Skyeng Talks - 15-minute classes with native speakers. They are suitable for all levels, and can even help beginners to overcome the language barrier and continue to improve their spoke English. In 1-2 minutes the app will find you a teacher from anywhere in the world - from Australia to South Africa, and you will chat via video call about any topic you want.\n\nLearn more about English\nBrush up on grammar rules, practice pronunciation, or learn the latest news from the U.S. and the U.K. - all of this is available in the app's stories and articles.

      "label": "Память - одна из когнитивных функций мозга, наиболее страдающих при старении.\n\nРазвитие памяти, ума, внимания и интеллекта часто представляет собой смежные задачи. Умение запоминать информацию является важным навыком для ума. Тренировка памяти несложный, но постоянный процесс.\n\nMemoris – приложение для развития памяти, охватывающее все ее виды, включает 9 тренажеров памяти:\n\n1. Зрительная память – развитие эйдетической памяти (фотографическая память), внимания и фокусировки.\n2. Слуховое восприятие – тренировка вербальной памяти. Развитие мышления и воображения.\n3. Восприятие текста - тренировка памяти по текстам с применением мнемотехник.\n4. Анаграммы – развитие абстрактно-логического мышления и креативности. Упражнения на память в виде необычных анаграмм. Логическое мышление.\n5. Математика - развитие памяти и мышления для умных. Концентрация внимания\n6. Тест Струпа - когнитивная гибкость и концентрация внимания. Лучший тренажер для концентрации.\n7. Запоминание слов - тренинг памяти через запоминание слов при помощи мнемотехник. Креативное мышление.\n8. Викторина Эрудит - интеллектуальная игра в формате \"вопросы и ответы\" для развития кругозора и эрудиции. Умная викторина со сложными вопросами\n9. Таблица Шульте - внимание, развитие мозга и скорочтение. Это таблицы служащие для развития быстроты объектов.\n\nПомимо тренажеров для памяти в приложении есть библиотека образовательных статей о развитии памяти, здоровье, личностном росте и долголетии.\n\nМетодика развития памяти Рюта Кавашима\n\nНаш тренажер для мозга содержит 3 тренажера на память эффективность которых доказана известным исследователем памяти.\nРюта Кавашима (Kumon) - ведущий японский специалист по томографии мозга, исследует, как функционирует мозг, память и интеллект.\n\nНаше приложение развития памяти поможет вам стать умнее и:\n\n1. Лучше воспринимать и перерабатывать информацию. Умные мозги и хорошая память способствует развитию такого навыка как - запоминание. Выявления полезной и нужной информации и отсечения всего ненужного и недостоверного.\n\n2. Эффективнее обучаться. Отменная память пригодится в любой области независимо от того, учитесь вы в школе, университете или повышаете квалификацию. Чем более развита ваша способность к запоминанию, тем больше вы можете знать и применять на практике.\n\n3. Развивать мышление и кругозор. Разум и качество мышления зависит от количества и качества нейронных связей в головном мозге. Постоянные восприятие, обработка, запоминание, задачи для мозга и воспроизведение данных отлично сказываются на здоровье мозга, делают интеллект более подвижным.\n\n4. Предупредить болезни. С возрастом мозг человека неизбежно претерпевает изменения, вследствие чего ухудшается кратковременная память, снижаются когнитивные способности, развиваются дегенеративные болезни типа болезни Альцгеймера. Регулярные занятия по развитию памяти помогают предотвратить болезни мозга.\n\n5. Больше помнить. Это самое очевидное преимущество тренировки памяти. \n\nOxford full access:\n\nMonthly subscription with 7-day free trial.\n\nUpgrade to the Premium version and get unlimited access to all games without ads!\n\n— Subscription payments will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of your purchase and upon commencement of each renewal term.

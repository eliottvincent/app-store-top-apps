From bite-sized lessons and effortless learning to streaks and gamification, Duolingo Math takes everything you love about Duolingo and brings it to math.\n\nDid you know over 90% of US adults admit to experiencing math anxiety? It’s true. Math anxiety prevents many people from enjoying math and developing basic proficiency. But, it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nWhether you're an adult who wants to strengthen your everyday math skills, or a student studying math for the first time, you'll absolutely love learning with Duolingo Math. Plus, you can do it anywhere, anytime. \n\nWhy Duolingo Math?\n• Learn by doing, not viewing. Math is usually taught with textbooks, videos and lectures. But, math is a lot more fun when you can touch it, break it into pieces, and move it around. This is the new way to learn math.\n• Enjoy all the best features of Duolingo, but for math. After a decade of developing the world's most popular language learning app, we know how to make learning fun. Start your 10-day streak learning math now, and you'll thank yourself later.\n• Train your brain with something that's actually useful. Brain training apps and sudoku can be a good mental challenge, but they aren't helping you develop a valuable skill. Improving your mental math skills with Duolingo Math will come in handy all the time.\n\nWhat does Duolingo Math teach?\n• Elementary math, including topics like multiplication, addition, and fractions for students\n• Everyday math skills for adults to exercise their brains\n\nQuestions?

      "label": "Всего за несколько минут в день вы научитесь составлять предложения на английском.\n\nМы специально оптимизировали уроки для мобильных устройств. Информация дается в сжатом виде, затем методом многократного повторения закрепляется в памяти. \n\nВ короткие сроки вы научитесь правильно строить простые выражения, незаметно для себя выучите много новых слов. \n\nКак проходят занятия\n\nЗанятия проходят в игровой форме. Программа предлагает простое выражение на русском языке. Из английских слов на экране нужно составить правильный ответ. Если вы ответили правильно программа похвалит вас, если вдруг ошиблись – подскажет правильный ответ.\n\nПравильный ответ озвучиваются.\n\nВ любое время можно прочитать теоретический материал или заглянуть в подсказку. Подсказка синхронизирована с заданием. \n\nВ качестве подсказки предлагается таблица спряжения английских глаголов по временам. Отображается тот глагол, который употребляется в задании.\nЗанимаясь в программе, вы попутно выучите основные неправильные глаголы.\n\nМетод хорошо зарекомендовал себя для начинающих изучать английский с нуля и для продолжающих.\n\nСписок уроков:\n\n1. Базовая форма глагола.\n2. Местоимения. Вопросительные слова.\n3. Глагол \"to be\". Предлоги места. Like/Want.\n4. Притяжательные местоимения.\n5. Профессии. Этикет.\n6. Степени сравнения прилагательных. Указательные местоимения.\n7. Слова-параметры. Употребление much и many.\n8. Предлоги и параметры времени.\n9. There is / There are.\n10. Предлоги направления и движения.\n11. Модальные глаголы can, must, should.\n12. Continuous\n13. Прилагательные. Описание людей. Погода\n14. Present Perfect\n15. Повелительное наклонение\n16. Фразовые глаголы\n\nМатериал изучается последовательно. Контроль изучения реализован следующим образом:\n\n• за правильные ответы начисляются баллы\n• без активации доступен один урок\r\n• после активации доступны все уроки по мере набора 4.5 балла в предыдущем\r\n\nАлгоритм начисления баллов:\n\nПрограмма помнит 100 последних ответов, количество ПРАВИЛЬНЫХ ответов делит на 100 и умножает на 5. Чтобы набрать 4.5 балла, надо ответить правильно на 90 вопросов из 100.\n\nАлгоритм расчета баллов позволяет быстро перейти к следующему уроку, если вы знаете тему хорошо, и не позволит этого сделать, если ваших знаний недостаточно.\n\nДля тех, кто хорошо знает язык, в программе реализован режим повышенной сложности (включается в настройках). В сложном режиме ответ требуется ввести с клавиатуры по буквам, а не выбрать из представленных на экране вариантов. То есть надо знать как пишутся английские слова.\n\nПодробнее об этой и других программах для изучения иностранных языков читайте на нашем сайте:\n* http://polyglotmobile.ru/\n\nПрисоединяйтесь к нам ВКонтакте.\n* http://vk.com/polyglotmobile\n\nПолиглотом может стать каждый!"

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nSecure\nLike the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom."

The Science Journal transforms smartphones and tablets into science notebooks that encourage students to explore their world.\n\nThe Arduino Science Journal app is recommended for students from 10 to 18 years of age.\n\nAbout Arduino Science Journal\nWith the Arduino Science Journal, you can learn interactively, conduct experiments and iterate on findings.\n\n•  Enhance your existing lesson plans: use the Science Journal with activities and assignments you have already prepared\n•  Classroom & home-school friendly: you don’t have to be in a classroom setting to start exploring. The Arduino Science Journal can be used to run experiments straight away, as long as you have your smartphone or tablet with you! \n•  Move learning outside: the use of mobile devices along with the types of experiments we offer encourage students to get out of their seats and open their eyes to the world around them through the power of science\n•  Science and data have no secrets: you can easily record your observations, store your data sensors in real-time and analyse them, just as a proper scientist! \n•  Connect the digital and the physical world from your pocket: go through a series of simple tutorials and start having fun with science\n\nWith built-in device sensors as well as external hardware, you can measure light, sound, movement, and much more.  You can also compare results, and even set triggers. \n\nTogether with the external hardware, (not included with the app), students are enabled to conduct more complex experiments, and advance in their scientific studies. As long as the external sensors are compatible with a Bluetooth-connecting device such as a microcontroller, there is no end to what experiments the students can make. Some popular sensors that the app can work with are: light, conductivity, temperature, force, gas, heart rate, respiration, radiation, pressure, magnetism, and many more.\n\nThe app is classroom-friendly, since students can sign in on any device and access their experiments to continue exploring the world, wherever they are!\n\nIf you’re an educator with a Google Classroom account, you can also subscribe to the Teacher Plan, which allows you to integrate the app with Google Classroom and share this integration with your students. You can then create assignments, templates, and experiments in the app and import existing classes from Google Classroom.\n\nPermissions notice:\n\n• Bluetooth: needed to scan for Bluetooth sensor devices.\n• Camera: needed to take pictures to document experiments and for the brightness sensor.\n• Photo Library: needed to store pictures taken to document experiments and for adding existing photos from your library to experiments.\n• Microphone: needed for sound intensity sensor.\n• Push notifications: needed to inform you of recording status when backgrounding the app.\n\nBenefits of using the Arduino Science Journal\n• It’s free and simple to use\n• Easy setup: download the app and start exploring with your phone’s built-in sensors\n• Cross-platform support\n• Portable: enhance your home learning or bring your device outside to study the world around you\n• Safe for children to use: COPPA Compliance underway \n• Fully compatible with Arduino hardware: keep experimenting with the Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab, as well as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board\n• Google Drive integration, as well as local download\n\n---\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://www.arduino.cc/en/sj-terms-conditions\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy\nChildren's Privacy Policy: https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy/children-privacy-policy"

APRENDIZAJE DE LA GRAMÁTICA con reglas bien ilustrativas\n2. ENTRENADOR para reforzar el vocabulario y las reglas\n3. MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO con ayuda de asociaciones\n4. COMPRENSIÓN AUDITIVA para aprender a entender el lenguaje oral\n5. CHECKPONTS para controlar lo aprendido y subsanar lagunas\n6. ¡PRÁCTICAS INUSUALES! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado para consolidar los conocimientos\n\nSimpler es ideal para principiantes. Con su ayuda puede aprender inglés desde cero. Asimismo puede hacer una prueba de nivel y empezar a estudiar a partir de cualquier nivel\n\n=====================\n\n¿POR QUÉ SIMPLER ES EL MÉTODO MÁS RÁPIDO Y EFICAZ DE APRENDER INGLÉS?\n\n1. Hemos creado el SISTEMA DE ENSEÑANZA DE LA GRAMÁTICA más claro y sencillo, conveniente a los principiantes. No le hace falta adentrarse en los mínimos detalles de la gramática inglesa, ni leer libros de texto. Descompusimos el inglés en átomos, seleccionamos solo la info más relevante, la reconstituimos y convertimos en estructuras fáciles e inteligibles. Cada regla gramatical del curso autodidacta Simpler es una instrucción corta que enseguida se refuerza con preguntas y prácticas.\n\n2. Hemos creado un SISTEMA sencillo y claro de MEMORIZACIÓN DEL VOCABULARIO INGLÉS. Aparte de la traducción, se visualiza una imagen especial que ilustra el significado de la palabra desconocida. Además, se le muestra un texto asociativo que acompaña la imagen y le permite idear sus propias asociaciones mnemónicas. El curso autodidacta Simpler organiza el repaso del vocabulario en intervalos que fueron calculados con la curva del olvido de Ebbinghaus. ¡Con Simpler su vocabulario de inglés se ampliará notablemente!\n\n3. Es imprescindible poder entender el lenguaje oral en inglés. Para ello, los audios de las frases fueron grabados por hablantes nativos, lo que es especialmente importante para aquellos que empiezan a estudiar inglés desde cero. Asimismo, creamos un apartado especial de audiciones que llamamos PRÁCTICAS. Después de estudiar las reglas gramaticales, se le ofrece una tarea auditiva con el fin de entender frases en inglés.\n\n4. Creamos un sistema de tareas de toda clase que llamamos ENTRENADOR. Incluye una gama de actividades variadas que suponen un entrenamiento de traducción de frases del español al inglés y viceversa. Además, las reglas están pensadas de tal manera que el estudiante pueda aprender a aplicarlas con facilidad. Las lecciones del Simpler no se pasan al olvido, gracias a que el ENTRENADOR incluya también actividades de lecciones anteriores.\n\n5. ¡EXCLUSIVIDAD! Historias policíacas en inglés adaptado. Le harán pensar en inglés, con ellas podrá ampliar su vocabulario y mejorar la destreza oral.\n\n6. ¡La eficacia está en la regularidad! Para mantener su motivación a aprender inglés, hacemos constancia de su TRABAJO A TODO RITMO. ¡Estudie todos los días y los resultados no se harán esperar!\n\n7. ¡Gane ESTRELLAS, desbloquee lecciones, trabaje a destajo y reciba regalos!\n\n==========================\n\nOPCIONES DE USO DEL CURSO AUTODIDACTA DE INGLÉS SIMPLER\n• La suscripción Premium le permite aprender inglés accediendo a todo el funcional de la app.\n• Después de confirmar la compra, el cargo se realizará desde su cuenta iTunes. \n• La suscripción se renovará automáticamente a no ser desactivada 24 horas antes del vencimiento del periodo actual.
